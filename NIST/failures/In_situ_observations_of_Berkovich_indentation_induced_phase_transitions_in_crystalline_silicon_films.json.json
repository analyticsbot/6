{"abstract": "The pressure induced phase transitions of crystalline Si films was studied in situ under a Berkovich probe using the Raman spectroscopy-enhanced instrumented indentation technique. The observations suggested strain and time as important parameters in the nucleation and growth of high-pressure phases and, in contrast to earlier reports, indicate that pressure release is not a precondition for transformation to high pressure phases.", "citation": "Scripta Materialia", "volume": "120", "pdf_filename": "", "authors": "Yvonne B.
