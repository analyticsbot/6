The UEC is the group that represents the user of the National Synchrotron Light Source, which is currently in its final year of operation, and the National Synchrotron Light Source II, which begins operations later this year. This is a volunteer effort for Dr. Calvin and myself. The UEC is underwriting production and construction costs for the book. The initial run will yield 500 copies. Most of the copies will belong to the UEC for use in its outreach and education efforts.", "meta": {"nist": {"volume": "", "proceedings": "", "dates": "2016-06-13T00:00:00", "location": "", "pdf_filename": "", "authors": "Bruce D.
