{"abstract": "The Smart Grid is a new type of power grid that will provide reliable, secure, and efficient energy transmission and distribution. It promises to integrate distributed energy resources with conventional generation plants, and intelligently transmit energy to meet changing requests from users. How to best utilize distributed energy resources and minimize energy transmission overhead is a critical issue. In this paper, we develop a set of distributed energy routing protocols that optimize the network globally or perform suboptimal resource assignment by partitioning the grid and applying the global optimization scheme to each region. We use simulations to show that these routing protocols can more efficiently allocate energy than conventional load balancing protocols.", "citation": "", "volume": "", "pdf_filename": "", "authors": "Jie  Lin; Guobin  Xu; David W.
