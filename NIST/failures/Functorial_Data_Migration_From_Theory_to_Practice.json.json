{"abstract": "In this paper we describe a functorial data migration [6] scenario about the manufacturing service capability of a distributed supply chain. The scenario is a category-theoretic analog of an OWL ontology-based \\semantic enrichment\" scenario [5] developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The scenario is presented using, and is included with, the open-source FQL tool, available for download at categoricaldata.net/fql.html.", "citation": "NIST Interagency/Internal Report (NISTIR) - 8088", "volume": "", "pdf_filename": "", "authors": "Eswaran  Subrahmanian; Ryan  Wisnesky; David   Spivak; Patrick  Schultz;", "keywords": "Functorial Data Migration, Manufacturing services, Category theory", "pages": "", "dates": "", "pdf_text": "", "title": "Functorial Data Migration: From Theory to Practice", "url": "http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=919457", "proceedings": "", "location": "", "published": "November 03, 2014", "issue": ""}
