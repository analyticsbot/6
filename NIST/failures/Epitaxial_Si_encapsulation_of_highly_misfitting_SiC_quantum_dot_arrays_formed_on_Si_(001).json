Using transmission electron microscopy we show how the crystalline quality of the Si cap depends on the growth conditions. Overgrowth at 300oC leads to a planar, epitaxial Si cap, but with small crystallographic rotations in the cap above each quantum dot. At 400oC growth temperature, Si exhibits reduced sticking to the SiC, leading to a non-planar cap. However, a two-step process, with thin layer grown at 250oC followed by growth at 500oC, leads to a planar cap with a much-reduced density of defects.", "meta": {"nist": {"volume": "104", "proceedings": "", "dates": "2016-06-13T00:00:00", "location": "", "pdf_filename": "", "authors": "Christopher W.
