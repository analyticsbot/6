My memories   from my childhood are centered on my father's medical conditions   alongside my constant desire to understand the principles of the nature   around me. The hard conditions didn't dampen my enormous curiosity.   Already at five, I was actively investigating the world. In one of my experiments   I tried to measure the height of our tiny balcony using the furniture   from inside the apartment. I put a table on another table, and then a chair   and a stool on top, but did not reach the ceiling. Hence, I climbed up on   my construct, fell down to the back yard on the ground floor and broke my   arm ... Incidentally, the results of this experiment are still unknown, since the   current tenants in the apartment have remodeled the ceiling. ", "title": "Ada E.
