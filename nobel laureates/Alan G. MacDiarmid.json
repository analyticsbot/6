My father, an engineer, was unemployed for four years during   the Great Depression which hit New Zealand rather severely in the   early 1930s. Since jobs were believed to be more plentiful in the   vicinity of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, located   at the bottom of the North Island, we moved to Lower Hutt a few   miles from Wellington. There my two older brothers and my elder   sister were able to find jobs while I and my younger sister were   still at primary school.", "title": "Alan G.
