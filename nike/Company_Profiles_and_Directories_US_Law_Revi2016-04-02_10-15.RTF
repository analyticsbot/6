\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods and his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball set the 100th U.S. Open at Pebble Beach on fire last weekend when he blazed a record-breaking 15-stroke win, breaking a margin-of-win record for a major championship that's been around since 1862. That's right, 1862. And while the win thrilled the people at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, the blaze hardly sent even small wafts of smoke here. A fast check of area golf courses and golfing equipment shops showed minimal interest in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Wood's new ball of choice (and endorsement). However, Joel Puckett at Baltimore-Washington Golf in Towson said there has been significant interest in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball since Tiger's win. Before that, he said, they had been selling \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls, without great success, since \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first made them available.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Nick Price-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -Chipshot.com saga has been proceeding at a dizzying pace.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest: After \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it was suing chipshot.com for using Price in ads with him not wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -contracted shoes and clothes, Price said he was through with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Price, who didn't wear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf gear two weeks ago at the Byron Nelson Classic, probably got mad and felt better, but was it good business to say goodbye to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike?\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He turned his back on close to $2 million in endorsement income for 2000, not to mention performance bonuses of about $500,000. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  apparel and footwear catalogue for retailers features Tiger Woods, of course, but Price is all over the thing, representing the ''classic'' designs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - - -
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best example that the score is ultimately all that matters comes from none other than Seve Ballesteros.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the second round of the recent French Open, Ballesteros hit one tee shot so far left that it cleared a lake and landed in the adjacent fairway, some 100 yards off target. From there, Ballesteros hit a 9-iron to six feet and made the birdie.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''I hit it only three times. That's what counts,'' Ballesteros said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This from the same man who, when asked what happened on a four-putt, once said, ''I miss the putt. I miss the putt. I miss the putt. I hole the putt.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - - -
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The only one who might have suffered more than Ernie Els and David Duval at the Masters was Kieran Docherty, the caddie for Carlos Franco who tore the ACL in his right knee during the third round at Augusta.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Doc,'' who lives in B.C., may not be able to have surgery until the fall because he's classified as a ''non- emergency.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with carrying the bag the past five years, Docherty is the travel agent, chauffeur and business manager for Franco, who speaks little English. Both speak a little Japanese.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is launching hi-tech trainers called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox that put a spring in your step. They go on sale in the US next month at about \'a3100 a pair. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox feature spring-like columns in the heels made from resilient foam similar to that used in the noses of Formula One racing cars. The springs produce a "trampoline-style" effect, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims. "This industry needs a lightning rod right now," says Dave Larson, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  director of brand initiatives. Sales are flat, and retailers are looking for a kick-start. We're doing what we can to jazz up the industry."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertising campaign is built around a single word : Boing. Why Boing? Because consumers used the word repeatedly during testing, Larson said. "We figure one word sums it up."

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said this week that it was branching out from athletic shoes and clothing by forming a division for high-technology sports gear that will introduce five gadgets for athletes this year.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is teaming up with S3 Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., on the first product, a portable audio player that will be introduced in July. Terms were not disclosed. A heart-rate monitor, a speed-and-distance monitor, a compass and a two-way radio are to be introduced by the holiday shopping season. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The move into electronics by the world's largest maker of athletic shoes comes as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and its rivals struggle with slowing sales caused by a shift in consumer tastes to dressier apparel. Just two days ago, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  named its president and chief operating officer, Thomas E. Clarke, 48, to lead new business ventures aimed at improving operations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  got this great brand," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation. "Trying to leverage that brand into other products makes sense."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John J. Shanley, an analyst at First Security Van Kasper, said he expected demand for the new products to be limited. "I do not really expect this to develop into a huge business opportunity for the company," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is terminating its contract to provide hockey equipment to Brown University, fearing the school may try to make it comply with guidelines of a group pushing for better working conditions in clothing factories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it objected to being held to the code of conduct outlined by the Workers Rights Consortium, of which Brown was a founding member, because the company disagreed with the group's approach. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The W.R.C. is based on a 'gotcha' monitoring technique," Simon Pestridge, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labor practices manager, said. He said members went to factories and reported on what they found rather than work with factories to effect change. He said the W.R.C.'s definition of a living wagewas too vague.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Brown notified \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in late January that it wanted to renegotiate its contract with the Beaverton, Ore., company, to require it to comply with Brown's code of conduct.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Brown and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were in the middle of a three-year contract, in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  provided the men's and women's hockey teams with skates, gloves, pads and other goods under the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Bauer labels.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the Greek goddess of victory, has smiled upon a Spanish perfume company in a trademark war with the US footwear giant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Yesterday the High Court cleared the way for Spain's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  perfumes to return to the Australian market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They would not be mistaken as products of the footwear and clothing behemoth, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc, the court held.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In 1993 Campomar, whose trademark \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  perfume dated back to 1940 in Spain, marketed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Sport Fragrance in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was positioned in pharmacies near other sport fragrances, including an offering by Adidas, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc's rival.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc took a successful trademark action in the Federal Court, saying Campomar was taking advantage of its goodwill and reputation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Upholding Campomar's appeal yesterday, the High Court said there was "no reasonable probability of (consumer) confusion".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc had not marketed perfumes under the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trademark, the court noted, and in the mid-1980s a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc executive had rebuffed a joint venture suggestion from Campomar, saying "we do not believe perfume and cosmetic products are part of this company's image".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Legendary rock star Bo Diddley has sued \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. for using his name and image without permission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 71-year-old musician, whose real name is Ellas McDaniel, sued \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  late Wednesday, alleging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenues from sales of T-shirts bearing Diddley's name, likeness and the inscription: You Don't Know Diddley, without authorization. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a clear case of the big bully picking on the little guy. Apparently \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  really doesn't know Diddley," said Margo Lewis, president of Talent Source, Diddley's management company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vada Manager, a senior official with Beaverton, Ore.-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the company is negotiating with Diddley's lawyers and has authorized offering a royalty payment of between $10,000 and $15,000. He said he did not think Diddley's lawyers had received the offer yet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Rosenberg, one of Diddley's lawyers said negotiations had broken off in March.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We rejected their proposal ... We've had no communication with them in about a month. We stand by the lawsuit and we intend to proceed," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  GIANT American sporting footwear manufacture \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday emerged with half a victory in its legal battle with a Spanish firm which presumed to market its perfume as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Sport Fragrance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The High Court in Canberra yesterday allowed an appeal by the firm Campomar Sociedad Limitada against a Federal Court order which would have struck out its trademark registration of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name for its perfumes, soaps and cosmetics. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Campomar still faces an injunction barring it from marketing its sport fragrance in a manner which exploits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  high public profile. This follows similar litigation between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Campomar in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  failure to achieve outright victory stems from some fundamental problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The High Court said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was not an invented word.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Greek mythology, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the goddess of victory. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was also the name of a family of surface-to-air guided missiles developed by the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campomar's predecessor company registered the name \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Spain for its perfumes and essences in 1940. The name has been registered in various other countries at various times ever since.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In contrast, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  company was first incorporated in the US in 1969 and sold its shoes and sportswear in Australia from 1972.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Others, including Lee Trevino, are trying not to yawn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When you take in Woods' entire endorsement and money-generating power, $ 20 million a year is no reason for bold headlines. For a golfer, yes, but Woods jumped past that level long ago and now commands Muhammad Ali-like appeal worldwide. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Cheap," Trevino said this week about Tiger's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures. "They got him cheap."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Golf World calculates that when the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract begins in August next year, Woods' total endorsement earnings will surpass $ 54 million a year --- without tournament winnings, appearance fees and investments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That number is consistent with a comment made recently by Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, who said his client makes $ 1 million a week, even if he doesn't play.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal reportedly also includes a share of the profits for Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It wouldn't surprise me somewhere down the line if he doesn't negotiate his own television contract," Trevino said. "ABC comes to him and says, 'OK, we've got 12 tournaments we're televising. We're going to give you $ 20 million, and you guarantee us you'll play 10 of them."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Hooters points championship
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Peachtree City-based NGA Hooters Tour has its own Tiger Woods dominator this year --- 26-year-old Chad Campbell of Andrews, Texas, with eight victories and $ 186,000 in earnings. Campbell, the tour's points champion the past two seasons, takes the lead into next week's Naturally Fresh Foods Points Tour Championship at Whitewater Country Club. . . . This week's Safeway LPGA Golf Championship in Portland, Ore., is the final qualifying event for the Oct. 6-8 Solheim Cup at Loch Lomond, Scotland. . . . Tony Navarro, known for his caddie duties with Greg Norman, has been toting the bag of Augusta's Charles Howell.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Rejuvenated Elkington back
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Steve Elkington, who underwent arthroscopic hip surgery Aug. 11, returned as rapidly as close friend Norman had recommended. Elkington is playing this week in the Westin Texas Open and is in the field for next week's Buick Challenge at Callaway Gardens, where he is a two-time champion. "I feel like a 15-year-old again," Elkington said. "I haven't had this much strength and energy in years."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first of five new products is a digital audio player that will be in stores in July and was produced in collaboration with S3's Diamond Multimedia division -- makers of Rio Audio digital players.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  BEAVERTON, Ore. (Reuters) - Adidas America Inc., the U.S. unit of the German sportswear giant, has joined arch rival \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. to file suit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., alleging the retailer sells counterfeit brand-name T- shirts at its wholesale club stores. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas America, its parent Adidas-Salomon AG, Adidas International BV of the Netherlands, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  filed suit against Wal-Mart in U.S. federal district court in New York, claiming the world's largest retailer has been selling several styles of counterfeit Adidas and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  T-shirts at its Sam's Club wholesale club stores.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also alleged that Wal-Mart has been selling other counterfeit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products at Sam's Club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  become the fifth and sixth major sportswear companies to sue Wal-Mart for selling counterfeits in the last two years, the two companies said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In 1998, Tommy Hilfiger brought two actions against Wal-Mart for selling counterfeit goods. Wal-Mart paid out an unprecedented $6.4 million (U.S.) to settle those lawsuits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In November, 1998, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica and Fubu lodged similar claims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Wal-Mart closed down 69 cents at $59.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 After blowing away his competition and winning three consecutive major championships this summer, Tiger Woods' new contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appears to be following the same theme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In other words, it's very major. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The agreement is worth a reported $ 100 million, and Bob Wood, president of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf division, said Woods signed a five-year extension Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His agent, Mark Steinberg, told the Associated Press that the contract " compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but what he has done for golf and sports."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' first contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signed when he turned pro in 1996, was said to be worth about $ 40 million --- then a landmark amount for a golfer. A $ 100 million deal could qualify as the largest contract in sports marketing history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods will be heavily involved with TV ads and marketing when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as expected, jumps into the golf-club market. Already, he has jacked up sales of the company's Tour Accuracy ball, which he used during record wins in the U.S.  Open, British Open and PGA Championship.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said today that its first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, beating Wall Street forecasts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company, based in Beaverton, posted net income of $210 million, or 77 cents a share, for the three months ended Aug. 31, compared with $200 million, or 70 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Revenue rose 5 percent, to $2.6 billion from $2.5 billion a year earlier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Analysts had expected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to post earnings of 74 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before the company announced the results, its shares closed at $38.50, down 12.5 cents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're off to a good start for the fiscal year with accelerating revenue growth and increasing profitability," said Philip H. Knight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman and chief executive. "I'm particularly pleased by the strength of our international businesses, which generated double-digit revenue growth, despite significant currency weakness in Europe."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the weakness in the euro put pressure on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  profitability, although it was able to meet its goals.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  closely watched worldwide "futures" -- orders for goods to be delivered over the next five months -- totaled $3.1 billion, equal to the year-earlier level. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said that had the dollar remained constant, futures orders would have increased 4 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United States revenue rose 2 percent, to $1.4 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the period a year earlier. Athletic footwear revenue fell 1 percent, to $935 million. Apparel revenue fell 2 percent, to $326 million. Equipment revenue rose 55 percent, to $91 million. Quarterly revenue for the European region rose 6 percent, to $776 million. Footwear revenue rose 10 percent and apparel revenue rose 1 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew 26 percent, to $241 million. In constant dollars, regional revenue rose 20 percent. Revenue in the Americas region rose 15 percent, to $150 million.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What could those folks at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been thinking when they approved that slasher commercial for the Olympics?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you watched some of the early days of NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics, you were treated to a commercial that showed a woman runner starting to undress when she is startled by an evil, chainsaw-wielding, masked intruder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The would-be murderer chases the woman, clad in running shorts and a sports bra, out of her house and into the woods, but he clearly cannot keep up with her as she runs away into the night. The message, I suppose, is to get in shape and save your life. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What numbskull at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thought that was cute, especially during a family-oriented sporting event such as the Olympics? NBC pulled the spots because of complaints from viewers, but why did they have to wait until they received the complaints?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Do you suppose nobody at NBC, during the network's own review of that commercial, wasn't disgusted enough to question its propriety? Or was the money just too good?
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Scott Reames told Newhouse News Service that the ad was meant to appeal to young, athletic consumers. "We really feel that people who get \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will get the ad," the agency quoted him as saying.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People who "get" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will "get" the ad? I've purchased many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products over the years, and have been mostly pleased. But the only thing I "get" when I think of that ad is nauseous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CINCINNATI DESERVES congratulations for having the determination to change its method of paying the city's public school teachers. For the first time, teachers will be paid based on performance and not seniority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How much simpler could it be? Certainly, years of experience help when teachers confront familiar problems, but we've all had teachers (or watch in frustration as our sons or daughters do) who use the same curriculum year in and year out, simply going through the motions, counting the years to retirement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cincinnati's new system would enable a teacher who does excellent work year after year to reach a top pay level of $62,500 in eight years. Under the current seniority-based system, a teacher would not reach the top pay level of $56,230 until he or she has 27 years of service.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evaluation system was developed after a year-and-a-half of collaboration by teachers, their union and the district's administrators. The teachers will be evaluated, every five years, on 16 standards, such as class preparation and creating a learning-conducive environment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Predictably, Cleveland Teachers Union president Richard DeColibus said it wouldn't work here because the district has too many vacancies on the staff. That was the same reason he used to defend the union's demand for twice the salary increases that the district's other unions agreed to in recent contract talks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I can't help but think that if a teacher knew he or she could make more than $62,000 in just eight years, many of those openings might disappear.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has withdrawn millions of dollars in financial support from three universities in the past three weeks. The schools -- the University of Michigan, the University of Oregon and Brown University -- recently have joined a student-led group that wants to impose tougher standards concerning wages and working conditions in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overseas factories, which some critics have called sweatshops. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairperson Phil Knight's decisions, college officials say, constitute a form of retaliation against the institutions for their stances on the labour issue. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had contracts under which it outfitted all of Michigan's varsity athletic teams and Brown's men's and women's hockey teams. Knight, who has given millions of dollars to Oregon, had planned to donate $30 million toward an $80-million renovation of the football stadium.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the Editor:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Re "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Power Game" and "Good Propaganda, Bad Economics" (Op-Ed, May 16): I commend the University of Oregon for arriving at its decision to join the Worker Rights Consortium thoughtfully and democratically. The ensuing withdrawal by Phil Knight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief executive, of a $30 million contribution was an I'll-take-my-ball-and-go-home reaction to an important issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are interested in working to alleviate poor working conditions in certain countries, then they should engage in serious discussions with the Worker Rights Consortium. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't, perhaps Mr. Knight could still demonstrate his dedication to improving workers' rights by taking the $30 million and using it to raise some workers' wages and benefits.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sir: I was very surprised on reading Nick Harris's article about the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sponsorship of Manchester United (4 November) to see no mention of the "anti -sweatshop" movement which has been putting pressure on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recently. Perhaps in Britain this is still not a factor, but over here in the United States it has become an important issue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is alleged that, through subcontractors, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  employs people in Third World countries for very low wages with terrible working conditions. It is also alleged that although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has the capacity to insist on better conditions for these workers it is usually only concerned with getting the cheapest rate it can on the production of its equipment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United might come to regret an association with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in which the club is locked in by contract. As you say, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can break the deal any time it likes if United's performance gets worse, but you make no mention of the reverse being true when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name becomes more associated with Dickensian working conditions.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Beaverton, Ore.,-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will pay nearly $675 million to outfit English soccer champion Manchester United from 2002 to 2015.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Manchester United will split any profits, over and above the licensing fees, from Manchester licensing, sales and retail operations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The agreement will allow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to sell clothes with the Manchester United logo.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Barcelona and AC Milan have dismissed reports that the Spanish soccer giant has offered $3.2 million to the Italian team as an incentive to beat Leeds United in their European Champions League game this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Barcelona needs Milan to beat the English side to have a chance of staying the Champions League.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Barcelona sports newspaper quoted Milan's Spanish striker Jose Mari Romero as saying: "I'm one of those people who thinks that giving someone money to win is not illegal. If [Barcelona chairman Joan] Gaspart wants to give us something, we will receive it with glee. But nobody has offered us any money and I don't think they will."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bari was fined $3,525 because its fans booed AC Parma's Cameroon striker Patrick Mboma, who scored the winning goal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chorus-like racial chants are becoming more and more common at Italian soccer games.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bo Diddley Sues Over \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  T-Shirts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rock star BO DIDDLEY says that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the clothing and athletic-shoe company, didn't know Diddley about T-shirts bearing the legend "You Don't Know Diddley." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the 71-year-old musician accused \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of selling thousands of T-shirts bearing the four-word line and his picture in the last year without his permission. In 1989, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signed a two-year agreement that led to television commercials with Bo Diddley, whose real name is Ellas McDaniel, and the athlete Bo Jackson. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also made T-shirts with the "You Don't Know Diddley" slogan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Mr. McDaniel's lawsuit says that the agreement expired in 1991. The company contacted his managers last year about making more T-shirts, but the two sides could not come to terms. Mr. McDaniel said that nevertheless, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  began selling the T-shirts in catalogs and on the Internet, and ignored a cease-and-desist letter from his lawyer. A call to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman was not returned yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a clear case of the big bully picking on the little guy," said MARGO LEWIS, the president of Talent Source Ltd., Mr. McDaniel's management company. "In the past, many entertainers of the 50's and 60's found themselves, for whatever reason, unable to protect their rights. We are no longer operating in that environment."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Patricia Duff Takes the Stand
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PATRICIA DUFF was questioned yesterday about what she reported and did not report to the authorities during her marriage to the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In her first day on the witness stand at their child-custody trial, one of Mr. Perelman's lawyers, CHARLES A. STILLMAN, questioned her about police reports that she had filed over the years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Specifically, he asked her about an incident in Los Angeles, when she called the police and reported that a man staying in a hotel room next to hers was following her and taking pictures, and a 1997 call she placed to the police in Fairfield, Conn., where she had a house.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In that call, she described marks on the door to a locked room where she kept documents relating to her divorce. She suggested to the police that the door could have been removed from its hinges and replaced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a later exchange about the security guard who worked in her house, Mr. Stillman noted that Ms. Duff had approved the security company that had been hired. She objected, saying she had been forced to choose a security company from a list provided by Mr. Perelman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I would have chosen a different company, not a company that specialized in surveillance and investigation," she said. "I don't think you can begin to imagine if you had someone in your midst 24 hours a day, on the street, in your car invading your privacy 24 hours a day."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She was also asked about a $650,000 pearl necklace she reported missing to the Fairfield police in January 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she filed that report after she and an appraiser from Sotheby's went to a bank where she believed it was in a safe deposit box. But the necklace was not there. She later told the police she was not sure whether it had been in the vault, in her house in Connecticut or somewhere else. The necklace has never been found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She was also questioned about why she had not reported the abuse she said in court papers that she had endured during her marriage to Mr. Perelman. Ms. Duff testified that she had reported the incidents to the Manhattan district attorney's office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We do not comment on complaints unless there is a resulting arrest," said BARBARA THOMPSON, a spokeswoman for the office. "There are many reasons why a complaint may not result in an arrest. For example, after an investigation it may be determined that no crime was committed or that the evidence is insufficient to prove any charges."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms. Duff is expected to testify again today.   JAMES BARRON with David Rohde

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  CARVES NEW NICHENot enough sneakers to choose from at the store?\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is hoping to lure demanding shoppers with its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ID service, an online store that allows users to customize their shoes.It's not exactly building a shoe from scratch - the options consist largely of choosing between a running shoe and a cross-trainer, playing with the color scheme and choosing an "ID" - an eight-character word, phrase or nickname to be printed across the back.On the other hand, the site is well-designed and eye-catching, as one might expect from marketing-savvy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The idea is somewhat intriguing and the site is easy to use, if somewhat slow to load on a standard phone connection. (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warns that the initial download time can be up to 10 minutes).On the screen, an image of the shoe changes with each click of the mouse, adding or subtracting colors and highlights. The chosen iD also appears across the back of the prototype sneaker.The shoes are priced at about $10 above regular retail value - $80 for the Air Famished cross-trainer and $85 for the Air Turbulence running shoe, for example - and take about three weeks to manufacture and ship. Both are available in men's and women's models.The company says each shoe is made only after the order is placed. It may seem strange to buy a shoe without trying it on, but the cachet of having a personalized shoe is worth it to many shoppers. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  return policy is quite reasonable. A return form will be enclosed with each iD order. Consumers simply note the reason for the return and pack the product - in its original package, if possible. Products can be shipped back to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com or returned to any NikeTown or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Factory Store.One note: The shipping fee will be refunded only if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  screws up the order - so if you want to change size, you have to pay the shipping three times (to you, to them and back to you) unless you take the product to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  store.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A BLACK \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  T-shirt gave police the vital clue in tracking down three youths suspected of stealing 25 vehicles for joyrides over the last few months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the youths, an 18-year-old, had provided the investigation team with valuable video footage. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Senior staff sergeant Kumar Vellasamy, one of the team members, said: "The suspect was caught on closed-circuit security camera wearing the T-shirt."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The youth was also spotted wearing the same T-shirt at various crime scenes in the Jurong area and when loitering in carparks with his accomplices, aged 21 and 22.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All three are believed to have started their crime spree from July.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police said they had used duplicate keys to break into the vehicles -- mainly old cars and vans -- at public carparks in Jurong, Boon Lay and Chua Chu Kang housing estates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They took the vehicles for joyrides. If a stolen car ran out of petrol, they would abandon it and steal another one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it was the end of the road for them on Wednesday, when they were rounded up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A team of 11 officers from the Jurong Police Division arrested them at 11 am near a Jurong West block of flats.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stolen vehicles have all been recovered by the police.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police team's investigations led them to a petrol kiosk in Jurong West, one at which nearby residents had informed them was frequented by the three youths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And it was at the kiosk that police officers found the video footage of the 18-year-old culprit.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said today that its profit rose 17 percent in its most recent quarter, beating Wall Street's estimates, even though sales were slightly lower.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company, based in Beaverton, said it earned $145.3 million, or 52 cents a diluted share, in the period, which ended Feb. 29 and was the third quarter of its fiscal year. A year earlier, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  earned $124.2 million, or 44 cents a share. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Its profit was better than the 50 cents expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stock rose $5.125, or 16 percent, to $38 on the New York Stock Exchange.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Revenue for the quarter fell 1 percent to $2.16 billion from $2.17 billion a year earlier. European revenues fell 7 percent to $558.5 million, hurt by a rising dollar against the euro.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the United States, footwear revenue grew 4 percent to $858.9 million, though athletic apparel revenue declined 12 percent to $251.8 million.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I've seen several good websites and books dedicated to helping techno- illiterate people as they begin their journeys on the Net and use basic PC functions, and this is up with the best of them. Many absolute-beginners' guides make the mistake of assuming certain competencies, such as operating a mouse, or use kiddy-talk. Not this one. Several optional learning paths are available to suit most users, and a good Netlingo glossary of technical words is included. Diligent learners are then offered useful programs to download from the Net, guidance to set up their own website, and links to a selection of recommended sites. -- David Armstrong

Pimple Portal, a site sponsored by the makers of anti- pimple products Retin-A Micro, offers all the resources needed to create a better lifestyle for your skin. Included are medical explanations of the origins of the evil zits, acne control tips, general hints on improving your complexion, and an Ask the Expert section where dermatologists and make-up artists give advice. It's all presented in a light- hearted, hip style that -- praise be -- does not patronise.

Almost every movement of the mouse brings up some interesting effects. You can also tour the building, and pictures of people working in their offices are shown. There's a gallery, too, of advertising work the company has done for other firms -- some are static ads, others show TV clips, if you have the right software.--Robin Marshall

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If Simon Whitfield had a great day in Sydney, so did \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the sport of triathlon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It was Canada's first gold medal at the Olympics,'' said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Michelle McSorley. ''And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first gold medal.''
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  already has sponsorship contracts with Victoria's big-name triathletes, Whitfield, 25, and Carol Montgomery, 34. They also have England's Simon Lessing in their stable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a safe bet that the American mega-company will do further business with Canada's new sporting hero, more serious business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whitfield and his sport have both been elevated by the events of the weekend. The toast of the entire Canadian team, Whitfield has been receiving cheers just walking down the street in Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He is the perfect icon for a sexy ''new'' sport. Young. Tanned. Cool. Eloquent. Just a little off the wall. The story goes that while a boatful of Olympic triathletes were somberly being carted across the Sydney Harbour for their race, Whitfield and Germany's Stephan Vuckovic were clowning around on the boat, putting each other in headlocks, giving each other ''noogies.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Apparently, it doesn't hurt to be loose on race day. Whitfield won gold; Vuckovic, silver. The more sombre entrants were down the list. Wait till the next Olympic triathlon - there will be 50 clowns going to the start line.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thousands of Spectators
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over-all, the sport could not have had a bigger blast on a world stage, unless, perhaps, the U.S.A. and Australia had performed better, to feed the hype. Hundreds of thousands of spectators lined the course route, next to the Sydney Opera House and Botanical Gardens. Among the crowd, reportedly, were Chelsea Clinton, daughter of the U.S. president, and swimming icon Mark Spitz.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In short, triathlon was the place to be on the opening weekend. In its first Olympic competition, triathlon was handed the keys to the Games. With a course that showcased Sydney Harbour and the famous Opera House, triathlon was the first medal sport, handpicked by the Aussies because of their deluded dream of sweeping the women's event and scooping another medal in the men's event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though Michellie Jones took silver in the women's event, their other women were shut out as a Swiss, Brigitte McMahon won the gold. The top Aussie man was Miles Stewart, in sixth place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Australia prides itself on being the best triathlon nation in the world,'' said Paul Regensburg, CBC's triathlon analyst and the director of high performance for Triathlon Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A day after Whitfield's gold medal, the host nation was doing its best to claim Whitfield for their own. His father was born in Australia and Whitfield went to school and raced here as a teenager.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One newspaper called Whitfield ''a dinki-di Australian, almost.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Aside from Australia's disappointment with the results, triathlon will take this publicity and run with it. The world looked in and found a very sexy sport, with athletes who excel at three different disciplines while confronting disaster.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most Exciting Thing on TV
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canada's two best female triathletes lost their Olympic medal dreams to bike crashes, while Whitfield himself danced around a couple of near-smashups.  ''The winner is sometimes the one who manages to have the fewest negative things happen,'' Regensburg said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both events culminated in fascinating sprints to the finish. Tests of steel wills and iron lungs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''To keep a two- hour sport interesting is not easy,'' Regensburger said. ''And we're getting E-mails from people saying it was the most exciting thing they'd ever watched on television - people who have never seen triathlon before.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Perhaps no nation will prosper more from triathlon's weekend in the Sydney sun than Canada. The Canadian Olympic delegation has been swamped with E-mails from back home, enthusing about the sport and a prospective cereal-box hero. They are writing to congratulate Whitfield, but also the Canadian women who suffered bike crashes, Montgomery and Ottawa's Sharon Donnelly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''The races showed the kind of emotional swings that are part of triathlon,'' Regensburg said. ''Kids are writing to say they are going to start triathlon tomorrow.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whitfield is practically a swimming, riding, cycling commercial for Triathlon Canada. He came out of the developmental Kids of Steel program. Last spring, Whitfield and Regensburg opened up a national training centre in Victoria. The centre has attracted 45 triathletes in the past six months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How many more will sign on today to ''triple their fun'' now that Whitfield has delivered one of the greatest moments in Olympic history?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''There's a big party back in Canada,'' Regensburg said. ''The profile of the sport has been incredible.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here's hoping triathlon's ride to mainstream doesn't ruin its innocence. Triathletes have always had a bit of the lunatic fringe in them, and therein lies the charm.

Wieden & Kennedy, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad agency, was also named as a defendant. "Me and Mrs. Jones" was the No. 1 song on the Billboard Top 40 chart for three weeks in 1972. Mr. Paul says that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  without his consent, has run ads featuring his voice singing the song. The company could not be immediately reached for comment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a move that had been anticipated for several weeks, Tiger Woods will use the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball on a long-term basis, starting with the United States Open later this month in Pebble Beach, Calif.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods's representatives at IMG announced the change yesterday. After using Titleist golf balls since turning professional, Woods switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball for the first time in competition last month at the SAP-Deutsche Bank Open in Germany. Woods finished third in Germany, and he used the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball again at the Memorial Tournament last weekend, which he won easily by five strokes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I understand the impact I can have, but it really doesn't matter if I'm not swinging the club well," Woods said at the Memorial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I need to keep playing solid golf. It's a different ball, but the best time to make a change is when you're playing well."   CLIFTON BROWN

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the Editor:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I was stunned and appalled by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad featuring the American track runner Suzy Hamilton sprinting away from a chain-saw-wielding maniac (Advertising column, Sept. 19). I could not believe that this was a commercial for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and not a trailer for a slasher movie. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The column quoted a spokeswoman for the agency that created the spot for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as saying the ad was an attempt to "present fundamental truths about sports in new and contemporary ways." I fail to see how there is anything "new and contemporary" about violence against women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nor is there any truth in the punchline of the ad: "Why sport? Because you'll live longer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Women who are the victims of assault or who are killed by men with weapons will not be protected even if they are in good shape and wearing their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sneakers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Olympic athletes at Sydney were urged yesterday to visit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  factories in Indonesia that activists contend exploit workers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Activists renewed a campaign against the international sportswear giant, releasing a report that documents claims of intimidation and harassment of union workers and women in companies contracted to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes in Indonesia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Community Aid Abroad-Oxfam Australia report, based on interviews conducted with industrial union organizers in Indonesian factories, said workers were threatened with violence if they tried to join unions; that union members were fired for small mistakes and women were intimidated into not applying for leave by being required to undergo humiliating medical examinations.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tim Connor, the author of the NikeWatch report, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was failing to protect workers' rights in its contract factories in Indonesia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Recently, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been pushing the line that it has reformed its human-rights practices," Connor said. "The truth is that [there has been] only very minor and grudging reforms. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the biggest company in the sportswear industry . . . if anyone can afford to pay workers enough to eat, enough to feed their children, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the company," Connor told a news conference in Sydney. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In response to Connor's report, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it had undertaken to raise age requirements and wages for workers in Indonesia, improved factory conditions and published factory monitoring reports as part of reforms to improve conditions for its Asian workers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "No company has done as much in terms of labour rights, code of conduct enforcement, age and wage improvements as we have," said Vada Manager, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  global issues manager. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We uphold the Olympic ideal of human dignity," the statement said. "Those campaigning to eliminate sweatshops are addressing the right issue, but targeting the wrong company." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Connor said other sportswear manufacturers were equally responsible for exploitation of workers, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was being targeted because it was the largest. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , based in Beaverton, Ore., has 708 factories operated by contract companies and employing about 550,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Canadian Olympic high jumper Mark Boswell lost $7,000 (U.S.) yesterday when he left his wallet at Brisbane Airport after arriving in Australia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Boswell, 22, believes he left his wallet in a luggage cart at the airport but he didn't realize it was missing until he was more than halfway to the Gold Coast, where the Canadian track and field team is training. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Police said the wallet was found about two hours later a few suburbs away from Brisbane airport, minus the cash. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I had it in my trolley and I guess I must have left it," said Boswell, a native of Brampton, Ont. "It's got all my stuff in it, passport, money, credit cards, everything." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Boswell, who won silver last year in the world championships, is a medal threat in Sydney. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Boswell flew into Australia early yesterday morning from Berlin, where he won the high jump at the Golden League international athletics meet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The money was earnings from a recent track meet in Greece. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although suffering from jet lag, Boswell drove back to the airport to try to find the wallet, without success. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a downer, but you know, I've just got to start refocusing and get ready for the Games," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    A Romanian horseman will miss out on the Sydney Olympics after Austrians accused him of stealing his horse. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Viorel Bobau needed only to finish a trial in Germany to attain the points necessary to represent his country in Sydney, but was stopped at the Hungary-Austria border and accused of stealing his stallion, Carnaval. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bobau, who missed out in Barcelona in 1992 when his horse fell sick, said: "After 25 years of work and sacrifice, it's sad to see your dreams die for the simple sin of being Romanian."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    How do you know the Olympics are being held in Sydney? Everyone has his hand in your pocket. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This lighthearted exchange has become common among Sydney residents in advance of the games this month as prices rise in anticipation of a gold rush from hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors. Only the sex industry vows no rise in prices. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Taxi companies joined the rush last week, announcing a 10-per-cent surcharge during the Sept. 15 to Oct. 1 event. They had asked city authorities for a 20-per-cent surcharge to encourage as many drivers as possible to work during the games. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "For sure it's literally an opportunity to charge higher prices," said Gail Kennedy, spokeswoman for the Australian Consumers' Association. "It smacks of profiteering." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Higher charges for hotel rooms were introduced at the start of this month and restaurants are poised to cut back on menu sizes, charge higher prices and impose cancellation fees if diners do not turn up after making a reservation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But many workers have secured so-called Olympic bonuses. They include train and bus drivers, security guards, hotel workers, casino staff and telecommunications staff. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's the practical reality of a big event, and what bigger event [is there] than the Olympics?" Kennedy said. "It's based on what they think the market can bear. In terms of food, maybe picnics are the way for visitors to go." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman for Sydney's Department of Fair Trading advised consumers to alert the department if they were hit with a charge they had not been warned about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    The drug ban of Olympic bycycling champion Andrea Collinelli will stand, and he can forget about competing in the Sydney Olympics. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Nothing will change," Italian Olympic Committee president Giovanni Petrucci said. "Collinelli . . . will have to give up [his attempt to go to Sydney] seeing that we had promised seriousness on the doping front." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Collinelli won the track pursuit gold in Atlanta. He had been seeking reinstatement since a laboratory in Germany found last week that there were traces of the banned painkiller lidocaine and the stimulant fentermine in a blood test from the Italian cycling track championships in July. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Collinelli followed his Olympic gold with a pair of world championships in the 4,000-metre team pursuit. He has repeatedly said his food or drinks had been laced with the banned substances.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS had to be escorted through an angry crowd of former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  workers who ambushed him in the lobby of the exclusive Bangkok hotel where he is staying for the Johnnie Walker Classic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  About 100 angry protesters, who claimed they were still waiting to receive compensation after being sacked by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in September, apparently targeted Woods because he is sponsored by the giant company to the tune of GBP 70million over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods said: 'They have their own opinions and they have the things they want to try and accomplish and you can't stop them from doing that.That's their right and so be it.' Woods, whose mother Kultida is from Thailand, had been expecting a warm welcome in the country where he has been hailed as a hero and accorded honorary citizenship. He was welcomed by his mother and hundreds of fans when his private jet touched down but was confronted by the protesters on arrival at his hotel. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The 24-year-old confessed that the relentless expectations of media and fans was hard to cope with - especially in the wake of his amazing hat-trick of major titles this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'When I first played in Thailand as an amateur in 1994 I did envisage being this successful as a player, but not all the hysteria around it off the golf course,' said Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'No-one can ever prepare you for that. All you know as a kid is that you want to hit golf shots and try to win tournaments and beat your heroes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  No-one ever thinks about the other side of it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'I know everyone wants a piece of me but it's a responsibility and I accept it and I never lose sight of my main objective, which is to play the best I can and win golf tournaments.' Woods has already claimed nine titles this season, and victory on Sunday - in an event which counts as the first towards the 2001 Order of Merit - would see his earnings for 2000 top the GBP 7m mark.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER Woods' secret has been revealed in a lawsuit claiming his sponsor \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was engaging in unfair business practices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even though he endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls in TV and magazine ads, Woods really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged after being sued in federal court in San Francisco.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said yesterday the balls Woods uses for his monster drives have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball," revealed Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros really use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products -- irons, putters and golf balls -- for tour players," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Slight specification and modifications need to be made to their equipment for their game."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the suit filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, a non-profit group called Public Remedies Inc claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , based in Beaverton, Oregon, was engaging in unfair business practices. It asks that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "ill-gotten gains" be restored to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger Woods does not play the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf ball but instead plays one with a different composition and performance characteristics specially made for him ... and not available to the general public," the lawsuit said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly what their pros endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist, said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a "tweaked" version of a club, he said, a consumer could order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are very particular about our advertisements. We don't make any claims that cannot be substantiated in both golf balls and clubs," Gomes said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Callaway Golf said that if one of its golf pros says he uses a certain club, that identical club is available retail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger's agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the lawsuit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS is on the verge of setting a new benchmark - an endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth about pounds 70 million, believed to be the richest in sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have agreed to a five-year extension to his existing deal that will pay him an average of about pounds 14 million a year, according to a source close to the negotiations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, described the deal as an "outstanding contract", but declined to discuss specifics, saying only that: "It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but what he has done for golf and sports."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bob Wood, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf president, was also circumspect: "We've worked on this for 18 months. It's a pretty creative contract. It has a lot of aspects to it, but the effort was worth it. It's not often you get a chance to work with somebody who's the best in the world at what they do. Working with and being associated with Tiger Woods has created an incredible amount of positive energy about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods has represented \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since turning professional in 1996. In just four years he has raised his game to a level few could have imagined, and attracted a record number of TV viewers along the way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With three tournaments to play, his nine victories this year are the most in one US PGA Tour season since 1950 and he is on course to shattered the all -time season scoring average set by Byron Nelson in 1945.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Earlier this year, Woods - who is still only 24 - signed an endorsement deal with Buick worth pounds 20m over five years and carries its logo on his bag.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MAMBO is negotiating with footware giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to form a distribution alliance in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The anti-establishment leisurewear icon, bought out by Gazal Corp last March, has held talks with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executives visiting Sydney for the Olympic Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gazal managing director Michael Gazal said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alliance was being considered as a means to break into the tough US retail market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We had one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys ring up and ask about it," he said. "It was one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys out here for the Olympics. He visited one of the stores."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Gazal ruled out any sale of Gazal's marketing rights to Mambo in the US. Instead, the two are pursuing a joint venture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They could be a good distribution partner. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would have to be one of the giant trademarks. It is like a mega giant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Obviously, getting into bed with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we will have to weigh up all the issues carefully."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Mr Gazal said he was also considering establishing Mambo in America using internal resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Down the track we may decide we may want to have our own business in the United States. We might send someone from Australia to live there and do it ourselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Another option is a joint venture with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but there are a number of different ways we could do it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Gazal said he was compiling a masterplan to develop a global distribution for Mambo, beginning in the UK and Europe before taking on the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And a float may be in the pipeline, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Gazal said the Mambo purchase in March had transformed Gazal Corp from a brand renter to a global brand owner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a lot different from being an Australian licensee," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are really focusing on the Australian operation, the European operation and getting our international sourcing structure ready to supply world markets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's an exciting time for us. We just have to make sure we have the right business plan and execute it properly."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gazal paid Mambo creator Dare Jennings and his partner Andrew Rich $8.7 million worth of Gazal shares, making them the largest shareholders outside the Gazal family with an 8 percent stake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Jennings remains Mambo's creative director and has taken a seat on the Gazal board.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  however, is reserving the right to pull out of the alliance after six years or alter the amount of its payments if United fails to get into Europe or falls below halfway in the Premiership. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal, due to start when the current deal with Umbro ends in the summer of 2002, means \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will become United's kit supplier and sponsor and gain the worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell all Unitedbranded replica kit, footwear, clothing and equipment .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal means United will receive \'a3133.4 million over the first guaranteed six years of the deal plus 50% of net profits generated by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from merchandising. While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reserves the right to quit the deal after the initial six years, it said over the 13 years United should receive $ 438.5 million or \'a3302.9 million at current exchange rates.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  new deal with the world's No. 1 golfer could be finalized
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 as early as today. It has been predicted that Woods might someday
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 become sports' first $ 1 billion man.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Neither Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, nor IMG's Mark Steinberg,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the golfer's agent, would discuss details. Other sources close
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to the negotiations put the figure at roughly $ 100 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I would assume it's one of the largest contracts in sports marketing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 history," Steinberg said. "It's been in the works for a long
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 time."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Steinberg added that the contract fairly compensates Woods, not
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 just for what he's done for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but for golf in particular and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 sports generally.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In terms of golf, if it's not the No. 1 deal ever done, I'm
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 not aware of a bigger or better one for everybody," Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Whatever he's making from us, he's worth it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The contract starts in one year, when the old one expires. Woods
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 signed his first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal in 1996 for an estimated $ 40 million
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The one major difference between the new and old contracts is
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 that Woods now is contractually bound to play the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Precision
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tour Accuracy Ball. He's been using a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball, without a contract,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 since the Deutsche Bank Open that he won in May.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In advertising parlance, Woods is a head-to-toe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  man. He wears
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  footwear, clothing, gloves and hats. And now uses the ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The contract includes everything but clubs and the bag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods, 24, who has endorsement deals with 11 companies, has won
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 nine tournaments this year, the most on the PGA Tour since 1950.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The wins include three major championships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Tiger is very, very significant for us as a company, not just
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 as a golf company," Wood said. "That is taken into account in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the new deal."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the 100 metres gold medallist, Maurice Greene, flung his flashy shoes into the crowd on Saturday night, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legion of marketing executives who have descended on Sydney couldn't have wished for a better publicity stunt. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not since Michael Johnson's gold runners at Atlanta has a pair of shoes attracted so much attention. And shoes that attract publicity are catching on among other athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marion Jones has been sporting a silver pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nikes\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Sydney. Cathy Freeman has her yellow, black and red \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nikes\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the equivalent of the Aboriginal flag on her feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it was Greene's shoes covered in the United States stars and stripes, with goldplated soles and spikes which have been attracting the headlines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They were specially created for Greene and carry \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "swoosh" trademark in bright red perfect for television cameras and newspaper photographers to focus on.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The move was yet another attempt by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to stake out its Olympic territory. The sportswear giant paid $8 million in December to become an official sponsor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it faces stiff competition from archrivals Reebok and adidas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adidas is spending $8 million on an intensive television advertising campaign during the Olympics. While the company is not an official sponsor of the Sydney Games, its marketing director, Mr Rob Mills, said there was nothing stopping it from using the Olympics to increase the brand's exposure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Consumers love the Olympics because it's a fantastic celebration of sports," he said. "We make a lot of equipment which is used in the events held during the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is a tremendous upsurge of interest in sport during the Olympics; the exposure you can generate for your brand during this time is enormous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have a legitimate right to talk about our commitment to sport and athletes. We are not breaking any rules or regulations. We're not ambush marketing. But at the same time we aren't going to sit on our hands during a major sporting event."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adidas has taken over the exclusive Shore school during the Games. It has become the company's hospitality and media centre for the many athletes it sponsors around the world. When one of them does well adidas holds press conferences in its own media centre in an effort to make the media pick up on its "branding" activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Greene, hurling his shoe into the crowd was all about giving something back to the fans for their support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You know the fans here are so great ... I was just overwhelmed with them greeting me the way they did," the world's fastest man said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I wanted to give them something because me giving them the show wasn't enough, so I gave them my shoe."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Greene quipped that he might want the shoe back from Ben Harper, a 20yearold Wagga jeweller, when told it could be valued at $US100,000 ($186,567).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If it's worth that much then I think I want it back," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Manchester United have agreed a world-record kit deal with the sportswear company \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that will earn the Premiership champions pounds 300m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The 15-year deal, to be announced on Monday, will eclipse any other in the football industry. It is due to start when Umbro's current contract expires in two years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It will be worth an estimated pounds 20m a year, easily beating the current world-record kit deal between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Brazilian Football Federation. That 10-year agreement is worth about pounds 7m a year to Brazil and covers all the country's national teams, including junior and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has taken the dramatic step in a move to gain a stranglehold of the world football business after seeing the basketball market fall. The retirement two years ago of Michael Jordan, who helped make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name and fortune, hit the company hard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had already forged close links with United, most notably through its endorsement of Eric Cantona. The current United players Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Paul Scholes are all kitted out in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company has spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson about him adopting a role as a part-time "ambassador" for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when he retires. A furious process of tender has been going on in secrecy at Old Trafford for several months and a plc deputation also visited \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  world headquarters in Oregon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Beckham last night denied allegations that he spat towards the German referee Markus Merk near the end of United's 3-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match on Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although he did not deny spitting, he was adamant it was not at the official. "I did not spit at the referee at all," he said. "Things happen, you react and get headlines for it. But sometimes it looks worse than it actually is."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merk, who later booked the midfielder for dissent, apparently failed to spot the spitting incident. The likelihood, therefore, is that it was not included in his match report and that Uefa will not deem it necessary to consider disciplinary measures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Emmanuel Petit last night insisted he had no intention of leaving Barcelona despite reports in the Spanish press that Barca have asked his agents to find the former Arsenal player another club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Petit has been a peripheral figure in his first two months at the Nou Camp, having failed to impress the coaching staff, and Mundo Deportivo reported that Chelsea were among a host of clubs alerted to his possible availability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I've spoken to Jose Mari Bakero (the assistant coach) and he has told me there is nothing in this story," responded Petit. "I'll do everything to stay here and be successful. I'm not a quitter."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Petit signed for Barcelona for pounds 9m during the summer but has started only one game since the Spanish league got under way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mark Kennedy and Phil Babb learned last night that they will not play for the Republic of Ireland until they have answered court charges of drunken behaviour and criminal damage. They are due in court on November 13.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Kennedy, of Manchester City, and Babb, of Sporting Lisbon, were sent home after being arrested last month in Dublin by an off-duty policewoman for allegedly jumping on her car after a drinking session in the build-up to the Republic's Group Two game in the Netherlands.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Sports gear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said Thursday it had extended its marketing deal with the world's best golfer, Tiger Woods, for another five years in one of the biggest endorsement packages ever.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf President Bob Wood declined to confirm reports that the deal would pay Woods $100 million, but the contract is worth far more than Woods' current five-year deal, which had been estimated at $40 million. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Did he get a big raise? Yes he did, and he's worth every penny of it,'' Wood said in a telephone interview.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's definitely right up there, if it's not the largest. I haven't seen one bigger than this, and I've been at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for 25 years,'' Wood added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like retired basketball legend Michael Jordan, Woods gets more money as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sales exceed contract targets, potentially adding millions to his bank account.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Michael's deal had upside. This deal has upside, too,'' Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods endorses a range of golf-related gear and clothing, including hats, shoes, gloves and shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new deal runs from Sept. 1, 2001 until Sept. 1, 2006 --when his current contract expires. Woods and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also signed an addendum to the current deal that will pay him more money to endorse \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  new line of golf balls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has been hitting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls in tournaments since May 1, coinciding with his red hot performance on the links and a surge in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  market share, Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Much of what we've done in the golf business so far can be directly attributed to Tiger. We've gone from zero to four percent market share in golf balls in just a few months.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods this week won the $3.1 million Canadian Open, becoming only the second player in history to win the U.S., British and Canadian Opens in the same year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some things are true even though Phil Knight, the chairman of  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , believes them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight recently made news for suddenly withdrawing a  contemplated $ 30 million gift to the University of Oregon after  the university balked at joining a coalition - the Fair Labor  Association - that was formed by human rights groups, colleges,  the U.S. government and companies such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to alleviate global  sweatshop conditions. Oregon opted to join an alternative group  being pushed on college campuses, the Worker Rights Consortium,  which also plans to combat sweatshops, but refuses to cooperate  with any companies, such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The natural assumption is that Knight is wrong. The truth is,  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a shameful past when it comes to tolerating sweatshops.  But on the question of how best to remedy those conditions - which  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has now agreed to do - Knight is dead right and Oregon wrong:  The best way to create global governance when there is no global  government is to build coalitions, in which enlightened companies,  consumers and social activists together forge their own rules and  enforcement mechanisms. That's what the FLA represents and it's  what the WRC doesn't. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We've heard plenty this year about the downsides of  globalization. The question is what to do about it. The more  radical protesters, such as the WRC, want to trash multinationals  and get the World Trade Organization to set rules for workers and  the environment, not just for trade. And what practical effect  have the protesters had so far? Zero.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So what to do? Well, it comes down to this: Do you want a  make a point or do you want to make a difference? The FLA was  formed to make a difference. The WRC was formed to make a point.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FLA was forged four years ago, and it now includes the  Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the National Council of  Churches, the International Labor Rights Fund, 135 universities  and major apparel companies. After long talks, this diverse group  agreed on a nine-point code for any apparel factory anywhere in  the world - including rules against forced labor and child labor,  as well as freedom of association, minimum wages, maximum working  hours, lighting and safety. They also agreed on a system of  independent monitoring, surprise inspections and followups, which  is now being tested in five developing countries.   Companies  whose factories comply will be able to sew an 'FLA' label into  their clothing, and the 135 universities have agreed that their  logos will go only on FLA-made products. Global brands can't  afford any longer to be associated with sweatshops, and the FLA  creates a credible system for empowering consumers to punish dirty  companies and reward improving ones.  The WRC, by contrast, is  backed by protectionist U.S. unions, such as Unite, that don't  want any system that would give a stamp of approval to any  production outside the United States. That's one reason the WRC  won't work with companies. But that means the WRC has no way of  consistently monitoring factories or following up remedies, and it  is only focused on clothing sold on college campuses.   It's good  that there's a WRC out there noisily protesting sweatshops and  embarrassing companies. But the WRC is not a substitute for the  FLA, which has a comprehensive strategy for upgrading the whole  apparel industry. It's a pity that some cowardly college  presidents - intimidated by a few vocal and often uninformed  students - have quit the FLA in favor of the WRC. 'We need to make  these companies our allies, not our opponents,' said Sam Brown,  the 1960s antiwar activist, former U.S. ambassador and now  director of the FLA. 'We won't change the world overnight. But it  is foolish to dismiss the FLA because it does not go far enough or  fast enough. The issue is how to get from here to there, and the  FLA has a real strategy for harnessing U.S. consumer power to  change the lives and working conditions of real people.'Thomas L.  Friedman, a two-time Pulitzer winner, writes for The New York Times.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What are some of the hippest brands of jeans these days? If you're thinking of obscure names and high price tags, think again. Think Levi's. Yes, Levi's. And Sergio Valente. Some of the biggest of the big brands are back, it seems. And not just in the world of jeans. So before you clean out your closet for the new year, take a look at this list of brands that have become cool again among the trendy. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like any crush, our love affair with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had to end. It seemed that no matter how much we paid for the shoes, no matter how well-coordinated our outfits, we were never quite the performance athletes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wanted us to be. We grew tired of "just doing it." We needed a rest.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  popularity was initially eroded by brands such as Airwalks and Vans. Then Adidas' stripes began appearing everywhere. Even New Balance and Saucony had their moments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yet just as mainstream Americans seemed about to banish \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trendsetters -- those hip, forward-thinking individuals who often set the pace for others -- began returning to the brand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * LEVI'S
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A few years ago, Levi's could do no right. Their product was staid, their ads inconsistent and often bizarre. And they somehow managed to miss completely the fact that wide jeans and hip-hop clothing were the biggest things to hit teens since rock 'n' roll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But while everyone was rushing out to buy Tommy, Abercrombie and Polo, the Levi's elves were hard at work. They began to build on the brand's popularity abroad, marketing their best products in Europe and importing their European advertising success to the States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Soon trendsetters across America began clamoring for the Levi's Equipment for Legs line: high-tech, all-weather pants that allow the wearer to do a lot -- and look cool doing it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * MARITHE & FRANCOIS GIRBAUD and SERGIO VALENTE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These two brands, which seemed to have been sentenced to life in fad prison, have suddenly been paroled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marithe & Francois Girbaud is back for good behavior. The brand has reinvented itself; today it features stylish little nylon jackets and utility skirts similar to those from other hip labels such as 555 Soul. Now known only as "Girbaud," the clothing line is hot among trendy teens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sergio Valente, on the other hand, is back for time served. In the '80s, the classic sexpot line of jeans was known for its tight look and steerhead logo. Today's tight Sergios remind us of all that we miss from the fun-filled '80s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * SWATCH
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Tag Heuer, Spoon and a series of other watch brands are dazzling consumers with more features than an iMac, the simple Swatch -- the poor-man's Rolex of the '80s -- has quietly been rediscovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The designs have gotten cooler, and the price makes them almost disposable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a world where individualism is everything, Swatch offers a watch for your every mood, outfit or hairstyle.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sneaker giant, along with Vogue and GQ magazines, will take over the Delegates Dining Room at the United Nations to present the new designs, which will be worn by athletes from 17 different countries. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will make exclusive designs for the U.S. track and field, rowing, softball and women's volleyball teams.It will also design athletic apparel for teams from China, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and the Netherlands, among others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Olympics could not come at a better time for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In February, the Beaverton, Ore.-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw its shares plunge 19 percent after the company warned that retailers' plans to close hundreds of sporting-goods stores would hurt the athletic-shoe-maker's earnings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On top of the store shutdowns, sales fell 8.1 percent last year as consumers switched to dressier styles, favoring hiking boots and khaki pants over the sweatpants-and-running-shoes look.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To combat the loss, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  announced last month that it would form a new high-tech electronics division, pumping out items such as portable audioplayers, heart-rate monitors and two-way radios to be introduced by the holiday shopping season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has definitely made a strong push into new categories," said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment Corp.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The sneaker business has always been tough because it's subject to fashion whims that change with the wind."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Taylor said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still the leading sneaker manufacturer but is now looking to build its apparel and accessories businesses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still the dominant name in sports. It's a smart idea to identify themselves with winners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And the Olympics is a wonderful forum. It's the most visible way to get the swoosh out there."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokeswoman for the company that makes the basketball sneakers once worn by living-legend Michael Jordan and the outfits worn by tennis great Andre Agassi said, "The apparel business is a growing business for us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the Olympics "helps us to reinforce our innovation message," and "being associated with great athletes provides us with the opportunity to create the best product."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman's Swiftsuit may become a retail product as sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prepares to cash in on her victory in the 400m final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing team were ecstatic with Freeman's decision to don the hi-tech suit, that uses aerodynamics and heat-sensored fabrics to boost performance, which is only available to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -sponsored athletes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Less than 12 hours after her medal victory, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  launched an advertising campaign on bus shelters around Sydney and Melbourne covered in pictures of Freeman wearing the suit and carrying such slogans as "Change the world 400 metres at a time" and "Official supplier of joy to the Games".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had pre-prepared a television commercial featuring Freeman that screened within minutes of her victory on Monday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although heavily sponsored by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Freeman made no commitment to wear the suit in the final after opting not to use it earlier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But her coach, Peter Fortune, said she decided three days before the final to wear it in the big race and he believed it gave her a psychological advantage over her track rivals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Megan Ryan said plans to market the suit to the public had not yet been confirmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman's win would have triggered six-figure performance bonuses from sponsors like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Optus and Qantas -- all keen to re-sign Freeman when existing contracts expire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She also has smaller sponsorship deals with Coles Myer and News Ltd but the total bonus payments from Monday night's victory could be as high as $800,000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Born: January 2, 1911
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Died: December 25, 1999
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  BILL Bowerman was the co-founder of one of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   With Phil Knight, Mr Bowerman founded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the company made famous by basketball superstar Michael Jordan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr Bowerman was a track coach at the University of Oregon when he met Phil Knight, a former runner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Seeking to develop an athletic shoe that was lighter and had more traction, they came up with a new type of footwear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr Bowerman designed waffle-soled shoes and, buoyed by a boom in physical fitness and running in the 1970s, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was built into the largest athletic shoe and sports apparel maker in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was based at Beaverton in Oregon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   It was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signing of young basketball superstar Michael Jordan that helped turn the company into a multi-billion dollar venture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr Bowerman was an Oregon boy through and through.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   He was born in Portland and raised in Fossil and Medford.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr Bowerman spent 24 years at the University of Oregon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Before coaching at Oregon, he competed in track events and played football for the university.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   During his time Mr Bowerman won four NCAA track and field championships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   He served a coaching apprenticeship in a high school at Medford.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   In 1949 he was named head track coach at Oregon University.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   He coached 44 all-Americans and 19 Olympians at the university.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   In 1964 Bowerman went into business with Knight, each investing $500.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The company is now worth more than $21 billion.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Matt Gogel reached into the pocket of his black slacks and produced a note, a message left for him in the Pebble Beach pro shop Monday morning from a friend he met in Kansas City, Mo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You are ready to win . . . " the note read. "Good luck, George Brett."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brett, the former Kansas City Royals star, was half right. Gogel, a 28-year-old PGA Tour rookie who won six tournaments on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour (now the Buy.com Tour), might have been ready to win. But he was wholly unprepared for the Tiger Woods tornado. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour ran headlong into Mr. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who overcame a seven-stroke deficit with seven holes to play, then held on to collect his sixth consecutive victory. Gogel was asked if there is a feeling of destiny about what Woods has done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't know about destiny," he said. "He's just damn good. He won the golf tournament. He had all eyes on him. The press was following the story all week; and he is the story."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's not the way Monday started. Gogel, who began the day as a co-leader with Mark Brooks at 12 under, made birdies on five of the first seven holes and, by his estimation, was playing the best golf of his life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He made a four-foot birdie putt on the first hole, a seven-footer on the second and a 15-footer on the third. After picking up pars on Nos. 4 and 5, he birdied 6 and 7.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His 31 on the front nine was, quite simply, smoking.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Everybody who's ever covered this tournament -- whether it's the U.S. Open or the AT&T -- knows you score on the holes going out (on the front nine)," Gogel said. "You score on holes 1 through 7. And 8, 9, 10, you kind of hold on and par is a good score. Then, 11 through 18, you try to hit good shots and take what you can get. But it's a tough test coming home, and it got me today."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For Gogel, the trouble started on No. 11, a 380-yard par 4. His approach shot was long, landing in a greenside bunker. He blasted out of the sand and missed a short par putt. That bogey left him at 16 under, five shots ahead of Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not long after that, Woods, who was three groups ahead, holed out a wedge from 97 yards to move to 13 under. He finished with birdies on two of the last three holes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I didn't know he made eagle until I was on the 18th green and saw the hole-by-hole," said Gogel, who could not recall hearing the roar of the gallery when Woods made his marvelous wedge shot on 15. "I heard a couple ofloud noises. I'm assuming he birdied 18 (which Woods did) because I did hear a loud ovation about 30 minutes before I finished."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After every hole, Blair Gogel would nervously dial both sets of parents on a cellular phone and give them a shot-by-shot update. On one hole, she walked over to a house that lines the fairway, stood under a carport and made a call.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "She's been my biggest supporter," Gogel said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Woods finished with a birdie, that left Gogel one shot off the lead and needing to birdie 17 or 18. He had chances on both.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If Matt plays well coming in, makes a birdie here and there, it's over," Woods said. "I needed to keep pushing, keep making birdies and make it interesting."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That it was. Gogel nearly drained an 18-foot putt on 17, missing by the width of the ball. He came so close, he dropped to a squatting position and softly clapped his hands in frustration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On No. 18, he teed off with a 3-wood and took conservative aim for a spot on the far right side, steering clear of the sea wall along the left. He landed in the rough and hit his second shot to within 100 yards of the green. Finally, he made a beautiful approach shot over the front bunker to 10 feet below the cup. He missed -- handing victory to Woods -- and wound up three-putting to card a 40 on the back nine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Composed yet looking dazed, Gogel walked to the scorers' trailer with his wife's arm draped over his shoulder. In the trailer, Woods offered a few words of encouragement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I didn't realize it was Tiger," said Gogel, who never looked up from his scorecard. "My wife said Tiger came in and said, 'You have a lot to be proud of.' . . . It was a classy act. It was very classy for him to do that. Certainly, I thought he would be out on the green for the trophy presentation, so I didn't realize it was Tiger. It says a lot about who he is."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the rest of the golf world is finding out a little more about Gogel, who attended the University of Kansas, won $180,173 on the Buy.com Tour last year and counts Brett among his friends. Two weeks ago at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Gogel played in the final group Sunday and was a shot out of the lead with one round to play. He shot a 71 to tie for seventh, five shots behind winner Jesper Parnevik.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have no doubt whether or not I'm good enough (to win), but until you get the first one you are always going to wonder when it will come," said Gogel, who finished tied for second with Vijay Singh and collected a $352,000 paycheck. "So I will do the exact same thing next time and, hopefully, it's soon that I'm back in a position to win a golf tournament."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MAMBO is negotiating with footwear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to form a distribution alliance in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The anti-establishment leisurewear icon, bought out by Gazal Corporation last March, has held talks with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executives visiting Sydney for the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gazal managing director Michael Gazal said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alliance was being considered as a means to break into the tough US retail market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We had one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys ring up and ask about it," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It was one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys out here for the Olympics. He visited one of the stores."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal ruled out any sale of Gazal's marketing rights to Mambo in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Instead, the two are pursuing a joint venture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They could be a good distribution partner," Mr Gazal said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would have to be one of the giant trademarks. It is like a mega giant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Obviously, getting into bed with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we will have to weigh up all the issues carefully."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, Mr Gazal said he was also considering establishing Mambo in the United States using internal resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Down the track we may decide we want to have our own business in the United States. We might send someone from Australia to live there and do it ourselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Another option is a joint venture with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but there are a number of different ways we could do it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal said he was compiling a master plan to develop global distribution for Mambo, beginning in Britain and Europe before taking on the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And a float may be in the pipeline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "A float is possible," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Depending on what shape the business takes over the next couple of years and what sort of funding is required to be able to achieve the sort of growth that the brand needs, we could float.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "But nothing is imminent. It's probably three to five years away."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal said the Mambo purchase in March had transformed Gazal Corp from a brand renter to a global brand owner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a lot different from being an Australian licensee," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are really focusing on the Australian operation, the European operation and getting our international sourcing structure ready to supply world markets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's an exciting time for us. We just have to make sure we have the right business plan and execute it properly."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gazal paid Mambo creator Dare Jennings and his partner Andrew Rich $8.7 million in Gazal shares, making them the largest shareholders outside the Gazal family with an 8 per cent stake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Jennings remains Mambo's creative director and has taken a seat on the Gazal board.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AUSTRALIA'S Paralympians should push to replace \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as their sportswear supplier in response to a degrading advertisement about the disabled, one of the country's leading disability sports groups said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Wheelchair Sports Australia chairman Michael Godfrey-Roberts foreshadowed a consumer backlash against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and said the team should dump the company if another manufacturer offered to step in. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But he acknowledged that finding a replacement would be tough and praised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overall record of supporting disabled sport in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Godfrey-Roberts was commenting on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisement describing disabled people as drooling, misshapen husks roaming the Earth in motorised wheelchairs. The advertisement appeared in several US outdoor magazines available in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If we were in a fortunate position to be able to make a choice, I have a feeling they would be saying: 'Thank you very much, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We are going to a competitor, they are nicer people,"' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Disability groups and federal politicians yesterday joined the growing international chorus condemning the clothing giant.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Opposition sports spokeswoman Kate Lundy agreed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should consider such a funding gesture.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Manchester United last night confirmed their status as the biggest football club in the world with the announcement of a huge sponsorship deal with sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth an incredible \'a3302.9m over 13 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The "strategic alliance", which starts in August 2002, makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official sponsors and hands them worldwide rights to all United merchandise and global retail operations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal could be even more lucrative to United, who will get half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  net profits generated from the licensing and retail operations providing they stay in the top half of the Premiership and play in Europe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To put the deal into perspective, it works out at \'a323.3m a year for United and the total is more than a quarter of the \'a31.1bn Sky are paying all the Premiership clubs for live TV rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It dwarfs the \'a330m four-year shirt sponsorship deal United announced with Vodafone - then a record - and the only comparable arrangement is the sponsorship deal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have with the Brazilian national side.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will set up a subsidiary to control the global operation, each appointing half the directors. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will appoint the chairman, who will have the casting vote, and the sportswear giants will also have the option to terminate the deal after six years if they should wish.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United's statement said the club intend to use the revenue for "general corporate purposes" - meaning some of the money will be available for buying players.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Germany's consumer protection office says the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer jerseys that were pulled from store shelves last week after reports they contained a dangerous chemical do not present any health hazards. At the same time, the office said the chemical, tributyltin, or TBT, which was used in the shirts to reduce odors from sweating, should be banned. Over the years TBT has been used for anti-barnacle paint on the hulls of ships, but British and Dutch tests have shown it causes mutations in marine snails, and the World Wildlife Fund wants a global ban.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER United are poised to announce a pounds 300million kit deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The American sportswear giants are believed to have agreed a 15-year link-up with the Premiership champions that could be rubber-stamped as early as next week. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United still have two years left to run on their current contract with Umbro, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are determined to establish themselves as the leading force in the world-wide football market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The firm already sponsor Brazil's national team to the tune of just under pounds 7million-a-year for the rights to produce the famous yellow shirts of the four-times World Cup winners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And they now want to tie up a similar agreement with the world's most famous club side.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  already have strong links with the Old Trafford giants, with Andy Cole, Paul Scholes and Dwight Yorke all wearing their boots.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy balls but really uses custom-made balls. I would like to know if other golfers are able to use that same \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball or whether that is made exclusively for Tiger. If only he uses it, does he have an advantage over other golfers?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gardner Counselman
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sun City Center
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Since Woods started using the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball in May, his have been made especially for him with a cover that is a bit harder than the regular \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball. The company got into trouble over this because it claimed Woods was using a ball that is being sold to the public when it was not. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , however, has plans to market the same ball soon. As for whether Woods has an advantage, that is debatable. That golf ball would not necessarily help another player. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Said Woods: "There are a lot of different things that we tinker around with that the general public doesn't have access to. We have clubs and balls that are not on the market. I don't think the general public would really see that much of a difference."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: Why do some pros have customized golf balls? I can see customized clubs. But a golf ball should be like a baseball or a softball. They should be the same.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dave McAlpine
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 St. Petersburg
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Golf balls do have standards, such as a uniform diameter of 1.68 inches. But other things about balls are allowed to differ, such as the hardness of the cover or the way the core is constructed. And to the proficient player, those differences are large, because they might affect the way the ball spins or its trajectory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: Whatever happened to Martha Nause? She was on the LPGA Tour for about 20 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jack Hines
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Seminole
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Nause, 46, who began her career in 1978 and won three LPGA Tour titles, is no longer playing the tour full time. She has played in just three events this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: Do the players have to pay an entrance fee to play in pro tournaments?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Norman Young
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 St. Petersburg
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Senior PGA Tour and Buy.com Tour players pay $ 100 to enter each tournament. PGA Tour players no longer pay an entry fee. LPGA Tour players have a percentage of their earnings deducted each week that in essence is an entry fee.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: When you're playing a shot after it stops on a cart path, my understanding is that you drop at the point of nearest relief. If it's left of the center line, you drop on the left side of the cart path, etc. Would it matter if you are a left-handed or right-handed golfer? I'd like you to clarify.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken Pointer
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sun City Center
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Yes, it does matter if you are a lefty or a righty, because you must drop at the nearest point of relief - not to the side of the cart path that is closest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Rule 24-2, which deals with immovable obstructions, a player should "drop it within one club length of (the cart path) not nearer the hole," but at a point where the obstruction, or cart path, does not interfere with the swing. If one club length requires you to still stand on the cart path, then the nearest point of relief might be the other side of the path.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: A few years ago, there was a young man who won the U.S. Amateur whose name was Patton. I just wondered what happened to him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Russell Rowe
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Port Richey
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: The player you are thinking of is Chris Patton, who won the 1990 U.S. Amateur. Patton has spent the last several years bouncing around the various mini-tours and the Buy.com Tour and has not made it to the PGA Tour. This year, he finished 18th on the TearDrop Tour money list with $ 15,305.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: Several courses in the area have yardage computers on carts. I thought using artificial devices for yardages is a breach of the rules. Are players disqualified for using them?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bob Tait
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clearwater
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Range-finders or computerized devices to determine yardage are not allowed in competition. Typically, for competitions that allow the use of golf carts, the devices are turned off. Their purpose is typically for the enjoyment of casual players and to help speed play.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Q: How do you keep from hitting the ball "fat," in other words behind the ball?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Arnie Becker
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bayonet Point
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: There are several reasons why a golfer would hit the ball "fat," according to Ned Hall, the teaching pro at Clearwater Country Club. "The first thing I would do is bring the ball position back in your stance," Hall said. "Without seeing what is wrong, that might be a good start. Then work on taking the club halfway back and halfway through. The club could be collapsing at the top, and hitting behind the ball is often the result. So tighten up the swing, take half swings, and build it back up. Many times when we hit it fat, it's because we are overswinging."

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  posted audits of its North American factories on its Web site yesterday as part of the athletic shoe and clothing maker's efforts to show it is working to improve conditions and guard labour rights around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Calling the effort Transparency 101, the site lists information about 53 factories that PricewaterhouseCoopers audited in the past year, summarizing problems auditors found in 14 categories. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The largest problem appeared to be health and safety standards. The auditors found that 24 U.S. factories and eight Mexican factories under contract to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not fully comply with company standards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PricewaterhouseCoopers also found 22 U.S. factories, four Mexican factories and a Canadian plant had problems properly documenting workers and making inspections.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beaverton-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is giving each factory an "action plan" to correct problems, and then will conduct follow-up inspections to ensure compliance, said Cheryl McCants, a company spokeswoman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Factories that fail to meet standards will receive warnings, and could even lose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contracts, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our intention is not to take business away, or to have people lose their jobs," McCants said. "But we want them to adhere to the plan. If they're not able to comply, we may have to start doing business elsewhere."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The factory locations are not listed, but the Web site offers a more detailed audit for one location that is representative of each nation's factories.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Bo Diddley thinks \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't know squat about keeping promises.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 71-year-old rock-'n'-roller sued the athletic gear company yesterday, charging it used his name and image on T-shirts without permission. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shirts show Diddley's likeness and the slogan, "You Don't Know Diddley."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guitar player, whose original style has been imitated by hundreds of musicians through the years, agreed in 1989 to appear in TV commercials with athlete Bo Jackson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That deal also involved selling the T-shirts and was supposed to last two years, according to legal papers filed in Manhattan Federal Court by Diddley's attorney, John Rosenberg.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contacted Diddley to negotiate a deal to reissue the T-shirts, but it began selling them before an agreement was reached, the suit charges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By February, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had sold nearly 28,000 T-shirts and made more than $200,000, the suit says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Diddley, whose real name is Ellas McDaniel, demands unspecified compensatory damages and at least $500,000 in punitive damages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vada Manager, a senior official at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  called the suit a tactic in a contract dispute.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that before the suit was filed, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had agreed to pay Diddley $10,000 to $15,000, but Diddley apparently didn't think it was enough.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 On a spring day last year, upper East Side Dr. Deborah Faryniarz tripped over her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoelaces and landed hard on the pavement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She got up, brushed herself off and did what any red-blooded American would do - she sued the sneaker company. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday, in a personal injury suit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, the doctor demanded $10 million for pain and suffering, mental anguish and loss of past and future earnings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Faryniarz - who continues to practice orthopedics - says that while jogging, her right shoelace got caught on a tab at the back of her left \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Certitude cross-trainer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She landed on her knees and wrists, causing permanent damage to her wrist that hampered her abilities as a surgeon, said her lawyer, James Kreindler.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For most people, if they trip and fall, it doesn't impact on their careers," Kreindler said. "For Deborah, it does."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The doctor charges \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  knew about the "design flaw" but did nothing about it.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Cheryl McCants said the company hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she could not recall reports of serious problems with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sneakers but observed, "In general, people have problems and sometimes don't tie their shoes properly."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  HE FLEW in from Spain by private jet, charmed a crowd of 5,000 in Hyde Park, quipped with reporters, reduced a tough lady columnist to knee-trembling ecstasy and immediately flew out again, naturally by private jet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Is there anything the handsome, articulate, diplomatic, supremely gifted, massively rich and just 24-year-old Tiger Woods can do wrong?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Actually, there is. For a start he can stop supporting the absurd notion that golf should be resurrected in the Olympic Games after 96 years. He is only a recent convert to the concept anyway, almost certainly put up to it by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the sports goods manufacturer which not only contributes huge sponsorship to Olympics but also pays Tiger the earth for wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shirts, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hats, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes and hitting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf balls. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Obviously, Tiger displaying all that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gear to the vast global audiences who watch the Olympics but don't normally watch golf on television would add up to one of the smartest free-advertising deals in history. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pays fortunes to its top executives to dream up these coups, but not everyone was born yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So when Matthew Pinsent, one of our rowing heroes from the Sydney Games, briefly hung his Olympic gold medal round Tiger's neck in Hyde Park, Tiger said: 'Wow, I've never touched one of these before,' and, absolutely on cue, lent his super-prestigious name to the pressure group aiming for Olympic golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mercifully, Mr Juan Antonio Sama-ranch, who'd prefer to be addressed as His Excellency, will be out of office by the time a decision is taken. He would have welcomed golf like a shot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This, remember, was the man who in his first year as president of the International Olympic Committee arbitrarily changed all the rules to welcome professional football into the fold and later admitted professional tennis players and basketballers to squash aspiring kids like insects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  By abnegating the trust invested in his high office - the Olympic Games were revived to bring the youth of the world together in friendly competition - he became the lackey of American television corporations paying fortunes to lick his boots while paying for his monarchical lifestyle. Of course, TV would prefer Tiger Woods on screen rather than John Bloggs, a public-course golfer from Wigan, but that is not what the Olympics were designed for.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the one hand Samaranch has professed concern about the accelerating 'gigantism' of the Olympics. On the other he has welcomed the big sports stars who boost TV ratings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professional footballers in the Olympics? Rubbish. They have their own World Cup which is bigger than the Olympics anyway. Professional tennis in the Olympics? Even bigger rubbish. The game has four world championships every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And so it is with golf. Each year it brings to our screens its greatest performers in the U.S. Masters, U.S.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Open and U.S. PGA Championships, and in the Open Championship in Britain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It has enormous exposure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And what would golf in the Olympics do? I will tell you precisely.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It would deprive 30 or so young men and women of the thrill of a lifetime and maybe even a place in the sun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Olympic Games were made for them, not for Tiger Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  i.wooldridge@dailymail.co.uk
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  YEARS AGO, at a time when Sportsmail was giving monthly awards to those who had contributed massively to British sport, we handed over a small trophy to Sir Jack Hayward (above) at a private lunch in Simpson's in The Strand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This was not only to recognise the huge amount of money he had ploughed into Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club but also the enormous sums he had given to protect English tradition and its environment. Sitting down because there were only six of us present and it wasn't a formal occasion, Jack said: 'Do you know, this is one of the happiest events I've ever been to. No-one ever gives me anything because they think I'm so rich I don't need anything.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Well, he needs a great deal more than Wolverhampton's alleged fans gave him the other evening. They booed, catcalled and hissed him for keeping their club alive. They are disgraceful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TOMORROW, I'm going to a lunch at the House of Lords to celebrate the elevation of this girl I've known for years to become Dame of the British Empire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the morning at Buckingham Palace she will receive this award from the Queen and no sportsperson in my life has ever deserved it more. She could, after winning her gold medal at the Munich Olympics in 1972, have pocketed today's equivalent of GBP 1million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Instead, she gave it all away to repair a running track for Protestants and Catholics alike in Belfast.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Arise, Dame Mary Peters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Are these ocean heroes taking one risk too many?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THREE TIMES I have been round the globe reporting round-the-world yacht races in the most cowardly way, by which I mean flying from destination to destination and resting up in comfortable hotels to await the boats coming in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The most harrowing stories were always in either New Zealand or Australia after they'd come through the horrific high seas and shramming cold of the Southern Ocean.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Two dead, I remember, and one amazingly rescued from tumultuous waves at night. If you're not clipped on all the time, your yacht will be speeding away from you and you will have no more than 15 minutes to live before you go under forever.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  My friend, Michael Calvin, is a columnist on our sister paper, The Mail on Sunday, who endured this and somehow, amid all the filth, claustrophobia and danger, contrived to write a series of brilliant articles which rightly won him the Sports Journalist of the Year Award. No-one came within spitting distance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Calvin returned home a changed man. Fools were no longer suffered lightly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He'd acquired a deep cynicism about fellow journalists who reckoned a sour quote from Sir Alex Ferguson, at Manchester United, merited the easy headlines it provoked. He'd been there and done it, which most of us haven't.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I admire Calvin even more for publicly pulling out of The Race, which begins from Barcelona on New Year's Eve and will attempt, with a six-man crew, to rush around the world in 70 days or fewer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'It is not so much that I minded taking the risk,' he said, 'as believing that they're all taking off in a manic rush to satisfy their sponsors.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Calvin's skipper was Pete Goss, captain of the revolutionary Team Philips catamaran which two days ago suffered its fourth gear failure after being launched by the Queen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Goss, lionised for his rescue of a French yachtsman in the Southern Ocean, is an heroic figure. I love yotties for their bravery but I hold my breath about this forthcoming race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Pray God there isn't a disaster.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR maker \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been penalised $15,000 for refusing to supply lists of companies making its clothes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The textile workers' union took \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia to court over its refusals in a bid to ensure the company was not using outworkers to make its apparel. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company agreed to remedy its breaches of the clothing trades award and settled with the union out of court yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The award requires textile companies to list their sub-contractors to encourage accountability and avoid exploitation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union said the settlement spared the company from allegedly embarrassing evidence suggesting outworkers were being used to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This is about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not only keeping to the award conditions but actually paying a penalty for having breached them," state secretary Michele O'Neil said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the company did not use outworkers and ensured none of its suppliers did.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf  Inc.\b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday warned that retailers' plans to close hundreds of sporting goods stores will hurt the athletic shoe maker's earnings this fiscal year and next, sending the company's shares down 19 per cent.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dropped $8.56 (U.S.) to $36.69 in New York Stock Exchange trading. The decline is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  biggest one-day drop in 17 years and erased $2.4-billion in market value. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The profit shortfall is the latest setback for chief executive officer Phil Knight. Sales fell 8.1 per cent last year as people switched to dressier styles and stores cut prices to clear out surplus sneakers, sweatpants and T-shirts. The stock has lost more than half its value since peaking at $76.37 three years ago. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Closets got kind of overpowered with white leather athletic shoes and the market shifted toward more rugged styles in other colours," said Sid Doolittle of the Chicago-based consulting firm McMillan Doolittle. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Venator Group Inc., the largest seller of athletic shoes, has announced plans to close about 150 Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and Champs stores. Just For Feet Inc. is closing about half its 85 locations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also blamed the profit shortfall on the euro, which has fallen 13 per cent against the U.S. dollar in the past 12 months. That hurts the value of European sales when translated into the stronger dollar. About a quarter of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sales are from Europe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Officials with Beaverton, Ore.-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  met with analysts yesterday in New York.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has ordered urgent tests on garments amid claims some of its shirts may be laced with a toxic chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the tests would be conducted "as soon as possible". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They follow German claims a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer shirt contained traces of the toxic chemical tributyltin, or TBT.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chemical is a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships. It can also be used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat. Studies show it causes mutations in marine snails.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  scrapped its contract with a Far East factory yesterday as the Sunday People alerted it that child slave labour was being used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - which has signed a world- record pounds 300million sponsorship deal with Manchester United - insisted it did not know the Cambodian operator was using under-age workers. It cut its links with the June textiles factory as soon as it was told of the scandal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Sunday People had learned of kiddies as young as 12 working for 75p a day in sweatshops. Yvonne Iwaniuk, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  UK's head of corporate communication, said: "We are painfully aware of the situation at theJune factory and have decided to pull out there. We deeply regret what has happened and are doing everything to address the issues that allowed this."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  US-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has now found out about one under-age girl employed at the factory but said she had falsified her papers to get work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Iwaniuk stressed: "We deplore child labour under any circumstances. We just don't tolerate it." United's 15-year deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  starts in 2002 and will net the club pounds 20million a season.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 First it dropped the swoosh. Now global sportswear brand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has announced a radical departure from its traditional footwear and apparel business, revealing plans to launch a range of high-technology gadgets aimed squarely at the health and fitness consumer. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has created a new division, Techlab, to create five new products: a digital audio device, real-time speed-distance and heart rate monitoring devices, a digital compass and a hand-held sport communication product.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The products complement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only existing technology product, its Triax sports watches which were introduced in 1997 and have since sold around 2.5 million units. The new venture is seen as another way of retaining fickle athletic product consumers, whose tastes and demands change almost monthly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dropped the use of its iconic "swoosh" logo for one campaign in an attempt to counter the perception among younger consumers that it had lost its cachet by being over-exposed. That campaign saw it instead adopt the moniker "6453" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  telephone key pad spelling to promote a new shoe among teenagers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company has teamed with Californian technology group S3 Inc to produce the digital audio player, which will be released in the United States in July with a $US299 ($510) price tag. The product will play up to 120 minutes of digital quality music such as MP3 files and Windows Media audio files with 64 megabytes of built-in memory.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will also develop content such as tailored music and motivational messages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other four core products are expected to be launched later this year. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Speed Distance Monitor Triax 100 will measure speed and distance through a device that laces onto the user's shoe, while its Heart Rate Monitor Triax 100 uses a chest transmitter.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  All Conditions Ge Ascent Compass combines altitude functions, a compass, weather forecasting and a thermometer in a wrist piece that resembles a sport watch, while its Personal Sport Communications Communicate is a compact two-way radio with a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 3.2-kilometre radius.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has ordered urgent tests on garments amid claims some of its shirts may be laced with a toxic chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the tests -- on soccer shirts and possibly other items -- would be held as soon as possible. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They follow claims on German TV that a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer shirt contained traces of the toxic chemical tributyltin, or TBT.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chemical is a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It can also be used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Studies have shown it causes mutations in marine snails.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The German TV program found traces of the chemical in the black and yellow jersey of 1997 European soccer champions Borussia Dortmund.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  German department stores have pulled the shirts from shelves until the results of further tests are known.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Ryan said the shirts that were the subject of the German report were not available in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the company was investigating a range of garments worldwide to ensure consumers were not at risk.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER UNITED are on the brink of a world record kit deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that will earn the Premiership champions GBP 300million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract, which could be unveiled next week, is due to start when Umbro's sponsorship expires in two seasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal will run for 15 years - in itself a phenomenal arrangement - and industry experts expect its annual value to be around GBP 20m - around GBP 14m a year more than the present six-year contract. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The most lucrative current tie-up, between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Brazilian Football Federation, is worth GBP 70m over 10 years. The American giants lost out to Umbro two years ago when the Football Association signed a GBP 50m, five-year deal with the Manchester-based company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has already forged close links with United, most notably through its endorsement of former Old Traf-ford striker Eric Cantona. Current United stars Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Paul Scholes are all fitted out by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company has also offered Sir Alex Ferguson a role as a part-time 'ambassador' when he retires as United manager in 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Inevitably, the cash infusion will allow United to plunder the transfer market more ambitiously than up until now. It is a timely boost for Ferguson, who was last night accused of undermining United's Champions League campaign through his own arrogance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson left out David Beckham and Ryan Giggs from the team that lost 3-1 to PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday. Dutch striker Arnold Bruggink believes the Old Trafford manager was condescending in selecting a shadow side that saw four other changes from the lineup held 3-3 by Chelsea last Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United suffered their worst European defeat in six years and a frustrated Beckham, a 70th-minute substitute, appeared to spit at the referee, though he insisted the incident appeared worse than it was.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bruggink said: 'When we heard Sir Al ex had left out Beckham and Giggs, United's two special players, we were amazed. I think there was a little arrogance in what Ferguson did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'Our coach, Eric Gerrets, told us:"You must go out and beat them for your own pride.You cannot let the rest of Europe see that United can field a shadow side and beat PSV on their own ground".' Beckham was photographed spitting in the general direction of German referee Markus Merk and was booked seconds later for arguing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But yesterday he maintained: 'I didn't spit at the referee.You react to things and it was a frustrating night for us because we didn't get the rub of the green. But it was blown out of proportion and made to look a lot worse than it was.'

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  There may soon be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brand cosmetics and toiletries in Australian stores as a result of a court ruling yesterday, but they will have nothing to do with the giant American manufacturer of sports wear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A little known Spanish company - little known in Australia, rather than Europe - succeeded in the High Court in having overturned a decision to remove its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brand name from the register of Australian trade marks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lined up against each other were Spain's Campomar Sociedad Limitata and the US-owned \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  International and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campomar and its predecessors have been marketing perfumes since 1940 under the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name. The name remains registered in several major European countries. It registered the name in Australia in 1992 and started trading.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  International's pre decessor registered the name - which both companies had borrowed from the Greek goddess of victory - in Australia in 1975 as applying to sports shoes and uniforms. The range of goods covered by the registration was later expanded but not to include cosmetics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday's ruling means \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  International is precluded from moving into that area of business, an area that arch-rival Adidas is now involved in.  In 1994, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  moved to have Campomar's Australian trade mark registrations expunged by order of the Federal Court. It was, in part, the fact that Campomar's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Sports Fragrance was being sold alongside Adidas's equivalent product that led the Federal Court to conclude the Campomar's use of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name was misleading.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Campomar's success in the High Court does not mean it can re-release its sports fragrance. The court thought restraining the company from using that label had been justified. But it also thought the Federal Court had gone too far in ruling that the company could not use the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name at all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The court did not give Campomar blanket approval to release non-sporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products. It declined, however, to give Campomar free legal advice by telling it what it could and could not legally market in Australia.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS'S victory in the Millennium Open will help the world's number one golfer clinch a new deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth at least \'a366 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \'a3500,000 first prize won by the 24-year-old American sensation at St Andrews is only pocket money compared to the fortune he has already banked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But by completing a Grand Slam of golf's majors, Woods has taken his earnings to another level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The biggest deal will be for wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  'swoosh' emblem on his clothes, shoes, glove and cap, and for using the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods and his representatives from Mark McCormack's International Management Group, are at present negotiating a renewal of the five-year contract worth \'a326m that was signed with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Alastair Johnston, the Scot who is in charge of IMG's worldwide golf activities, said: "There is no secret about the fact that the first five years Tiger had with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a $ 40 million deal. So if you started with that, doubled it, and added some on, you'd be getting close to the new figure."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Besides \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Woods has blue-chip endorsement contracts with American Express, Buick and Rolex. These, and other sponsorships, were reported to have added \'a345m to his bank balance last year. Earnings away from the golf course - Woods takes a personal interest in his portfolio of stocks and shares - easily dwarf his earnings on the fairways and greens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, career prize money totalling \'a320 million means he now rivals retired basketball star Michael Jordan as the sportsman with the highest earning potential.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Johnston said: "I have a view, somewhat speculative but not entirely inaccurate, that Michael Jordan didn't make as much money as people think he did. But I do know, for sure, what Tiger Woods makes to the last penny. If he hasn't passed Michael by now, he's about to very soon."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Others are not so happy about the way Woods now dominates the game. Jack Nicklaus warned today that the public will turn away from the game if one man dominates for too long.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Nicklaus, who won 18 majors, said: "Tiger is good for the game but he has to have challengers for the whole thing to be right.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a bad story if there isn't a challenge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Right now Tiger is the dominant player. Everybody else has thrown up the white flag and surrendered, I don't think there's anybody contending.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Maybe some guy is going to come along and compete against him. If that doesn't happen, the game of golf is going to suffer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After Woods crushed all opposition during the US Open at Pebble Beach last month, Standard Sport revealed how some television executives were nervous that the boom in viewing figures inspired by the world's No 1 ranked player might be reversed if he turned winning into a monotonous exercise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Their fears will hardly have been eased by the way in which Woods turned the 129th Open into a one-horse race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Duval, the world No 2 who led the chase after Woods going into the last day, had been left trailing in the distance long before he crashed to a quadruple bogey eight at the notorious 17th Road Hole.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ernie Els, the Surrey-based South African ranked three in the world, finished tied for second place with Denmark's Thomas Bjorn eight strokes in arrears. Colin Montgomerie, the European No 1 who is fourth in the world rankings, was joint 26th. Lee Westwood, fifth in the world, was 64th.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even Spanish prodigy Sergio Garcia failed to maintain an early tournament challenge and finished 17 strokes behind.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In golf terms, Woods was so far ahead that his win could be compared to Michael Schumacher lapping an entire Grand Prix grid or Pete Sampras winning Wimbledon in straight sets to love.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Els, runner-up to Woods at Pebble Beach, admitted: "I was playing in a different tournament to Tiger. I play the regular Tour event, and he plays his own event."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Manchester United's status as the world's richest club was given further credence last night when they confirmed the details of a (pounds) 302.9 million sterling kit deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 13-year contract will be the most lucrative tie-up in sporting history when it comes into operation in August 2002, replacing United's present Umbro deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The provisional details of the agreement were leaked from Old Trafford last month, prompting a minor setback in negotiations between the two parties and the threat of legal action from Umbro. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal eclipses the previous record contract between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Brazilian team of (pounds) 67 million over 10 years and, as part of the deal, United will also receive 50 per cent of profits from the sale of club merchandise.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been looking at increasing their presence in English football over the last few years, but this is the biggest coup of all after clinching deals with the likes of Arsenal and Leeds United.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal will bring in at least (pounds) 23 million for United each year. Profits on top of the fees will be shared 50/50 by United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Although the agreement runs for 13 years, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an option to call it off in 2008.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  payments will be reduced if the team does not finish in the top half of the Premiership, or does not compete in European competitions, the club said in a statement. Shares in Manchester United, which stopped trading prior to the announcement, had gained one per cent yesterday to 232p. Not such good news for United is that Mark Bosnich will undergo a hernia operation next week which will rule out the out-of-favour goalkeeper for five weeks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alex Ferguson has tipped Steve McClaren to succeed him as Manchester United manager. Ferguson has no doubts that his assistant has all the credentials needed to take over from him when he retires at the end of next season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McClaren, who replaced Brian Kidd as Ferguson's right-hand man in February 1999, has never really been touted for the job before and he was perceived to be lacking in experience.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ferguson said: "Steve has been brilliant since he came here. He has shown a willingness to learn. It is not my decision to make, but I would have thought all the credentials were there for Steve to take the job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The club is in good shape, which I know the chief executive Peter Kenyon regards as one of the most important things. There is a big decision to be taken, which will be made at the right time."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Barnsley have signed the Middlesbrough midfielder Neil Maddison on a month's loan. The 31-year-old is expected to make his debut against Wimbledon at Oakwell. The 29-year-old American goalkeeper Brad Friedel has been granted a work permit, clearing the way for his move from Liverpool to Blackburn Rovers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Celtic and Rangers have been paired together in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup. The Old Firm will square up at Hampden Park in February.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AC Milan have threatened the Italian Football Federation with legal action unless they allow the Serie A side to field all five of their non-EU players after a court judgement in a separate matter on Thursday, the club's website reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The club made the threat in a letter sent to the federation and countersigned by the five players: Ukrainian striker Andriy Schevchenko, Brazilian trio Dida, Serginho and Roque Junior and Croatian Zvonimir Boban.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FREMONT-- It wasn't quite the "Man in the Iron Mask," but Fremont native Brett Sheridan thought being the man behind the mask might be his chance for fame. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That is until the NBC television network pulled the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad featuring a masked and chainsaw-wielding Sheridan chasing Olympic distance runner Suzy Favor Hamilton.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shoe Co. was informed Monday that NBC would discontinue airing the ad based on viewer complaints about its violent nature, thus ending his run on network television.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad, "Horror," was one of a series of three ads to debut during weekend coverage of the Olympic games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sheridan, a 1992 graduate of Fremont Senior High School, said he knew he was onto something big with the commercial, which is a parody of popular horror films such as the "Friday the 13th" and "Halloween" series.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The actor said directors and producers chose him to portray the horror figure for his physical comedy. Even though the ad has been discontinued on NBC during Olympic coverage, Sheridan said it could help his career.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The actor, who lives in California, has been featured in about 12 television and radio commercials in addition to performing stand-up comedy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His mother, Julie Sheridan of Fremont, said she doesn't know what the fuss is about. She likes the commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad will continue to air on the cable network ESPN.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER United have struck one of the world's biggest financial soccer deals with sports kit giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  American-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have agreed to pay United an estimated pounds 300million for an exclusive 15-year deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United are shortly set to announce the tie-up which will begin when their current deal with Umbro runs out in 2002. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Last night \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were taken aback when Mirror Sport spoke to their London head office about the done deal, which will be unveiled within days at a Press conference.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman said: "We've not confirmed it yet. Who told you about this? Was it United?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're waiting to find out the details. We've not been given all the info."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United started a bidding war between rival sports companies which began at pounds 15million-a-year but quickly escalated until rivals to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  realised they could not win.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were desperate to win the contract and made it clear in negotiations with United that they would beat any other offer on the table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sportswear company, which has a pounds 5billion turnover, shattered its own record to complete the deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who already have boot and clothing deals with United stars Andy Cole, Paul Scholes, Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunner Solskjaer, were determined to get United at any cost.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recently signed up the Brazilian FA in a staggering 10-year deal worth pounds 64.4m that covers every national team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But that is still way short of what United will receive for allowing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to put their distinctive 'tick' logo on the millions of famous red and white strips sold around the world each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which also has top sporting figures on its books like Michael Jordan, Ronaldo and Michael Johnson, have made no secret of their desire for world domination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United were top of its "must have" list.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are also head hunting United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to become their football ambassador on around pounds 1m-a-year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTS giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is designing a disposable running shoe that could be used at the Sydney Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ultra-lightweight shoe can only be worn once and will be limited to sprinters contesting the 100 and 200 metre events.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Testing of the shoe is due to be finalised in June, along with space-age running uniforms for the Sydney Games. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The project could revolutionise the traditional running shoe, which often has to be worn-in by elite athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  designers in the United States believe the disposable shoe could be moulded around the feet and almost peeled off after the event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is believed athletes sponsored by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including Australia's Cathy Freeman, will be asked to trial the shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman is already involved in a separate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  project -- codenamed Swift -- aimed at producing aerodynamic sprinting uniforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  apparel designer Eddy Harber was in Sydney last month to speak to Freeman and measure prevailing wind conditions at Stadium Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Harber, a former body armour designer with the British Army, hopes to come up with a fabric called Lycrapower that would limit muscle vibration during a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has used speed skating body suits as a basis for the design.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The low friction garment would also take body temperature and friction into account and will be tested by Freeman and US sprinters Michael Johnson, Marion Jones and Maurice Greene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It will also be offered to associated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  federations -- and the Australian Olympic team is now incorporated in that," Mr Harber said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took over the production of Australian team gear late last year after Reebok quit its Olympic sponsorship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Australian Olympic Committee officials are expected to be briefed on Project Swift later this month when a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  team visits Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The space age uniforms would be worn by sprinters, hurdlers, and long and triple jumpers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Last year Mr Harber's design team came up with a relay glove featuring a glowing orange stripe to indicate where the baton should be placed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The glove contains a sticky palm and has been approved by international athletic officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was offered to Australian relay runners at last year's world track and field titles but they were reluctant to trial it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The AOC now wants to examine the glove.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls, but he really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has acknowledged after being sued in U.S. federal court.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the balls used by Woods, who's one of the longest hitters in golf, have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, said it's common practice to sell the public different products than what the pros use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other leading names in golf say their customers get what their pros endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist, said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a "tweaked" version of a club, he said, a consumer could special order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the Society of Professional Journalists has asked the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio to reject an appeal by Woods in a right-of-publicity suit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Indianapolis-based organization says Woods's appeal threatens First Amendment rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods sued Alabama artist Rick Rush after he painted Woods at the Masters in April 1997 and then sold 250 limited-edition serigraphs and 5,000 smaller lithographs. Woods claims the sale of the paintings violates his trademark and right of publicity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods lost the first round of the suit in April when U.S. district judge Patricia Gaughan threw out the case.

\par \pard 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 33 percent, meeting Wall Street expectations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company said it earned $126 million, or 46 cents a diluted share, compared with $94.4 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Revenue in the period, which ended May 31, increased to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman, Philip Knight, said the company had solid growth outside the United States, where a weak retail industry has cut into sales -- particularly for athletic shoes -- with a string of closings among large retail chains like Venator, the parent of Foot Locker.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Within the U.S., the retail industry continued to struggle," Mr. Knight said. "However, we did see some early signs of progress."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over all, future orders in the United States were down 5 percent while those in Europe increased 11 percent. Orders in the Asia-Pacific regions were up 21 percent and the region that includes South America increased 13 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the fiscal year ended May 31, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  earnings improved to $579 million, or $2.07 a share, compared with $451 million, or $1.57 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased to $9 billion from $8.8 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shares of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rose $1.125, to $40.1875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company released its results after the close of trading.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also announced plans to buy back $1 billion of stock after the completion of a similar-sized purchase in two years.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AUSTRALIA'S Paralympians should push to replace \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as their sportswear supplier in response to a degrading advertisement about the disabled, one of the country's leading disability sports groups said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Wheelchair Sports Australia chairman Michael Godfrey-Roberts foreshadowed a consumer backlash against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and said the team should dump the company if another manufacturer offered to step in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But he acknowledged that finding a replacement would be tough and praised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overall record of supporting disabled sport in Australia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Godfrey-Roberts was commenting on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisement describing disabled people as drooling, misshapen husks roaming the earth in motorised wheelchairs. The advertisement appeared in several US outdoor magazines available in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If we were in a fortunate position to be able to make a choice, I have a feeling they would be saying: 'Thank you very much, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We are going to a competitor, they are nicer people,"' Mr Godfrey-Roberts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Disability groups and federal politicians yesterday joined the growing international chorus condemning the clothing giant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Democrats leader Meg Lees said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should boost its support of the Paralympic team as compensation for the hurt it had caused.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Senator Lees described the advertisement as "appalling, unconscionable and barely believable".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "An apology is nowhere near good enough," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Opposition sports spokeswoman Kate Lundy agreed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should consider such a gesture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Any extra funding or support that the Paralympians can get out of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a positive thing and they should go for it," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  National Council on Intellectual Disability executive director Mark Pattison said the advertisement was revolting. But he cautioned against punishing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for one blunder, considering the company's history of supporting the disabled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They pulled the ad straight away and gave a reasonable apology," Mr Pattison said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Even though it was appalling and tasteless and out of order, they have responded in a semi-appropriate way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Physical Disability Council of Australia president Maurice Corcoran said the advertisement had damaged 20 years of work by advocacy groups fighting negative attitudes towards the disabled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carolyn Frohmader, from Women With Disabilities, said disability group websites around the world had been flooded with messages expressing outrage over the advertisement.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Duval will quit Titleist and join \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh squad in a deal which will rock the golf industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A five-year, $ 25million deal, which could double with bonuses, has been agreed and is expected to be completed early in the New Year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal will give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  two of the world's top three golfers - a similar-length deal, but double the cost, having already been signed with No 1 Tiger Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The two good friends teamed up recently to win the World Cup for America in Argentina and, significantly, used the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball during the foursomes section of the four-day event. Duval has also been spotted wearing his new sponsor's shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A deal is understood to have been signed at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  head- quarters in Oregon this week, but will not be completed until Duval's existing contract with Titleist is sorted out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It stills has more than two years to run and Titleist, already smarting due to Woods' abdication, could seek compensation from the firm which is fast becoming a serious player in the golf market Titleist have dominated. Duval's switch is expected to increase intensity of that rivalry and extend the boundaries of the golf ball wars which Callaway, another of the industry's big guns, have recently joined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Neither company would comment on the deal yesterday although an announcement is imminent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although Woods still plays a full bag of Titleist clubs, Duval's deal is understood to include clauses which tie him to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once they've manufactured a set to his specifications.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  World No 3 Duval's also expected to sign a new agreement with his management handlers IMG at the start of next year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although Duval's been hampered for most of the season by a back injury, he finished seventh on the PGA Tour rankings with $ 2.4m in prize money.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods signed a five-year endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Thursday that is thought to be worth between $ 85-million and $ 100-million, making it the richest endorsement deal in sports history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The exact worth is hard to estimate because some value is tied to sales and incentives. The new deal begins when Woods' five-year, $ 40-million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expires in September of 2001. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, declined to discuss specifics of the deal, only to say it was an "outstanding contract."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, also refused to reveal specifics, but he was elated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The final details were worked out about 90 minutes ago," Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've been negotiating for about 18 months, but IMG, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Tiger have all been in the same ballpark for a while now," Wood continued. "A lot of people thought we overpaid for Tiger in his original deal, but we don't feel we overpaid for him then, and we don't feel we overpaid for him now. We think it's a fair deal for everybody. He's had a huge impact on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf, and we think that will continue for the next 25 years or more.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A lot of people have compared Tiger to Michael Jordan, but one thing that makes them different is that the career of a professional golfer is so much longer than the career of a basketball player. The earning power of a professional golfer is far greater over the course of a lifetime."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At 24, Woods has won all four major championships, becoming the youngest to complete the career Grand Slam, and he holds the all-time scoring record in all four majors in relation to par. He won three major championships and nine PGA events this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 U.S. MID-AMATEUR: Greg Puga, a 29-year-old caddie at a California club, became the youngest winner in the 20-year history of the event with a 3-and-1 victory over a faltering Wayne Raath at Hot Springs, Va. Puga turns 30 on Oct. 13. The youngest champion was Bill Loeffler, who was 30 years and two months old when he won in 1986. The U.S. Mid-Amateur is for those 25 and older. With his victory, Puga is eligible for next year's Mid-Am, the U.S. Amateur and the Masters. Puga was 2-down after the front nine but caught the 25-year-old South African by making a critical 10-foot par putt on the 10th, birdie on the 11th and a par putt on No. 12 when Raath drove into a lateral hazard. Puga won three of the last four holes with pars, as Raath three-putted the 17th to close out the match at the Homestead's Cascades Course.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If national sympathies toward the monitoring of sweatshops move noticeably in the near future away from aggressive oversight and toward the Kathie Lee Gifford "We Try Hard So Cut Us a Break" approach, let the record reflect the decisive battle waged last week between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Phil Knight and his beloved alma mater, the University of Oregon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight, who has already donated $50 million to the school, said he would hold onto a proposed $30 million donation and not contribute another dime because the university aligned itself with the more aggressive monitoring group, financed by trade unions and allegedly stacked against importers. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which has been the favorite pinata of the aggressive monitoring forces, belongs to a different watchdog group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Word on the Street is that Knight has scored a KO in the testy dust-up. A survey of analysts revealed not a one that thought \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would be harmed by the spat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Knight is standing up for what he believes and people here in Portland, at least the ones I've talked to, are definitely siding with Knight," said Jennifer Black, of Black & Co., based in the heart of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  country. "I don't see any negative fallout from Knight's action."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Shanley, of First Security Van Kasper, concurred. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has reduced the number of factories it contracts with to 30 from 110 last year in order to monitor them better, so I think informed investor won't care about this flap."

This new initiative comes at a time when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is competing against a growing number of new high-end players in the women's athletic market - companies ranging from Tommy Hilfiger Corp., GAP Inc., Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. and fashion houses such as Prada of Italy that are popular with the "GenY" crowd. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it plans to spend two to three times more on its women's business in the next year than it did in the previous year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She says branding, the advertising technique of emphasizing a company logo instead of a product, has sparked a backlash among young people tired of being forced to live in a corporate ''brandscape.'' 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the villains in modern manufacturing, she says, is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ''They don't bother making products anymore,'' she says. ''They farm out the labour overseas instead, choosing to spend the bulk of their money on what they really manufacture: a logo or a brand.''
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  she said, doesn't even sell a product in the conventional sense; they sell an image, or a lifestyle, or an emotion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Well, just a minute ... \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  replies in a stinging response to Ms. Klein's ''self- proclaimed cultural analysis'' posted on its Web site (www.nikebiz.com).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Although the book includes numerous references to Disney Corp., McDonald's and Microsoft, the author spends the most time analysing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing strategies, corporate goodwill activities and manufacturing practices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''In particular,'' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  complained, ''the author dedicates a large portion of the book to an often misinformed, unbalanced evaluation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labour practices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  respects the rights of interested parties to make their opinions known to the general public, it is also important to recognize the complexities of global manufacturing issues and the strides \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has made in this area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''In numerous instances, No Logo diminishes the progress \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has made by dredging up past events, repeating misinformation and often failing to tell the whole story. The book constantly references incidents that occurred in the early 1990s and liberally quotes many of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detractors, yet fails to reference any of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more recent, 'industry-first' labour initiatives.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And what's more, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  adds, ''Ms. Klein never met with any current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labour practices representatives during the writing of this book.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a 1,300-word, point-by-point defence of its North American and overseas operations, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took Ms. Klein to task for disparaging the company's commitment ''to enhance people's lives through sports and fitness.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''At \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we see this as a positive attribute. There is no mistaking that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is passionate about sports and fitness. And when it comes to global manufacturing and trade, we want to be just as clear about what we stand for and what we do.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls in TV and magazine ads, but he really plays with custom-made golf balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged Tuesday after being sued in federal court in San Francisco.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the golf balls used by Woods, who is one of the longest hitters in the game with drives that travel 300-plus yards, have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the golf balls sold to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf marketing director Mike Kelly told the Associated Press.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelly said it is common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros really use. But other leading names in golf said their customers get what their pros endorse. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist, said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a "tweaked" version of a club, he said, a consumer could special-order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are very particular about our advertisements. We don't make any claims that cannot be substantiated in both golf balls and clubs," Gomes said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return a phone call requesting comment on the lawsuit. In the suit, a nonprofit group called Public Remedies Inc. claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , based in Beaverton, Ore., was engaging in unfair business practices. It asks that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "ill-gotten gains" be restored to the public.

The move officially ended a marketing conflict between Woods's top two golf sponsors--\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist--that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the golf ball market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist argued that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was using Woods to promote golf balls because of two commercials--one that showed Woods bouncing a ball off his wedge and another that showed hackers on the range belting 300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked Woods's deal so that he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have its logo on his bag and to use Woods in advertisements.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A showdown over who can offer pizza promotions with the Washington Redskins is in the works.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Redskins are protesting Washington area Domino's pizza stores' offer of a discount on pies for every touchdown the team scores. Frank Meeks, who owns 60 Domino's in the area, said Tuesday the discount is good for every Monday after a Sunday game or the Tuesday following a Monday night game.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But yesterday the team released a statement stating only Papa John's pizza has the right to offer promotions affiliated with the Redskins.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're talking to them [Domino's] about the fact that they're using a promotion developed last year in conjunction with us," Redskins spokesman Karl Swanson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Swanson said the team's agreement with Domino's expired in June and the Redskins have since reached a marketing deal with Papa John's to be the "official pizza" of the team. He added that Domino's pizza no longer will be sold at games in FedEx Field.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Only Papa John's can create and offer a promotion tied to the Washington Redskins," Redskins President Steve Baldacci said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meeks said Domino's outlets from West Virginia to Maryland will offer the promotion again because it was such a success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We started it," Meeks said. "We will continue to do it this year. It's not a Redskins promotion. It's called 'The Domino's Pizza Touchdown Take Off.' "

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So Tiger has made a few quid out of golf then? A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So far, his career earnings are a tidy $ 16,291,560, easily more than anybody has made on the golf course but chickenfeed in the big scheme of things. Last year, he earned $ 47m, including endorsements. His first contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was worth $ 60m alone. Phil Knight, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman, has said that Tiger will always sport the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh. Earl Woods, Tiger's's father, has told Knight that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will have to come up with more money every time his boy puts pen to paper. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What other endorsements does he have?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His second biggest deal is with Titleist, whose clubs he uses. He also endorses American Express, Rolex and Wheaties, but he says money is a bad second to career achievements in his priorities. He prove this by sacking his agent, Hughes Norton. These days, Tiger suits himself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Staggering success, incredible riches must make him a powerful kind of guy?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He came in at No 7 in the latest Forbes Power 100, a list of entertainment and sports personalities headed by Julia Roberts. However, there are signs that he is on the way up the list. Forbes counted 32,974 press articles about Tiger. Roberts, by comparison, was practically snubbed with only 9,978 clippings to her name.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What's this about never missing the cut?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He has made 52 consecutive cuts and he's almost halfway to another record. Byron Nelson made 113 cuts back in the 1940s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Is there any time for a lady in his life?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He now has a steady blonde beau, Joanna Jagoda, right. Before they became an item, he was linked to a series of potential girlfriends, including model Tyra Banks. "I didn't even know I dated them. I don' have a girlfriend. None," he said at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Blossoming romance obviously hasn't put him off his game. Would it be fair to say that he has been successful lately?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He has won of his last 22 PGA Tour events and 16 of his last 29 tournaments overall. He has played in 82 PGA Tour events and won 20 of them (24.4%). He has 34 top-three finishes (41.5%), 43 top-five finishes (52.4%), and 53 top-10 finishes (64.6%).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He seems to hit the ball a mile down the St Andrews fairways. What's the secret of his prodigious length?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sports Illustrated magazine claimed he "comes closer to achieving optimum launch conditions - a combination of swing speed and angle of impact -than any of the more than 300 touring pros Titleist has tested over the last 20 years".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And what is his weapon of choice?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger uses a Titleist Titanium 975D driver with just 7.5 degrees of loft. A club golfer would struggle to get his ball airborne with that. His Titleist three-wood has 13 degrees of loft. He has three wedges in his bag, largely because his drives generally put him so close to the hole.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He covers his driver with a fluffy Tiger. What's all that about?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His mother, Kutilda, made it for him. The words "Love from Mom", in Thai, are stitched on it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Who hands him his clubs on the course?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger's caddie is Steve Williams, who was on Ray Floyd's bag for 12 years and also did a brief tour of duty with Greg Norman. "Steve knows when to say something and when not to say something," he said last week. Tiger's first caddie, Fluff Cowan was sacked. Some people thought he was getting a bit carried away with his celebrity status.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Speaking of celebrities, his coach is a bit of a star too, isn't he?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And charming with it. Butch Harmon is the man, although his real name is Claude. He once played on the US Tour, but he has had far more success as a swing doctor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Q
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Will he be handed the claret jug later today?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Has Colin Montgomerie ever barked at a photographer?

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker, says it plans to spend $2 billion US over two years to quadruple production of flash memory chips to meet soaring demand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chips, which retain data in electronic devices when the power is off, are in heavy demand as sales of cellphones, handheld organizers and other devices increase.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That will lift the number of flash-memory megabytes produced fourfold, said Curt Nichols, general manger of Intel's flash products group.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IBM has reached a deal to build advanced chips for a key line of Compaq Computer Corp.  computers, and separately unveiled new versions of its own mainstay AS/400 business computers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Compaq deal shows IBM is making progress in its bid to become a supplier of components not only for use in its own products, but also those of rival computer makers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While IBM's semiconductor business comprises less than 10 per cent of its nearly $90 billion US in annual revenues, the company's shift to higher margin products should help bolster the company's overall profitability, analysts say.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Companies aligning themselves with the Games must be clever, not crass
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AMBUSH marketing is one of the big naughty words associated with the Olympics. There is a perception that ambush equates with dirty and underhand -- that there is something sordid about the process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The only thing worse than ambush at the Olympics is drugs at the Olympics. It really is that serious. To some, anyway. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But there is also a feeling that any ambush will be huge and obvious.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most of this expectation stems from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experience at Atlanta, which is widely regarded as the benchmark for all ambush efforts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The story of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Atlanta became the business story of the 1996 Games, and the size, nature and sophistication of the ambush has only become bigger in the intervening years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For example \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  booked every billboard in Atlanta during the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For Sydney, the rules have been changed and this would be impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the reality is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the exception and not the rule. Those expecting another company to be as aggressive as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Sydney are likely to be sorely disappointed. Not least because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is now inside the Olympic tent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Any overt ambush marketing is thus unlikely to be on a large scale, not least because the International Olympic Committee is becoming ever more zealous in its protection of sponsor rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And just to clear up how the IOC defines ambush marketing: "Olympic ambush marketing occurs when a company that does not financially support the Olympic movement attempts to present itself as an Olympic marketing partner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This is done through advertising or promotion that is designed to mislead the public."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The IOC refers to this as "parasite activity". Although in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  case, parasites can be rehabilitated -- all it takes is a lot of money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Large-scale ambush marketing action is unlikely to be spotted in Sydney. However, this does not mean many non-Olympic sponsors won't be doing their utmost to be associated with sport in some form or other.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After all, it's basically sound business practice to be associated with an event that is projected to attract a global television audience of more than 20 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It just means that rather than paying for front-row seats, you pay a little less to sit further back in the auditorium, but the important thing is to be in the auditorium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One case study of what smart companies are doing is the marketing program at the Australian Institute of Sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is no coincidence that this year the AIS's sponsorship budget has climbed to a record high of $18 million. The AIS managed to raise $2 million when it started its sponsorship program in 1992.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Companies aligning themselves with the Games must be clever, not crass
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AMBUSH marketing is one of the big naughty words associated with the Olympics. There is a perception that ambush equates with dirty and underhand -- that there is something sordid about the process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The only thing worse than ambush at the Olympics is drugs at the Olympics. It really is that serious. To some, anyway. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But there is also a feeling that any ambush will be huge and obvious.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most of this expectation stems from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experience at Atlanta, which is widely regarded as the benchmark for all ambush efforts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The story of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Atlanta became the business story of the 1996 Games, and the size, nature and sophistication of the ambush has only become bigger in the intervening years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For example \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  booked every billboard in Atlanta during the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For Sydney, the rules have been changed and this would be impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the reality is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the exception and not the rule. Those expecting another company to be as aggressive as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Sydney are likely to be sorely disappointed. Not least because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is now inside the Olympic tent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Any overt ambush marketing is thus unlikely to be on a large scale, not least because the International Olympic Committee is becoming ever more zealous in its protection of sponsor rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And just to clear up how the IOC defines ambush marketing: "Olympic ambush marketing occurs when a company that does not financially support the Olympic movement attempts to present itself as an Olympic marketing partner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This is done through advertising or promotion that is designed to mislead the public."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The IOC refers to this as "parasite activity". Although in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  case, parasites can be rehabilitated -- all it takes is a lot of money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Large-scale ambush marketing action is unlikely to be spotted in Sydney. However, this does not mean many non-Olympic sponsors won't be doing their utmost to be associated with sport in some form or other.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After all, it's basically sound business practice to be associated with an event that is projected to attract a global television audience of more than 20 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It just means that rather than paying for front-row seats, you pay a little less to sit further back in the auditorium, but the important thing is to be in the auditorium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One case study of what smart companies are doing is the marketing program at the Australian Institute of Sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is no coincidence that this year the AIS's sponsorship budget has climbed to a record high of $18 million. The AIS managed to raise $2 million when it started its sponsorship program in 1992.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But what is instructive in the AIS case is not so much the amount of money that has been raised but the nature of the companies involved -- there is nary an Olympic sponsor in sight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even better, most are direct competitors of Olympic sponsors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Among the main sponsors of the AIS are computer giants Microsoft and Compaq, which are both direct competitors to Olympic sponsor IBM.

Bread brand TipTop, owned by Australian Stock Exchange-listed George Weston, is a sponsor, as well as cereal manufacturer Kellogg's, which competes with the Goodman Fielder-owned Uncle Toby's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Soft-drink maker Berri supplies the sport drink Isosport, which is battling for share in that market segment with Coca-Cola's Powerade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Berri also distributes Summit spring water as an AIS-endorsed product, which again goes head-to-head with Coke's Mount Franklin spring water brand.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fresh off his record-breaking summer of golf, Tiger Woods is on the verge of signing a $ 100-million endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be the richest in sports, the Associated Press has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, his agent at IMG, declined to discuss specifics of the deal on Thursday, only to say it was an "outstanding contract."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are within days of a signature," he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but what he has done for golf and sports."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' previous contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was said to be $ 40-million over five years. He was used heavily in their advertisements and established his own line of clothing and shoes.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood described the contract as "pretty creative."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not often you get a chance to work with somebody who's the best in the world at what they do," he said. "Working with and being associated with Tiger Woods has created an incredible amount of positive energy about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Wood also declined to discuss contract details, he did say the amount was partly tied to sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has represented \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since turning professional in 1996. In just four years, he has won all four major championships, becoming, at 24, the youngest player to do so. He set the scoring record in each of them, and he has attracted a record number of TV viewers just about every week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With three tournaments still to play, his nine victories this year are the most in one PGA Tour season since 1950, and he is on pace to shatter the all-time season scoring average set by Byron Nelson in 1945.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In June, he gave \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a huge lift when he switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball. He went on to win the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach by 15 strokes, the largest winning margin in the 140-year history of major championship golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods devotes a substantial amount of time to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the Beaverton, Ore., company has used him effectively in their TV ads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PUGA IS AMATEUR CHAMP: Greg Puga, a caddie at an exclusive California country club, became the youngest winner in the 20-year history of the U.S. Mid-Amateur on Thursday with a 3-and-1 victory over a faltering Wayne Raath at Hot Springs, Va.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Puga was 2-down after the front nine but caught the 25-year-old South African by making a critical 10-foot par putt on the 10th, a birdie on the 11th and a par putt on No. 12 when Raath drove into a lateral hazard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FALDO, JAMES "CLEAR THE AIR': Nick Faldo and Mark James agreed to a truce in their Ryder Cup feud that has lasted nearly four months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've cleared the air, and I think it's the end of the matter," James said after a clubhouse discussion with Faldo at the Lancome Trophy event, in which both are playing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We agreed there are two sides to every argument, but we've cleared the air."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Oxfam Australia-Community Aid Abroad report said workers were threatened with violence if they tried to join unions.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He spent August in a slum in Indonesia trying to live on the wage of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worker - about 80p a day. "You can survive, but you cannot live on that," Keady said. "It's a starvation wage."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Workers were "flabbergasted" when they discovered how much athletes were paid for endorsements, he said. "They begged us to bring these athletes to their homes to see how they are forced to survive," he said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it had undertaken to raise wages and had improved conditions. "We uphold the Olympic ideal of human dignity," a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NEW YORK:  Tiger Woods put a $US90 million ($150 million) contract into jeopardy yesterday by choosing to join the ranks of striking minor actors instead of shooting a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was due to shoot the latest ad in a popular series starring the golfing prodigy when Woods announced he was supporting the Screen Actors Guild's campaign to get better pay for commercials. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it, his agent Mark Steinberg said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' sponsorship deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is being renegotiated at present, with industry commentators predicting he could easily earn up to $US90 million over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The extraordinary popularity of his ads, particularly one in which he expertly bounces a golf ball of a club head, ensures \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will probably not complain too loudly about Woods' no-show at the scheduled shoot at Islesworth Country Club, his home course near Orlando, Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the company was clearly concerned the ad, which it had hoped to release on June 15 to coincide with the start of the US Open, would not be finished in time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Mike Kelly said it was unclear when
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods would be available for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 a new shoot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The last I heard it was to be rescheduled," Mr Kelly said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger's schedule is pretty hectic so it's hard to say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It may be a couple of months, it may be a couple of weeks."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' move ensured the strike, which involves 135,000 actors but so far has attracted limited attention, was thrown into the headlines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We deeply appreciate the support of this international superstar," SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  WORLD No.1 golfer Tiger Woods has signed a new five-year contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth a minimum of $122 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A report on the Web site Tourinsider.com said Woods agreed to the deal after winning last week's US PGA Championship. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Phil Knight, the co-founder of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  empire, is determined to build on the instant success of the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball, which Woods used for the first time competitively in Germany in May and has since won five times, including three major titles," wrote Web golf writer Bill Blighton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Woods was reported to have been paid $122 million by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when he turned professional in 1996.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The athletic-shoe maker has created a division called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Techlab after several years of study.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first of five new products is a digital audio player that will be in retail stores in July and was produced in collaboration with S3's Diamond Multimedia division -- the makers of Rio Audio digital players.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Intel Corp., the world's largest chipmaker, said Wednesday it shipped nearly one million computer circuit boards that could contain a defect that destroys important files. Shares fell 4 per cent on the news.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Santa Clara-based company sells a variety of parts that go into a computer, including the motherboard, the primary component on which the processors, main memory and support circuitry rest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some motherboards shipped since November have a defective "memory translator hub" that experiences problems in moving signals between a cheaper form of random access memory called SDRAM and the 820 Intel processor, said spokesman Michael Sullivan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Electrical problems "can cause some systems to intermittently reset, reboot and/or hang," Intel said in a statement, and "can under extreme conditions, potentially cause data corruption." Intel said it would replace the affected motherboards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The motherboards were shipped to a variety of computer manufacturers, including major customers such as Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SALEM, N.H. -- Cisco Systems Inc. plans a major expansion into New Hampshire that could bring 2,500 new jobs into the northeastern U.S. state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Internet network equipment provider said it has agreed to buy about 45 hectares and a building in Salem near the Massachusetts border for a New England equipment manufacturing Centre.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The move is part of Cisco's plans for expansion and substantial growth in New England, and closely follows word that the company is opening a research centre in Massachusetts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The tremendous demand for Internet technology, specifically the growth in optical network solutions, has created the need for this most recent expansion in manufacturing", said Carl Redfield, senior vice-president of manufacturing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new centre will be used to test and assemble products and distribute them worldwide. The company said up to 2,500 jobs will be created within the next five years.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. says that its group operating profit fell 18 per cent last year because of a weaker U.S. dollar and a worldwide fall in prices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The maker of National and Panasonic consumer electronics products reported operating profit of $1.45 billion for the year ended March 31. That's down from $1.77 billion last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sales slid 4.5 per cent to $66.7 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Japanese exporters' results remain tied to exchange rate fluctuations. Recently, Sony Corp. said the dollar's decline against the yen was a major reason for the 31 per cent decline in its group operating profit for the year that ended March 31.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Matsushita said one dollar bought an average of 113 yen in the year that ended March 31, less than the 128 yen in the previous year. A weaker U.S. dollar hurts profits when companies exchange greenbacks earned overseas for yen.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Montreal-based mobile phone operator reported it had a net loss of $113.9 million US in the period, compared with a loss of $81.6 million last year. The per-share loss rose to $1.51 from $1.13. However, consolidated revenues increased to $169.5 million from $128.3 million, and total cell phone subscribers hit more than 2.5 million, almost double the customer base last year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BEAVERTON, Ore. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  announced it will begin selling the golf ball Tiger Woods uses in competition next March.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy TW golf ball, which the 24-year-old began playing in June, will have a cover and core about 5 percent harder than the Tour Accuracy TA ball, which debuted in May. Otherwise, the two golf balls will be the same, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said in August that Woods, the world's top-ranked player, didn't use the same golf ball company advertising claimed. The nonprofit group Public Remedies Inc. sued in U.S. District Court in San Francisco alleging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was misleading consumers in ads for the Tour Accuracy ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We think there's going to be a lot of curiosity among golfers of all skill levels to play the same golf ball Tiger Woods plays," said Bob Wood, president of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf division. "It'll work best with someone with a pretty high swing speed or an angle of attack that puts a lot of spin on the ball."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 JACKSON, Miss. Second-round play was suspended due to rain in a Stage II qualifier at Colonial Country Club.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Senior PGA qualifying
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 RIO RICO, Ariz. Vallejo's Ron Parsons shot a 1-under 71 to move into a tie for 12th place in a regional qualifier at the Rio Rico Resort course. Parsons, a former Oakley resident who has made it to the finals three years in a row, trailed leader Rod Murry (70-142) by four shots. Pleasant Hill's Gary Vanier was at 75-148, Walnut Creek's Sandy McCall was at 77-151, and Clayton's Bob Boldt was at 81-160.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Fresh off his record-breaking summer of golf, Tiger Woods is on the verge of signing a $100-million US endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be the richest in sports, The Associated Press has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, his agent at IMG, declined to discuss specifics of the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 deal on Thursday, only to say it was an "outstanding contract." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are within days of a signature," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but what

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' previous contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was said to be $40 million US over five years. He was used heavily in their advertisements and established his own line of clothing and shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A source close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, described it as the "largest contract in sports marketing history," worth about $100 million US over five years.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ABORIGINAL leaders have accused sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of cashing in on the reconciliation debate with an Olympic advertising campaign featuring sprinter Cathy Freeman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Aboriginal Development Council chairwoman Lowitja O'Donoghue and National Sorry Day chairwoman Audrey Kinnear attacked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest "Sorry" television advertisement, in which Olympians including marathon runner Steve Moneghetti apologise for spending time away from their families at training. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She said Freeman had been "used" in the campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's very distasteful and insensitive of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use Cathy as an indigenous person; I can see a lot of our people will be hurt by the fact that she's been used this way," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It makes me really upset. These ads trivialise the whole reconciliation process ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is capitalising on our Sorry."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms O'Donoghue said she was offended by the advertisement, which first screened on June 11, two weeks after thousands of Australians said sorry to the stolen generations at Corroboree 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Of course it was a reference to our Sorry," she said. "It's far too much of a coincidence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the advertisement, Freeman turns to the camera and mouths the words: "Can we talk about this later?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia marketing director Brent Scrimshaw said there was no subtext.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It is in no way our intention to use Cathy in that way or for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to gain any commercial benefit from the reconciliation debate," Mr Scrimshaw said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ABORIGINAL leaders have accused sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of cashing in on the reconciliation debate with an Olympic advertising campaign featuring sprinter Cathy Freeman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Aboriginal Development Council chairwoman Lowitja O'Donoghue and National Sorry Day chairwoman Audrey Kinnear attacked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest "Sorry" television advertisement, in which Olympians including marathon runner Steve Moneghetti apologise for spending time away from their families at training. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She said Freeman had been "used" in the campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's very distasteful and insensitive of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use Cathy as an indigenous person; I can see a lot of our people will be hurt by the fact that she's been used this way," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It makes me really upset. These ads trivialise the whole reconciliation process ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is capitalising on our Sorry."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms O'Donoghue said she was offended by the advertisement, which first screened on June 11, two weeks after thousands of Australians said sorry to the stolen generations at Corroboree 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Of course it was a reference to our Sorry," she said. "It's far too much of a coincidence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the advertisement, Freeman turns to the camera and mouths the words: "Can we talk about this later?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Australia marketing director Brent Scrimshaw said there was no subtext.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It is in no way our intention to use Cathy in that way or for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to gain any commercial benefit from the reconciliation debate," Mr Scrimshaw said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MORE than Pounds 940 million was wiped from the stock market value of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday morning when the sportswear giant said profits would be lower than estimates (Adam Jones writes).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shares lost 19 per cent even though the company said earnings per share are likely to rise by at least 20 per cent in 2000. Profit growth in 2001 is expected to be slower. American sportswear shops are having to close stores and cut back on retail space, affecting orders for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes and clothes. The chain Just For Feet, a big customer, has filed for bankruptcy protection.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also being punished by the strength of the dollar against the euro. The company's shares were trading as high as $ 58.75 last October, but closed at $ 36.69 in New York last night.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS today added a new ball to his armoury and immediately walked into trouble both on and off the golf course.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods used his defence of the \'a31.6 million Deutsche Bank-SAP Open TPC of Europe Championship at Gut Kaden to play a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball for the first time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was only in January that the world No 1 began a new five-year contract with Titleist, reported to be worth \'a36m to use that company's clubs and balls. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Titleist officials were staying tight-lipped over Woods' unexpected switch but it is thought the 24-year-old American had a clause in the new deal that enabled him to terminate it at short notice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  celebrations over a boost to their association with Woods - he is playing here with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signature 'swooshes' on his cap, sweater, glove and shoes - were cut short as he bogeyed his two opening holes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  That was hardly the sort of golf \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might have expected from a player who is shortly expected to sign a new agreement at least doubling value of the five-year, \'a324m deal he accepted when he turned professional in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The business of selling golf balls to the public is a lucrative one and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have entered the market with a strong promotional push that included signing up Open champion Paul Lawrie to endorse their new product.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Woods would be the biggest capture of them all. Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, said: "Golf is a business where it's tough on the equipment side to break through. For him to play our product says a lot about it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The thing about Tiger is he's completely about winning."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Alas, Woods looked anything but a winner on a chilly morning. His opening tee shot at the par four 10th found clawing rough and his recovery scattered spectators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Then he could only advance the ball five yards out of even deeper rough, leaving 30 yards between him and the pin which he negotiated in two for a bogey five.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At the next hole he hit over the green and when his wedge at the pin fell short Woods slammed the club into his bag in anger at the poor start which left him five shots behind early pacesetter Michael Jonzon of Sweden.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Latest range of shoes incorporates high-density, durable foam used to cushion Formula One race-car engines
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE highly-resistant foam used to cushion Formula One race-car engines is what sporting giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has placed in its new range of sports shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Apart from controlling impact, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims the shoes -called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox -will put the spring back into your step.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The breakthrough, in the form of four columns at the heel of each shoe, placed between two thermoplastic plates, is the result of more than 16 years of research and testing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sports-research laboratory director Mario Lafortune: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox is the most tested piece of footwear technology to come out of the lab."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The columns are made of a type of high-density, durable foam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Speaking to reporters in Tokyo, he added: "Just like the suspension system of a car, the columns are the suspension system for the athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They make the difference between landing on concrete and landing on a small trampoline."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the company has not discarded its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air technology either. The famous cushioning system is in place in the sole of the shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are three types of shoes, for both men and woman -running, cross-training and basketball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The columns in the running and cross-training shoes collapse quickly to slow the foot, then expand back to original height to propel the foot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For basketball players, on the other hand, the columns turn inwards so that the wearer has more stability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the shoes are yet to be released to the mass market, observant viewers may have already seen them on the feet of Olympic athletes like "Slam Dunk King" Vince Carter of the United States basketball team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But when does sporting gear cross the line from enhancing an athlete's performance to giving him an unfair advantage?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Divisional Vice President and Global Brand Director of Running Juliet Moran: "That's an interesting challenge. And I think the lines are becoming a little more blurred."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're trying to create products which do not interfere with what your body is trying to achieve, by eliminating injury, for example."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shoes will be available here by the end of the year, and will cost about US$ 150 (S$ 255).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Sneaker and sportswear marketer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is diversifying into high-tech sports gear after several years of study and has has created a division called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Techlab.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first of five new products to be offered is a digital audio player that will be in stores in July and was produced in collaboration with S3's Diamond Multimedia division - the makers of Rio Audio digital players.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said four other products would be in stores for the Christmas holiday season, including real-time speed-distance and heart-rate monitoring devices, a digital compass and handheld sport communication products. 3M for misleading clients  Dreyfus, the mutual fund unit of Mellon Financial, agreed to pay almost $3 million to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that the firm misled investors about the performance of one of its mutual funds. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SEC accused Dreyfus of inflating the first-year returns of its Aggressive Growth Fund and failing to properly oversee trades by the fund's former manager, Michael Schonberg.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dreyfus will pay $950,000 to the SEC and will contribute $1.6 million toward investor education programs at the State University of New York. The firm also will pay $400,000 to cover the cost of New York's investigation. Schonberg will pay the SEC $50,000 and agreed to a nine-month suspension that bars him from working for any investment adviser. Time for some changes  Henry Muller, Time Inc.'s editorial director, will become an editor at large beginning Oct. 1. In that capacity, Muller will write for various Time Inc. magazines, according to Time Inc. editor in chief Norman Pearlstine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also, Isolde Motley, most recently managing editor of Life magazine, will become corporate editor of Time Inc. and will work directly with Pearlstine on a number of editorial projects.  Crazy Eddie retribution  Shareholders in the failed Crazy Eddie electronics chain should get $72.7 million from three of the company's principals who engaged in stock fraud, Federal Judge Harold Ackerman has ruled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investors lost at least $145.9 million when Crazy Eddie collapsed in 1987 in one of the nation's largest swindles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If collected, the $72.7 million would be in addition to $120 million they already have received in compensation, most of it from bank accounts that founder Eddie Antar kept around the globe.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTS goods manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  moved to reassure parents today after reports that some of its football shirts were laced with a toxic chemical used in anti-barnacle paint on ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which makes the Arsenal shirt worn by many youngsters in London, said it was carrying out its own tests and there was no need for panic. Fears were raised over the safety of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -made shirts of German side Borussia Dortmund after a German TV show commissioned tests on the kit and reported its findings earlier this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The show claims the shirts contain a chemical used on the bottom of sea vessels but also used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  British and Dutch tests have shown that Tributyltin or TBT can cause mutations in marine snails and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At high levels in humans, it is believed to cause neurological probems, damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist with a German institute for consumer health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said initial testing failed to detect any TBT in the shirts, although further tests were necessary.

Last week, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chairman Phil Knight withdrew plans to donate $30 million to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, after that school joined the consortium.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Edie Payne, at 93 Australia's oldest surviving Olympian,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  officially opened the athletes' village at the main Sydney Games
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  site yesterday as the first 2,000 competitors took up residence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Payne, who competed at the 1928 Amsterdam Games as a sprinter, broke down and cried in her wheelchair after welcoming the athletes and dignitaries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The 2,000 athletes who arrived yesterday will be joined by about 8,000 more over the next 10 days prior to the opening ceremonies on Sept. 15. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Some 5,000 officials from 199 countries and the territory of East Timor will also be in residence. They will be looked after by a staff of 7,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The village, which cost $350 million (U.S.), became the fifth-largest city in New South Wales when it opened. It has 1,000 houses and apartments in the same area as 13 venues that will stage 17 sports. Services available to athletes include a supermarket, post office, bank, florist, travel agency, medical centre and disco.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The village will become the Sydney suburb of Newington after the Games.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  failing a drug test.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Liu Yunfeng, who was China's top prospect in the men's 20-kilometre walk, tested positive July 13, the official China Daily reported yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Liu's fate hinges on the result of tests on a second sample, the newspaper said. It did not name the drug found in Liu's first sample and did not say when the second result was expected.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  group NikeWatch said it will release a report tomorrow detailing workplace practices at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Indonesian factories. The group says workers are earning as little as 40 cents an hour to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NikeWatch is planning events in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide and has planned a mock Olympic opening ceremony to publicize claims about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  poor workplace ethics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rejected the claim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They have the right issue, it's an honourable issue," Vada Manager, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  head of global issues, said yesterday. "Targeting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , though, is the wrong company."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  basketball team for its game with Brazil and led the U.S. to a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  75-53 victory yesterday in a key Games tuneup.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Swoopes, the WNBA's regular-season MVP, had 18 points and six rebounds. Lisa Leslie added 15 points, and Yolanda Griffith 13 as the United States made amends for one of only two losses in the past year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Brazil, runner-up to the U.S. at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, surprised the Americans 64-55 at home in March. The U.S. squad's only other defeat in 35 games dating to last September was to Tennessee.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fresh off his record-breaking summer of golf, Tiger Woods is on the verge of signing a $100-million US endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be the richest in sports, The Associated Press has learned. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, his agent at IMG, declined to discuss specifics of the deal Thursday, only to say it was an ''outstanding contract.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but what he has done for golf and sports,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' previous contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was said to be $40 million US over five years.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The bodyguards had been guarding US athletes Carl Lewis and Marion Jones at a Redfern youth club when they got the call: Sydney's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shop was under attack. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 100 demonstrators had gathered outside the Icon sports shop in George Street yesterday for the city's first protest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fresh from Melbourne's S-11 protest, the Campaign Against Corporate Tyranny United in Struggle (CACTUS) was railing against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank summit in Prague as the bodyguards took up positions outside the store's locked doors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The proprietors had put up a notice saying "this store is independently owned and operated" but they forgot to take down the "authorised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dealer" sign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the megaphone, Socialist Worker editor Ms Alison Stewart harangued passersby and exhorted the protesters to march and march they did: down George Street to the Westpac Bank, up Martin Place to Commonwealth Bank, into the Domain to regroup and then gather in Macquarie Street outside Parliament baying "shame Carr shame".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police let the march roll on, holding up commuter traffic until protesters peeled off down Phillip Street to gather outside the prime ministerial offices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A charge through the open plate glass doors caught police by surprise and a brief brawl followed as protesters were repulsed by extra officers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Inspector Dave Darcy, who was commanding the police, said: "There has been a tradition of non-violent protests in Sydney but a few blow-ins have changed all that. Pushing cops into plate glass windows is not on."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SIR ALEX FERGUSON is being head-hunted by sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to become their football ambassador - on a massive contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talks between the Manchester United boss and the American-based company are at an advanced stage and Ferguson may sign a deal shortly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson has been targeted by the firm as the ideal man to front their push for top football contracts with clubs and players worldwide. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He revealed he is considering one highly- lucrative job offer to United shareholders after being pursued by dozens of top companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I've got a lot of offers already. One of them is really staggering. It would be a four-year contract for a huge amount of money and would involve a lot of travelling."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The salary being discussed is around pounds 1million-a-year on a four-year contract with VIP expenses, and the possibilities of bonuses are endless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may even be willing to offer Ferguson the job on a 'part-time' basis, leaving him to keep other interests in football and horse racing. However, it would too demanding for Ferguson to work at United in a significant capacity, and would be the end of that association if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are successful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson is still intent on retiring from Old Trafford when his present contract runs out in two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite United's new chief Peter Kenyon claiming that he would like him to stay, talks with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are progressing well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson would be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  football equivalent of Tiger Woods, the world's finest golfer who is synonymous with their products.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ironically, United are with major rivals Umbro, a deal that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have coveted for years only to fall foul of a 'special relationship' between club and company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But now the fight is between United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for Ferguson's services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As well as revealing aspects about his own future, Ferguson revealed how the club plan to tempt the game's best players to United by offering shares in the world's richest club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They plan to introduce a share saver scheme in an effort to counter the incredible wages available in Italy and Spain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Instead of paying players pounds 100,000-a-week they would be give the opportunity to buy shares in the world's richest club at a special rate.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This has quickly become the impoverished country's top exporter, but has faced industrial action and accusations of running sweatshops.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We just don't tolerate child labour," Ms Iwaniuk said. "What we're trying to do is set a standard."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls in TV and magazine ads. But he really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged yesterday after being sued in federal court. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the balls used by Woods for his monster swings that produce 300-plus-yard drives have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball," said Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products: irons, putters and golf balls for tour players," Kelly said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly what their pros endorse.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NEW YORK: A New York orthopaedic surgeon has sued \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for pounds 7 million, saying shoes made by the sportswear giant tripped her.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 COLORADO SPRINGS - Although the University of Colorado's deal  with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not expire until June 2001, athletic director Dick  Tharp said the school wants a contract extension in place before  the start of the football season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'I don't see that as a problem,' Tharp said during the Big 12  Conference spring meetings at The Broadmoor. 'I think the  University of Colorado and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been good partners.' 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CU's six-year agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ends in late June of next  year. The deal provides a minimum of $ 500,000 annually to the  school plus $ 600,000 in equipment, uniforms, compensation to  coaches, funding of summer camps and performance bonuses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some CU students have staged protests against the school's  involvement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , attacking the reported poor treatment of  factory workers overseas by the shoe company. Tharp said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a  progressive company that always has been ahead of its competition  with regard to socio-economic and human rights issues. He said  current negotiations with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involve business issues, not 'sweat  shop' issues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earlier this spring, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  terminated its negotiations with the  University of Michigan, allowing a six-year, $ 6 million contract  to expire Aug. 31. Michigan wanted the shoe company to comply with  the school's Labor Standards and Human Rights Policy, which  features a statement of principles for a licensee code of conduct.  The code requires disclosure of licensee manufacturing sites,  disclosure of licensee manufacturing sites wages, women's rights  and methods of ensuring compliance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tharp speculated a bigger factor in the breakdown of  negotiations between Michigan and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was that the school may  have asked for too much money. Some other shoe companies have  declined to renew contracts with colleges. Less competition gives  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more leverage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Preseason All-Americans
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Four Big 12 players have been named to Playboy Magazine's  preseason football team: Nebraska's Carlos Polk (6-foot-2, 250  pounds), a senior middle linebacker; Texas' Leonard Davis (6-6,  355), a senior offensive tackle; Kansas State's David Allen (5-9,  195), a senior kick-returner, and Missouri's Justin Smith (6-5,  256), a junior defensive end.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Defending Bob Knight
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Baylor basketball coach Dave Bliss learned under Indiana coach  Bob Knight at Army (1967-69) and Indiana (1971-75). Bliss is  relieved that his embattled mentor did not lose his job over  claims by former Hoosiers player Neil Reed that he was choked by  Knight during a 1997 practice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a university investigation, Knight was suspended for  three games and fined $ 30,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'I don't think even he condones some of the things that go on,  and I'm just glad it didn't end there,' Bliss said. 'I thought it  took (IU president) Myles Brand tremendous courage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'His school president gave him a reprieve at a time when maybe  people were calling for his scalp. He deserved that because he's  been great for college basketball. He's had a dramatic effect on  young coaches who can take and glean the good out of how he  coaches, the technique and honor and work ethic all those things.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bliss spoke by phone with Knight about three weeks ago. Bliss  said Knight can discipline himself enough to function under the  'zero tolerance' policy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'I'll tell you what, Bob Knight can do anything Bob Knight  wants to do,' Bliss said. 'He was held accountable for some things  that happened 15 or 20 years ago.'

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger Woods has gained his extraordinary success this year using a ball made specifically for him and not available to the public. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been sued because of it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company has been taken to court in San Francisco, where it is alleged that providing that ball is "an unfair business practice" because Woods endorses one ball but plays another. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A non-profit-making organisation called Public Remedies Inc contends that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should return "their ill-gotten gains" to the public because "Woods does not play the Precision Tour Accuracy golf ball" that is advertised on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  website as being "the ball Tiger used to tame Pebble Beach". Woods won the US Open at Pebble Beach by 15 shots.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He also used the special ball to win the other two majors he took this season, the Open Championship at St Andrews and the US PGA last week at Valhalla.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Public Remedies alleges that the Woods ball has "different composition and performance characterisitics specially made for him and not available to the general public". This is partly conceded by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , whose marketing director Mike Kelly said the ball used by Woods "has a slightly firmer inner and outer core than the marketed ball".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Kelly claimed: "It is industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products for Tour players."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This is denied by other market leaders. Titleist, whose ball Woods used until halfway through this season, said: "Our contracted players use the products they advertise. And, if a product is tweaked for a particular player, the customer could order it in that form. We don't make claims that cannot be substantiated."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Callaway said: "If one of our professionals uses a certain club, that identical club is available retail."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Regardless of legal conclusions, the moral ramifications of one ball for the pros and another for the amateurs are far-reaching. One of the joys of golf is that everyone can play the same course with the same clubs and the same ball, then measure comparative performance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As it happens the ball being used by Woods would probably feel like a pebble if hit by ordinary mortals, for it needs the enormous swing speed created by his whiplash action through the hitting area to compress the ball sufficiently to send it the 330-350 yards that the American achieves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the principle remains that the ball should be available to anyone who wants it, and there is also the matter of Woods endorsing a ball he does not use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Yesterday Woods played down the affair before the NEC Invitational World Championship here in Ohio: "There are a lot of players with balls that are not on the market, a lot of shafts that are not on the market, and the club heads we use are tinkered around with - the weight of them, the face structure of them, the way they are shaped. These are things the public cannot have access to; that's just the way it is."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tinkering is one thing, making a ball specifically for one player another, and the game's authorities need to monitor the development carefully.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Coincidentally Woods celebrates his fourth anniversary as a golf professional this week. In that time he has won Dollars 20,938,114 (pounds 14m) from winning 28 of 104 events in which he has played.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But perhaps the most mind-boggling statistic is that he has won more money in the past two seasons, with the exception of Davis Love III, than anyone else in a career on Tour - and mostly with a Titleist ball available to all and sundry.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is it the ball, or is Tiger Woods the greatest golfer in history?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence is mounting with each week that Tiger is in a class by himself.  At 24, he has become one of those figures who can be readily identified by a single name.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods doesn't simply win golf tournaments he dominates them. In two of his last three major wins, he set records for low scores and margins of victory. The only suspense at the NEC Invitational this weekend was whether Tiger would be able to finish his final round before play was called because of darkness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But for some reason, there are those who would deny Tiger his due and he has suffered a couple of recent public-relations setbacks. The first was when, despite his avowed support for the Screen Actors Guild strike, he circumvented the labour strife by taping a Buick commercial in Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then there's the ball. Tiger made a much-heralded switch to a new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball prior to the British Open, but a consumer-watchdog group took \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to court, claiming that the ball \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is selling and the ball Tiger is playing are not the same. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  admitted this was true, suggested that golfers probably wouldn't want to use the same ball and then said it planned all along to make the ball available and that it will soon be in your neighbourhood pro shop.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Personally, I think anyone who feels their performance can be enhanced by wearing a particular shirt or swinging a particular club or using a particular ball, should be treated to an immediate reality check.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And when it comes to celebrity endorsements, harken back to Jerry Maguire and remember the mantra of the pro athlete: Show Me the Money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Athletes routinely endorse products and equipment because they are paid to do so. Whether they actually use those products is another matter. In most cases, the top athletes have equipment custom-made to their specifications. There may a similar product with their name on it in the sporting goods store but it bears as much resemblance to the real thing as a NASCAR stock car does to the stock at your local Ford or Pontiac dealer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of my favourite stories about equipment goes back to the early days of metal tennis racquets. A company called Chemold developed an aluminum racquet and enticed Rod Laver and Roy Emerson to endorse the product. The Aussie stars picked up the new racquets and found they couldn't play with them. The went to the wooden Dunlop Maxply models they were using but painted them silver and applied Chemold decals. The company was then swamped for requests for the ''aluminum'' racquets which didn't exist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ivan Lendl once moved from adidas to Mizuno but was reluctant to give up the war clubs adidas had been making for him. Mizuno obliged by making exact replicas but they were so unwieldy, they were never made for the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Occasionally, an athlete will find a piece of equipment he likes and will use even if he isn't being paid. That was the case with his Wilson T-2000 racquet. Wilson couldn't sell the metal racquet because most players couldn't control their shots. Connors is the only player who could play with the racquet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TOO MUCH TIGER? The TV networks are only too happy to give Tiger lots of coverage because his presence means great ratings. a couple of weeks ago, The Golf Channel showed taped coverage of Tiger's first-round and ignored some live action at the Buick Open.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There have been no complaints from fans but some agents representing other players on the PGA Tour are unhappy. If there's more of Tiger, there's less of their clients and that means less exposure for the companies they promote on their caps, shirts and golf bags.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maybe they should get the message and work a little harder and try to mount a challenge to Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SELIG PUSHES LORIA: We found it interesting that baseball commissioner Bud Selig has told Expos head honcho Jeffrey Loria he has to do a better job of marketing the team and that includes a TV deal and some English radio coverage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You might recall earlier this year that Loria took a hard line on broadcast negotiations and suggested he was taking his lead from Major League Baseball. There were suggestions that baseball looked askance at deals where teams bought time on radio stations or entered into shared-risk deals but the reality is that at least a dozen have such deals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I've said all along that the Expos will still be in Montreal next season because they have no place to go and it's time for Loria to give the fans some reason to support this team . In the most recent audience he granted the Montreal media, he complained about inaccurate reports concerning the buyout of the local owners but Loria has only himself to blame because he has not done anything to correct what he regards as misinformation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SMALL MARKET? Here's another example of why Montreal is regarded as a small market. After announcing that it would offer the NFL Sunday Ticket and NHL Centre Ice packages, Videotron has announced that neither will be available for the time being. The cable monopoly says it hasn't sold enough packages although I've heard complaints that the company has made few attempts to market the packages which are very popular elsewhere in Canada and in the U.S.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THOUSANDS of companies have, over the past years, been unable to establish a good reputation among their consumer audience.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unfortunately, this has often been the case because they failed to achieve synergy between their strategic intentions and the real outcomes the market perceived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  provides us with a classic example. During 1999, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  diluted its brand dramatically. The "Just Do It" ethos became a nightmare tagline when it became global knowledge that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exploited labour in third-world countries. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Just Do It was translated into counter-campaign t-shirts bearing the slogan Just Don't Do It. Thus, the philosophy and marketing drive which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had spent years creating was washed down the drain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This fatality has to do with 180-degree branding. Quick branding doesn't exist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To think it does would be like painting the roof of your house to repair the holes. This is the type of dilemma most doctom sites face.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the surface, their image is perfect, but just beneath the surface, the holes appear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the split second in which you make purchases from the site or, worse, during the longer time you spend contacting them with requests or returning products, it's then the rain and wind start coming through the holes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dotcom branding has, until today, covered the first 10 degrees. What about the other 350? A recent study conducted by Bang & Olufsen, the high-quality stereo equipment manufacturer, shows that the future of branding doesn't lie in imaging, the product itself or the ads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's the whole brand story that counts. The term "story branding" is based on the philosophy that every product needs a story to prompt the consumer's involvement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I'll give an example: At home I have a salt and pepper set designed by Arne Jacobsen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's nice, but not something you would spend hours talking to your guests about. But there is a story behind the pair that you would find fascinating if you were at my table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  You see, almost 50 years ago the designer had dinner with one of his business partners who admired this salt and pepper set he had designed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THOUSANDS of companies have, over the past years, been unable to establish a good reputation among their consumer audience.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unfortunately, this has often been the case because they failed to achieve synergy between their strategic intentions and the real outcomes the market perceived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  provides us with a classic example. During 1999, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  diluted its brand dramatically. The "Just Do It" ethos became a nightmare tagline when it became global knowledge that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exploited labour in third-world countries. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Just Do It was translated into counter-campaign t-shirts bearing the slogan Just Don't Do It. Thus, the philosophy and marketing drive which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had spent years creating was washed down the drain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This fatality has to do with 180-degree branding. Quick branding doesn't exist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To think it does would be like painting the roof of your house to repair the holes. This is the type of dilemma most doctom sites face.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the surface, their image is perfect, but just beneath the surface, the holes appear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the split second in which you make purchases from the site or, worse, during the longer time you spend contacting them with requests or returning products, it's then the rain and wind start coming through the holes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dotcom branding has, until today, covered the first 10 degrees. What about the other 350? A recent study conducted by Bang & Olufsen, the high-quality stereo equipment manufacturer, shows that the future of branding doesn't lie in imaging, the product itself or the ads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's the whole brand story that counts. The term "story branding" is based on the philosophy that every product needs a story to prompt the consumer's involvement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I'll give an example: At home I have a salt and pepper set designed by Arne Jacobsen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's nice, but not something you would spend hours talking to your guests about. But there is a story behind the pair that you would find fascinating if you were at my table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  You see, almost 50 years ago the designer had dinner with one of his business partners who admired this salt and pepper set he had designed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The business partner was so fascinated by the design that he asked his partner to design a whole hotel around his salt and pepper set. And so he did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It took Arne 20 years but the hotel he designed became a bit of an icon in Copenhagen. Not only was the hotel designed to match the shakers, so were the plates, the curtains, the beds and, well, everything.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What is your perception of this salt and pepper set now? Has it changed? Probably, and you haven't even seen it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Strong branding is all about creating a story or, if a story already exists, making it spin off the product and the brand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fascinating stories quite often create the foundation for the whole brand -- its philosophy, its direction and its ethos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  No matter whether you're a business-to-business player, a clicks-&-mortar partner or just trying to win your brand strong customer loyalty, dig into your history. Perhaps you have a goldmine somewhere which can create your full 360-degree branding.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 BEAVERTON, Ore.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BEAVERTON, Ore. -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chairman Phil Knight complained Thursday about the University of Oregon's decision to join an organization of students and activists protesting sweatshop conditions at clothing and shoe industry factories abroad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Knight, an Oregon graduate and track athlete, declined to comment on a television report that he would withdraw a reported $30 million pledge to help expand Autzen Stadium because the school joined the Worker Rights Consortium last week. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Still, he hinted he may be rethinking his financial generosity toward the university, saying the school was free to join the consortium but "it does not mean that we are required to support those efforts with which we have fundamental disagreements."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight refused to confirm the size of the stadium donation or a report by Portland-based KGW-TV, which quoted unidentified sources as saying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told university officials Monday that Knight was withdrawing his pledge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The details of Phil's private philanthropy have and will continue to be personal," according to the company statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oregon officials said no changes had been made in any donations to the project.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We had not heard from any of our donors that anything was any different, whether it was Phil Knight or anybody else," Dave Williford, UO sports information director, said Thursday.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has repeatedly been the target of labor rights groups who have admitted their strategy is aimed at the Beaverton-based athletic shoe company because it is an industry leader and can pressure other companies to follow its example.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  billionaire co-founder who once sold shoes from the back of his car at Oregon track meets, defended the company's labor record, saying it had become a leader in ensuring worker rights around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He noted that, since he appeared at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in May 1998 to promise industry reforms, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased its minimum age requirements for footwear workers to an industry high of 18.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has raised wages more than 70 percent for footwear workers in Indonesia during the last 20 months, improved air quality at factories and disclosed the location of 45 domestic and foreign factories producing clothing licensed by U.S. colleges and universities.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  GOLFING sensation Tiger Woods is set to sign a five-year pounds 60million sponsorship deal - the biggest in sporting history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which will put 24-year-old Tiger well on his way to becoming sport's first billionaire, comes on top of another endorsement deal he signed earlier this year with Buick, which is worth pounds 20 million over five years. Tiger now has contracts with 11 companies. Financial experts believe, because he is so young, it is "virtually certain" he will make a billion by the time he is 40.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This summer Tiger became the youngest player to complete the Grand Slam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His agent Mark Steinberg said: "He's 24. That's the key to this.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "He's limitless. He's finally being recognised as the greatest athlete on the planet."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf president Bob Wood said: "It's not often you get a chance to work with somebody who's the best in the world at what they do."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger has represented \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since turning professional in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His father Earl Woods said he felt his son would do more for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that legendary basketball player Michael Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And Bob Wood agreed that was "definitely possible".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "His professional longevity is greater than Michael's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Basketball players have a 15-year career if they're fortunate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger has 24 more majors to play, just in the time period he is under contract with us. He has 104 majors left until he gets to the Senior Tour."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger's deal dwarfs those of other sporting stars. Soccer ace Alan Shearer has a pounds 15million package with Umbro while racing driver David Coulthard gets pounds 10million from Warsteiner beer.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  admits, under pressure of a lawsuit alleging false
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  advertising, that the golf balls Tiger Woods endorses for public
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  sale are not the same as the ones he actually uses in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  competition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The manufacturers apparently juice up Tiger's private stock a tad, installing a hard core. With a tiny flight crew on board (just kidding, it's really an auto-pilot set-up).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods, you may recall, switched to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from Titleist a while back amid some controversy and nastiness (i.e. there was a lot of money involved). Yesterday he told reporters that he "really can't see an appreciable difference" in distance between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball and the Titleist ball. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If the world's best player can't see the difference, how can us mere duffers, who watch the ads and buy the damn things? Sales of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls, by the way, have taken off like a Tiger 2-iron off the tee.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And, if they really do make juicier balls for the pros - ones that might turn you from a 27-handicap into, oh, a 26 - wouldn't it be good business to actually offer them up for sale to the voracious public?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  (Ad slogan idea: "Hard-core golf with Tiger Woods." Your welcome. . . . Woods has a mega-deal with Buick, too. Do you suppose he actually drives a Buick? Jeez, he's 24.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Reminder: Buyer beware.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Reminder, plus: It's not the golf ball anyway, dummy. It's the golfer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  LICENSE TO DO WHAT? The Canadian Olympic Association distributed a press release this
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  week urging consumers to patronize corporations which are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  official COA sponsors and warning us all to beware of "ambush
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  marketers" who try to capitalize on the Olympics without
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  supporting them. Fine, we'll keep an eye out for the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  carpetbaggers. But let's not be naive, either. It is not as if
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  the licensed corporate community does not reap huge profits from
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  the Olympic alliance and it is certainly not as if they channel
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  all those profits back into grassroots support of our athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  If only that were true.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NAME GAMES: The Miami Dolphins have an offensive lineman named Keno Hills.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Says Dennis Miller, the comedian on Monday Night Football
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  telecasts: "Keno Hills? Sounds like where those old blue-haired
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  ladies in Las Vegas want to be buried."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Film makers were shooting a scene this week at Cinergy Field in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Cincinnati for the movie Summer Catch, aimed for release next
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  spring. It stars Freddy Prinze Jr. as a minor league pitcher who
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  finally makes it to The Show and - wouldn't you just know it -
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  the first batter he faces is none other than Ken Griffey Jr.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What happens? You be the scriptwriter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ANYONE SEE A TREND? In terms of percentage of total capacity, Blue Jays attendance
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  ranks in a tie for second worst in the American League, through
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  last weekend. The Jays so far have sold 44 per cent of the seats
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  at the SkyDome, which is what the Devil Rays have done in Tampa
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Bay. Minnesota, meanwhile, has sold only 29 per cent of its
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  capacity. The Jays' average attendance of 22,279 is down 14.5 per
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  cent from last season and 26.5 from 1998, when they averaged
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  30,300.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE NAKED TRUTH: The latest issue of Maxim magazine features photos of several
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  female American Olympic athletes posing provocatively. One of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  them, pole vaulter Jill Witdtenwyler, defends herself against the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  anticipated detractors: "There's nothing wrong with promoting
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  sports through sex appeal. Let's face it: Sex sells, and the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  women of track and field are definitely sexy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  QB OR NOT QB: The tension between Buffalo Bills quarterbacks Doug Flutie and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Rob Johnson has resurfaced with publication of an interview with
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Johnson in the current issue of Penthouse magazine. Flutie, you
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  will recall, was stripped of the starting QB job during the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  playoffs, and with Johnson at the controls the Bills came up
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  short against Tennessee. Flutie subsequently said Buffalo would
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  have won if he'd been allowed to start (and F&F heartily agrees,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  for what it's worth). During the Penthouse interview, which was
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  conducted shortly after Flutie made his comments, Johnson said
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  the Bills might have won if Flutie "was covering kicks, maybe .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  . . maybe he could have been out there on that final play. I
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  think that (what Flutie said) was more of an insult to the entire
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  team. That's just the type of guy Doug is. He's not much fun to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  play with - you just have to deal with it." Johnson told
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  reporters in Buffalo this week that he meant Flutie was hard to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  be around that week in the playoffs, not always. "It was
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  insulting to me personally, but as a team you have to feel that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  there are 21 other guys out there making plays. We're a unit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  We're 53 guys. To say one guy would have made the difference?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  That's what I meant."

\par \pard 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has stirred up a tempest with its new Olympic TV commercial featuring a chain-saw-wielding maniac chasing a female athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC, the American carrier of the games, has pulled the ''Horror'' ad - part of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Why Sport? campaign - off the air. It features 1,500-metre American runner Suzy Hamilton being pursued through a house and dark woods by a man sporting a mask, similar to the one the killer wears in the Halloween movies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unlike most slasher movies, where the killer easily catches up with the female victim, Hamilton dashes to safety as the bad guy slogs off in defeat. The line at the end of the cheeky ad says, ''Why sport? You'll live longer.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC spokesman Maria Battaglia said the network received hundreds of complaints that the ad promotes violence against women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad will no longer run on NBC, though two other ads in the Why Sport? series - one featuring an Olympic cyclist performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on an elephant and an another portraying a battle between a gladiator and a skateboarder - will continue to be seen on the network. The commercial series was not sent to CBC.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is not the first time \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come into trouble because of its Olympic commercials. During the 1996 Atlanta summer games, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  enraged some athletes with in-your-face slogans such as ''You don't win the silver, you lose the gold,''and ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of Atlanta.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Scott Reames, a spokesman at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't trying to offend or make light of violence against women - ''in our view Suzy Hamilton is the victor, not the victim because of her athleticism.'' And though \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has fielded complaint calls regarding the ad, the company has also received compliments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''One woman called and said, 'I'm a runner. This is fantastic. Thank you for not portraying us as weak and scared,' '' Reames says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anne Hale, a marketing professor at the University of Victoria, disagrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's a good outcome, but the parametres are still a male aggressor and female victim. That is the stereotype that I think women, as a rule, are getting very tired of,'' Hale said, noting it's also inappropriate for that violent an ad to be shown during the Olympics, when kids are watching.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it would prosecute "to the fullest extent of the law" hackers who diverted its global website yesterday to the home page of a Melbourne-based activist group. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The hackers, who pulled off what has been hailed as one of the most elegant pieces of political hacking in recent memory, "hijacked" the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com domain name, diverting traffic to the home page of the "S11" alliance a coalition of union, student
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 and other groups critical of the workplace practices of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and other large multinationals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 S11, based at RMIT in Melbourne, is organising a protest at the World Economic Forum meeting in Melbourne on September 11 this year, following on from the protests that took place in Seattle and Washington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 S11 disowned the domain name hijacking, thanking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the extra traffic but issuing a statement saying it had "no knowledge of the identity, whereabouts, motives, or methods used by the disablers of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Corporation's website".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organisers said the first they heard about the hack was when they got a call from a journalist in Seattle, Washington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officials at the shoe and tracksuit maker refused to comment, but issued a statement saying that consumer credit card information was never compromised by the attack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The site was back online selling running shoes by the afternoon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After the facts are determined and security issues [sic] we intend to seek prosecution to the fullest extent of the law," the statement said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Federal Police in Victoria said they had not been asked by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to investigate S11.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The attack was most probably achieved by changing an entry at a central look-up site on the internet, known as a Domain Name Server.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DNSs are like the phone books of the internet, providing an interface between the spoken-word domain names of sites that a user would enter into a computer www.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com, for instance and the technical, 12-digit network addresses of the actual computers hosting the sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DNS hijacking involves illegally changing the network address that's listed as the host of the domain name, so that someone who types "www.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com" into their browser gets sent to another site, in this case the s11.org site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Because DNS servers around the world constantly exchange data with each other, a hacker changing an entry at one key DNS can quickly get the entry changed worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Step-by-step instructions showing how to hijack a website are readily available on the internet. It usually involves "social engineering", in that the hackers must somehow convince the administrator of the legitimate site address to ignore an e-mail warning them that their domain name entry is about to be changed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The recommended method for achieving this is bombarding the administrator with similar warnings, hoping he or she ignores them all or responds to the wrong one.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. launched an offensive yesterday
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  against critics who charge it with poor labour practices by
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  posting details on its Web site from the inspections of some of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  its 700 factories worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While the move may not please protesters who have called the PricewaterhouseCoopers audits biased and inaccurate, the audits will likely shed light on factory conditions and may spur feedback that improves \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  monitoring efforts, the company said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In April, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman Phil Knight said he would end donations to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, and revoked a $30 million (U.S.) pledge because the university is part of the watchdog Worker Rights Consortium, which does not give firms a say in setting terms for working conditions in Asia and Latin America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A consortium spokesperson was not available for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Consortium members have challenged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  audit, saying owners spruce up their factories for audits and workers are often afraid to tell the truth.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the first time in 98 tournaments around the world, Tiger Woods played golf Thursday with a swoosh instead of a Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the latest and loudest shot fired in the golf ball wars, Woods experimented with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf ball in the first round of the Deutsche Bank Open, leaving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hopeful it could use his massive appeal to grab a greater share of the market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake,'' said Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a 2-under 70 that left him three strokes out of the first-round lead, Woods said he has been experimenting with a version of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy the past few months while practicing at his home course outside Orlando, Fla.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Basically, I wanted a test round on the tour,'' Woods said. ''If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my ball.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods is under contract with Titleist, but industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said he has an escape clause that would allow him to terminate the deal on short notice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's in my contract that I can try any ball,'' Woods said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 UNIONS and community groups will begin a shame campaign targeting international sportswear manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An Indonesian garment worker who earns $55 a month will speak to the media and public at a series of events before the opening ceremony. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campaign organisers said the worker had been victimised by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for recruiting others to join a union.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NikeWatch website (www.caa.org.au/campaigns) says that in Asian factories where sports shoes are made it is common for employees to be overworked, underpaid and physically abused, and their health and safety neglected. Those who try to organise other workers are persecuted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Supporters allege the Indonesian man resigned after being threatened and his house was ransacked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His visit is sponsored by the unions' Fairwear campaign and Community Aid Abroad's NikeWatch, which uses the slogan "Just Stop It", a play on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  line "Just Do It".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union national secretary Tony Woolgar said it was important to raise public awareness of companies that sought to use the Olympics to enhance their public image. He said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exploited cheap labour while it paid athletes such as golfer Tiger Woods $111.5 million to wear its apparel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With Indonesian workers earning just $US32 ($55) per month, Woods's sponsorship would pay 60,000 workers for two years," he said. "Looking at it another way, it would take an Indonesian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worker 33,000 years to earn Woods's endorsement."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Indonesian worker will be in Australia from September 2 to 16, with two days in Melbourne from September 9.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a response to criticism of its labour practices, the US-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  set up a program to monitor contracted production plants to ensure legal labour guidelines were met, naming it "Transparency 101".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has promised to make public the results, including external monitoring visits by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On its official website \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  says: "It is our sincere hope that this new step forward will lead to greater transparency in our industry and continuous improvement of global working conditions."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The skate and hockey-equipment manufacturer, owned by footwear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc., has already halved the number of its office employees to 30 in the last year, Kiedaisch said from Munich, where he's on business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recent developments have not been kind to Montreal as an ``oligopoly'' in the global hockey-equipment manufacturing industry, of which it controls about two-thirds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last week, it was disclosed that the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec pension fund manager appears to have called in a $136-million loan to Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief rival, The Hockey Co., revoking a previously agreed-to extension on the loan.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SHAREHOLDERS United have grave concerns about Manchester United's new record kit deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will replace Umbro as United's kit manufacturers from July 2002 in a 13 year deal with a staggering pounds 302.9million. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, Shareholders United are worried the Reds may be in breach of their own club charter because of the allegations that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  uses child labour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a letter sent to chief executive Peter Kenyon earlier this week, vice chair Michael Crick, wrote: "Article 1.6 of the new club charter says, 'Manchester United plc opposes the exploitation of child labour. No orders will be placed from suppliers employing child labour under the age allowed in the country concerned'. Shareholders United fully support this."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United's group marketing director Peter Draper tried to allay these fears, but Shareholders United remain to be convinced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shareholders group also fear that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have too much influence on United and may pressure the club into representing the American company around the world in various tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Spokesman Oliver Houston pointed out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  relationship with the Brazilian FA was being examined by the Brazilian government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "This is not just about the allegations of child labour and we're concerned that commercial pressure will be put on United.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "United went out to the Far East to play in a Pepsi tournament and who's to say that similar things won't happen with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Child labour claims fear
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER United were today being urged by shareholding supporters not to enter into a GBP 310m partnership with sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The fans say serious allegations over the American company's use of child labour could tarnish the club's credibility and contravene its new club charter.  Earlier this month it was revealed that United could sell off its whole retail arm to the company for GBP 23.3m over 13 years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Besides the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issue, shareholders were due to ask several tough questions of club chiefs at the Manchester United AGM today, including seeking an explanation as to how the disastrous appointment of PR chief Alison Ryan came about.  The club was forced to make an embarrassing U-turn over its job offer after it emerged she had lied on her CV.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Today Oliver Houston, spokesman for Shareholders United, said there were serious concerns over many aspects of the planned \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal.  We are not setting ourselves up as an anti-child labour campaign group but this deal seems to be in direct contravention of our new customer charter which states that the club will not deal with companies which employ it,'' he said.  There have been serious allegations over the years about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of child labour, most recently in a Panorama programme screened last month. We will be asking if we will have a get-out clause if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are found to be dabbling in child labour.  There are enough get-out clauses for them if we fall below half way in the league of fail to qualify for Europe. If we win the European Cup five times in a row, will we be able to ask for more money.  We are also concerned that selling your whole merchandising arm for GBP 23m a year might not be the best deal. We are worried the club has rushed into this and is in danger of committing another PR gaffe?''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shareholder United were also due to call for a wider range of ticket prices to make it easier for young people to watch matches and encourage a new, solid fan base.  There's no contradiction between wanting to have a greater range of ticket prices and wanting to have success,'' he said.  If the executives pay more and the kids pay less that will sustain a good customer base.'' Comment: Page 8

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods is making the switch to the swoosh. After testing a new ball during competition in Germany and in the Memorial Tournament, Woods said yesterday he will formally switch to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball when he plays the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in two weeks. Woods finished third in the Deutsche Bank Open, and then won the Memorial last week by five strokes. ''I think it's done pretty good so far,'' he said last week. The announcement officially ends a marketing conflict between Woods's top two golf sponsors - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist - that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market. Titleist argued that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was using Woods to promote golf balls because of two commercials - one that showed Woods bouncing a ball off his wedge, another that showed hackers on the range belting 300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up. CEO Wally Uihlein contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked Woods's deal so that he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have its logo on his bag and to use Woods in advertisements.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER UNITED have signed a world-record kit sponsorship deal with sport giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The world's biggest sports clothing manufacturer has agreed to pay the Reds GBP 309.9m over 13 years - a staggering GBP 23.3m a year.  But the deal could spark a legal battle with existing kit sponsors Umbro. United's contract with the Cheadle-based firm does not expire until the end of next season.  The unique deal, which begins on August 1, 2002, gives \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exclusive rights to sponsor United gear, manufacture and sell its merchandise, and operate the Reds' existing retail operations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will form a separate subsidiary company to deal specifically with United sponsorship matters and has pledged to invest GBP 1m a year in grassroots football.  Umbro executives are reportedly seething that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal has become public knowledge and are believed to have consulted legal advisers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sports lawyer Lee Brierley, a partner at law firm DLA in Manchester, said: Normally, these contracts have a clause in them which prevents the football club from announcing a new suplier before the end of the contract. Umbro will be looking at their contract and will have to prove that they suffered a loss in sales and profits.'' Some United shareholders are also unhappy about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal.  The Shareholders United group fears the firm will have too much influence on United and may pressure it into representing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  around the world in soccer tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Today, United's chief executive Peter Kenyon, who joined the Reds from Umbro, said: There's no question that anything will happen that will disrupt our contract with Umbro, which runs until 2002. After that, as and when we are ready to say something we will do so. But I just want to reaffirm that Umbro are our sportswear partners through to 2002.'' An Umbro spokesman said: Umbro has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Manchester United Football Club, but the current contract will not be extended beyond July 2002.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Duval is set to quit Titleist and join \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh squad in a deal that will rock the golf industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A five-year, GBP 16 million deal, which could double with bonuses, has already been agreed and the contract is expected to be completed early in the New Year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal will give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  two of the world's top three golfers - a similar length deal, but double the cost, having already been signed with No1 Tiger Woods. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The two good friends teamed up recently to win the World Cup for America in Argentina and, significantly, used the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball during the foursomes section of the four-day event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Duval has also been spotted wearing his new sponsor's shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A deal is understood to have been signed at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Oregon this week, but will not be completed until Duval's existing contract with Titleist is sorted out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It stills has more than two years to run and Titleist, already smarting because of the Woods abdication, could seek compensation from the company which is fast becoming a serious player in the golf market Titleist has long dominated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Duval's switch is expected to increase the intensity of that rivalry and extend the boundaries of the golf ball wars which Callaway, another of the industry's big guns, has recently joined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Neither company would comment on the deal yesterday, although an announcement is imminent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Duval, the world No3, is believed to have been peeved that when Titleist signed fellow top 10 players Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson to recent long-term deals, they did not renegotiate terms with him. Although Woods still plays a full bag of Titleist clubs, Duval's deal is understood to include clauses which tie him to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once they have manufactured a set to his specifications.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Duval is also expected to sign a new agreement with his management handlers IMG at the start of next year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although Duval has been hampered for most of the season by a back injury, he returned late in the year to win another title and emphasise that he is one of the few current players capable of mounting a serious attack on Woods' dominance of the game.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite all his setbacks Duval finished seventh on the PGA Tour rankings with GBP 1.5m in prizemoney.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS has been setting records on the golf course all summer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Now he is on the verge of an endorsement
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth 100 million dollars (\'a371.5million) believed to be the richest in sport. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agreed a five-year deal that will pay him an average of \'a314million a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract could be signed today, said his agent, Mark Steinberg.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He declined to discuss specifics of the deal,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  but said it was an
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "outstanding contract".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Steinberg added:"It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but what he has done for golf and sport,"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a record-smashing summer, Woods has become perhaps the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  biggest star in sport, with one magnificent achievement after another - three straight major championships, a scoring record in each one, and the youngest player at 24 to complete the Grand Slam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His latest triumph was winning the Canadian Open last weekend.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf president Bob Wood confirmed it was a five-year deal, but
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  wouldn't disclose details. He said the contract was tied partly to sales.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TIGER Woods used a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball playing the first round of the European PGA's Deutsche Bank Open today, a move that could signal the end of his shaky relationship with rival Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It could also make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, which has signed up several big-name golfers this year, a legitimate force in the equipment industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Woods said he hasn't decided whether to make the switch yet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I've been testing it for a few months -- basically I wanted a test round on the tour. If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my ball," said Woods, following his first round 2-under 70 playing with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods said testing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  under tournament conditions didn't violate his contract with Titleist, which pays him $3.5 million a year to use Titleist clubs and balls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was renegotiated last year after a dispute over A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial that showed Woods bouncing a ball off his wedge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An industry source said Woods has a clause in his contract with Titleist that would allow him to terminate it on short notice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Titleist declined to make an immediate comment, spokesman Joe Gomes said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Woods have been renegotiating his five-year, $70 million deal for more than a year and are close to a new contract, expected to at least double that amount. Those talks could be prolonged if Woods -- who wears only \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothes, shoes and hats -- decides to play its ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For Woods, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball has a similar feel to the Titleist he currently uses, but was better in the wind.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It flies a little bit different. It just seems to hold its lines better," Woods said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made a strong push into the competitive ball market this year, signing up players such as Paul Azinger, Notah Begay and British Open champion Paul Lawrie.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Let's say he does switch. That would be huge for us," said Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf. "Golf is a business where it's tough on the equipment side to break through. For him to play our product says a lot about it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Woods has been testing the ball since the beginning of the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The world No. 1 and the player who is chasing him for the US top spot this year, Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, shot 70s and are three strokes off the pace set by Miguel Jimenez after the first round of the tournament in Hamburg.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the first time in 98 tournaments around the world, Tiger Woods teed up a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball yesterday instead of a Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For Mr. Woods, using the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball in the first round of the Deutsche Bank Open in Germany was just an experiment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it was the loudest shot fired yet in the war between upstart \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and long-established makers of golf balls, such as Titleist, Maxfli and Callaway. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would love to claim its ball is used by the No. 1 player in the world and gain a larger slice of the lucrative golf equipment market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake,'' said Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a 2-under-par 70 that left him three strokes out of the first-round lead in Germany, Mr. Woods said he has been experimenting with a version of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball the past few months while practising at his home course outside Orlando, Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Basically, I wanted a test round on the tour,'' Mr. Woods said. ''If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my ball.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Woods has an apparel contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but a five-year contract with Titleist that pays him $2 million a year to use their clubs and balls. Industry sources have said he has an escape clause that would allow him to terminate that deal on short notice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist spokesman Joe Gomes said the company would not comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For Woods to change could be just what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs to move into the highly-competitive and highly-profitable golf-ball industry. The National Golf Foundation says Americans spent $820 million on golf balls in 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist has the largest slice of the golf-ball pie - - about 50 per cent. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market last year with limited success, and this year signed up 14 touring pros to use its ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''People who enjoy golf talk equipment -- what irons you just bought, what balls you play,'' said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Mr. Wood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''For us to become a great golf brand, which is our desire, we feel it's really important to have a foothold in the equipment business.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has ordered a popular style of football shirt off Hong Kong shelves over claims they may contain a toxic chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A "couple of hundred" of the yellow and black shirts - part of German side Borussia Dortmund's home strip - have been sold to soccer fans, who were yesterday advised not to wear them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The alert followed a German television report that the jerseys contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chemical is also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, but British and Dutch tests show it causes mutations in marine snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At high levels in humans, tributyltin is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  William Chong Kam-fu, product line manager for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hong Kong, said all of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makers were barred from using the chemical, but that tests were being done to check the safety of the shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said about 20 sports shops in the SAR carried the shirts and all had been asked to withdraw them from sale as a precaution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  We cannot prove now whether the story by German TV station ARD is valid, Mr Chong said. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Germany has conducted its own test with all the Borussia Dortmund jerseys and the result is there's no tributyltin found in them."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company will carry out a joint test with the TV station. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotline is 2751 4988.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER Woods threw a potential $150 million contract into jeopardy yesterday by choosing to join the ranks of thousands of striking minor league actors instead of shooting a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was due to shoot the latest ad in a popular series featuring the golfing superstar when Woods announced he was supporting the Screen Actors Guild's campaign to get better pay for commercials. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it," his agent Mark Steinberg said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' sponsorship deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is being renegotiated, with industry commentators predicting he could easily earn up to $150 million over five years under the new deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The extraordinary popularity of his ads, particularly one in which he expertly bounces a golf ball on a club head, ensures \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  probably will not complain too loudly about Woods' no-show at the scheduled shoot at his home course near Orlando, Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the company was clearly concerned the ad, which it had hoped to release on June 15 to coincide with the start of the US Open, would not be finished in time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Mike Kelly said it was unclear when Woods would be available for a new shoot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The last I heard it was to be rescheduled," Kelly said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger's schedule is pretty hectic so it's hard to say. It may be a couple of months, it may be a couple of weeks."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' move ensured the strike, which involves 135,000 actors but so far has attracted limited attention, was thrown into the headlines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We deeply appreciate the support of this international superstar," SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE MOST DISAPPOINTING news of the week was that Tony Blair should take time out from the UN millennium summit in New York to chat about transfer fees with fellow European leaders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For Blair to be concerned about something as trivial as football transfers during a conference dedicated to freeing people from the scourge of war and striving for an equitable world is doubly worrying. First, it betokens a lack of perspective. Surely the people of Rwanda have slightly more pressing concerns than those afflicting an advantaged minority fretting over their contract details. Second, it is an ugly sign that football might become an election issue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Labour will go all out for footie-related photo shoots however crass. The Tories, meanwhile, will toe the Rangers line: in Europe, technically, but not for very long nor in any meaningful sense.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shame of it is is that Blair needn't have bothered. Red cards were the first burning issue of this nascent football season, transfers the second, but the world has moved on. Now, the talking point is the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As Silvinho proved at Stamford Bridge, it curves, it swerves, it busts the net. It's almost as if those clever peo ple at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have affixed some magnetic device within it to ensure an all-singing, all-scoring, all-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -boot-selling game.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So far this season there are 3.14 goals in a Premiership match - way above average. The goalies are disconsolate. Everton keeper Paul Gerrard says: 'There is a difference between the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball and the Mitre ball we used last season. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball is lighter and it moves through the air a lot faster. It also swerves like hell.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'The Mitre ball was heavier and it had a truer line through the air. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swerves all over the place, but the one advantage for keepers is that you can kick it further. My goal-kicks are reaching the other penalty area at times and that's a good thing.' Certainly for Everton fans who, with Duncan Ferguson injured, were beginning to wonder where the goals might come from.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Seaman, a goalkeeper who is an excuse short of an explanation, cannot agree fast enough.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'It's an exciting season but not for the goalies. . . There are a lot of goals going in and a lot of strange ones at that. I saw Benito Carbone's against Chelsea. People slagged off Ed de Goey but that ball has gone all over the place. It can make you look a fool. There is a massive difference. It's like one of those balls you buy on the beach for a quid. It moves around from side to side and everywhere.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Manchester United coach, Steve McClaren, chimes in: 'They have done certain tests and it moves through the air faster. Our players have noticed that it does fly.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Something is clearly up, so I confidently predict that you will hear 'Oohhh yesss, that surely must be a contender for goal of the season' at least a dozen times between now and the end of the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They said what. . .?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'Yes, it is fun to be playing but I don't like U.S. Open so much. Transportation bad, food bad, locker room bad. Big tournament that's OK. But this place is little bit crazy.' Elena Dementieva, the 18-year-old Russian, is thrilled to make the semi-finals of the U.S. Open, but isn't crazy about the Open itself.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been criticised for using Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in a commercial featuring the word "sorry" 15 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman plays only a minor role in the ad but the timing of its release has stung Aboriginal activists. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  National Sorry Day Committee chairwoman Audrey Kinnear said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to exploit the Aboriginal reconciliation process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She said the continuous use of the word "sorry" trivialised the issue of whether the Federal Government should apologise to Aborigines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using 'sorry' in so many ways and so many times, they are actually trivialising what 'sorry' stands for," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has used 20 mainly Olympic athletes who apologise to family, friends and workmates for an obsession with sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, say sorry in a light-hearted manner for being driven by success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Teenage runner Georgie Clarke apologises to her school friends for training instead of walking home with them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Embattled spin-king Shane Warne says sorry to Dennis Lillee, in a reference to breaking Lillee's wicket-taking record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman does not actually say sorry but turns to the camera and says, 'Can we talk about this later?" before running off.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympics spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the timing of the commercial was purely co-incidental. Ms Ryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to show how athletes had to apologise to a lot of people they did not have time for during Olympic preparations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Whilst we understand there is some sensitivity and contention around the 'sorry' issue, it was a more behind-the-scenes look at athletes who make no apologies for the fact they have to say sorry to a lot of people," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Sorry is word used by people every day."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Ms Kinnear said Aborigines were offended that Freeman was being "used" to capitalise on the reconciliation debate.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Air Weatherspoons anyone?
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  just discovered that women, too, wear sneakers, and some are even stars, like the New York Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an effort to sell more athletic shoes and jog bras in an increasingly competitive marketplace, the maker of Air Jordans said yesterday it would soon barrage the market with high- and moderate-priced items for sports-minded women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By creating a new division and moving around some its top executives, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it wants women's shoes and clothes to eventually generate a third of the company's sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the year ended in May, women's sales of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  goods amounted to $1.55 billion, or about 20% of its worldwide total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  women's business is one of our major growth accelerators in the U.S. and internationally, making it one of our company's top priorities," chairman Phil Knight said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the growing popularity of women's professional basketball and the popularity of prominent female Olympians such as track star Marion Jones, the interest in women's sports and fitness is soaring.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other manufacturers have had the same idea, and already own a slice of the market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Polo Ralph Lauren and even luxury label Prada have made a strong foothold in the women's athleticwear market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Customers appear to prefer their more fashionable, and less gym class-looking clothes, analysts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Clare Hammill, who was most recently involved in the upcoming launch of the Techlab line of sports accessories, was named vice president, women's business. The sports-inspired Techlab products include a speed and distance monitor, a heart rate monitor and a two-way radio for runners and other athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wall Street reacted coolly to the new women's division - perhaps concerned about the costs of developing new products and promotion - sending \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stock down more than 10% yesterday. It fell $4.75 to $42.13, right in the middle of its 52-week range of $25.81 to $59.25.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition to concerns among investors, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also continues to face protests over its use of factories in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Indonesia, where workers are paid a mere fraction of what an average Air Jordan might cost.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the largest private employer in Vietnam, with a work force of more than 45,000 at five factories owned and operated by contractors from South Korea and Taiwan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently, Knight sent a scathing message to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, pledging to withhold future endowments because of student protests of his company's overseas manufacturing record.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ASSOCIATED PRESS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fresh off his record-breaking summer of golf, Tiger Woods is on the verge of signing a $100 million (all figures U.S.) endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be the richest in sports, The Associated Press has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, declined to discuss specifics of the deal yesterday, only to say it was an "outstanding contract."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are within days of a signature," he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but what he has done for golf and sports."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' previous contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was said to be $40 million (U.S.) over five years. He was used heavily in their advertisements and established his own line of clothing and shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A source close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, described it as the "largest contract in sports marketing history," worth about $100 million over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There are so many different revenue streams," the source said. "It's impossible to calculate what the end result will be."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood described the contract as "pretty creative."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not often you get a chance to work with somebody who's the best in the world at what they do," he said. "Working with and being associated with Tiger Woods has created an incredible amount of positive energy about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While Woods also declined to discuss contract details, he did say the amount was partly tied to sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods has represented \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since turning professional in 1996. In just four years, he has won all four major championships, becoming, at 24, the youngest player to do so. He set the scoring record in each of them, and he has attracted a record number of TV viewers just about every week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In June, he gave \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a huge lift when he switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball. He went on to win the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach by 15 strokes, the largest winning margin in the 140-year history of major championship golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president said its market share for balls has increased from about 1 per cent in April to nearly 4 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also is considering a move toward golf clubs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Earlier this year, Woods signed an endorsement deal with Buick worth $30 million over five years and carries its logo on his bag.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger Woods was yesterday forced to run the gauntlet of about 100 sacked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  employees who staged an angry protest inside the lobby of the Bangkok hotel where he is staying.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The world's top golfer, who arrived in the Thai capital to play in the Johnnie Walker Classic, was leaving a ceremony inside the building where he had been conferred with an honorary doctorate in sports science.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods, whose mother is Thai, would have been expecting a warm welcome to the land where he has been hailed as a hero during past visits. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But this time he had to be escorted through the noisy protesters by a phalanx of bodyguard and officials as he returned to his room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Looking somewhat taken aback, he put his head down and walked past without making any comment as the protesters shouted questions at him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organisers said Woods, whose contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nets him $ 100 million over five years, should listen to their claims that they have been unlawfully dismissed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Thailand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He should be able to really understand why that company can give him so much money," said Thai Labour Committee official Lek Junya Yumprasert.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It would take the workers here 72,000 years of work for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on their wages here to make that money," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The demonstrators said they were part of a group of 1,016 workers who were still waiting to be compensated a total of 41 million baht ((pounds) 853,000) after being laid off by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in September.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carrying placards reading "Tiger Woods putting around workers rights" and "Tiger Woods please help us" the workers gathered in the foyer of the Shangri La hotel and resisted attempts by hotel staff and Woods's entourage to shift them.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which unions say employs roughly 70,000 Thais, has frequently been accused of ill-treating its Asian employees. It is charged with subjecting them to inadequate pay and poor working conditions, as well as banning union membership.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the degree ceremony, Woods said it was a "tremendous honour" to be recognised for his sporting and charitable achievements. "This is a humbling experience," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 For the first time in 98 tournaments around the world, Tiger Woods played golf Thursday with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  instead of a Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the latest and loudest shot fired in the golf ball wars, Woods experimented with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball in the first round of the Deutsche Bank Open at Alveslohe, Germany, leaving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf hopeful it could use his massive appeal to grab a greater share of the market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake," said Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whether either happens remains to be seen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods said he has been experimenting with a version of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy the past few months while practicing at his home course outside Orlando, Fla.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Basically, I wanted a test round on the tour," Woods said. "If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my ball."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods is under contract with Titleist, but industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said he has an escape clause that would allow him to terminate the deal on short notice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's in my contract that I can try any ball," Woods said. Under his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract, Woods wears clothes, shoes and a hat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 OUTTA MY WAY
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods had some words of advice on how to handle an unruly German crowd that followed him during first-round play at the Deutsche Bank Open.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With Spanish Ryder Cup player Miguel Angel Jimenez holding a one-stroke at 5-under par 67 over a trio of players, Woods overcame bogeys on his first two holes Thursday to finish three back with a 70 at the $2.3-million-US event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Woods, the star attraction despite the appearance of the entire European Ryder Cup team at the event, had to deal with flash bulbs going off during his swing and spectators wandering on to the fairways.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The problem can be solved very easily. In the States we have a one arm length rule, one away from the ropes," Woods said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Here it's a little bit different. They walk in the middle of the fairways and stand right in front of you."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 COOK'S SPECIAL: EAGLE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Cook scored an eagle to give him the first-round lead Thursday in the Colonial at Fort Worth, Tex. His 4-under-par 66 put him a stroke ahead of a group of eight players, including Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cook holed a nine-iron shot from 127 yards for an eagle-2 on his 15th hole, the 393-yard 6th.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was 12 feet short and then spun toward the hole," Cook said. "It kind of went in like a putt. From what I've been seeing this year, I could see that thing bounce over the green."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DUVAL SICK
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Duval withdrew from the Colonial about an hour before he was scheduled to tee off.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval has been feeling sick since Monday night, and did not play in Wednesday's pro-am event at Colonial Country Club.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Duncan Campbell in Los Angeles
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sportswear manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has withdrawn millions of dollars of sponsorship from three American universities because of the activities of campus-based anti-sweatshop groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The move is the latest in a running battle between leading multinational firms and the student anti-sweatshop movement which has mushroomed on campuses during the last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the past three weeks, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has withdrawn from financial arrangements worth more than $ 50m ( pounds 30m) with the University of Oregon, the University of Michigan and Brown University. The sports firm had provided free equipment for the universities' sports teams and had made large donations and endowments. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  objects to the demands being made by the Workers Rights Consortium, a body made up of students, university and union officials, and human rights campaigners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The WRC, which campaigns for improved working conditions in countries which pro duce clothes for the western markets, supports unannounced visits to factories and minimum working conditions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has said it provides better working conditions than its competitors and makes a conscious effort to ensure that its factories operate fairly and humanely. The company supports another monitoring group, the Fair Labour Association, which the WRC claims is dominated by companies and does not carry out tough enough inspections.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Last month Phil Knight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman and founder, announced that he would not be making a $ 30m donation to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, because the company considered the WRC, which has branches in nearly 50 universities, unfriendly towards business in general.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has also accused the WRC of being a tool of the US unions, which have been unhappy at seeing manufacturing jobs go abroad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since then, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has broken its links with Michigan and Brown universities. The company equipped the Michigan athletics teams in a deal worth around $ 22m over six years and the men's and women's ice hockey squads at Brown.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Michigan is now negotiating with other sports manufacturers, including Adidas, Puma and Reebok. One Michigan athlete was quoted as saying: 'The swoosh (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  logo) is just a symbol. The person makes the player, not the shoes.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The question of whether US manufacturers are using sweatshops at home and abroad has become an important issue in student politics. Last month, 12 university administration buildings were occupied by students objecting to the administration's investment policies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Increasingly, student bodies are demanding that the universities should only engage in 'ethical investments', and companies deemed to use sweated labour have been targeted in pickets and demonstrations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Such is the interest in the issue that the Museum of Tolerance in los Angeles has staged a special sweatshop exhibition, detailing the history of sweatshop labour and campaigns against it.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A GROUP of Manchester United shareholders have expressed grave concerns about the club's record kit deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The American sportswear manufacturer will replace Umbro as United's kit-makers from July 2002 in a 13-year deal worth pounds 302.9 million. However, Shareholders United are worried United may be in breach of their own charter because of allegations that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use child labour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a letter to chief executive Peter Kenyon earlier this week, vice-chairman Michael Crick, wrote: "Article 1.6 of the new club charter says, 'Manchester United plc opposes the exploitation of child labour. No orders will be placed from suppliers employing child labour under the age allowed in the country concerned'. Shareholders United fully support this."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United's group marketing director, Peter Draper, tried to allay these fears, but Shareholders United are yet to be convinced. The group also fear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have too much influence on United and may pressurise the club into representing the company in tournaments around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spokesman Oliver Houston pointed out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  relationship with the Brazilian FA was being examined by the Brazilian government. He said: "This is not just about the allegations of child labour; we're concerned that commercial pressure will be put on United."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The world's largest maker of athletic shoes said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 17 percent, led by sales gains in the United States and Asia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Net income rose to $ 145.3 million, or 52 cents a share, from $ 124.2 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter ended Feb. 29 fell less than 1 percent to $ 2.16 billion. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warned last month that retailers' plans to close hundreds of sporting goods stores in the United States --- where the company gets half its business --- will hurt earnings this fiscal year and next. Its shares have fallen 36 percent this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Worldwide orders for future deliveries rose 4 percent. Futures orders gauge demand for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes six months ahead of time and account for as much as 85 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sales, analysts said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Atlanta-based hotel operator warned for a second time in as many months that its fourth-quarter loss will be greater than expected as it faces charges of up to $ 75 million for fiscal year 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lodgian said it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss ''substantially greater'' than the 12 cents to 14 cents a share loss estimated in January, as a result of the charges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company previously forecast a loss because of lower-than-expected sales in November and December.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company was expected to have a loss of 13 cents, the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. It had a loss of 3 cents a share a year ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company said 1999 year-end results will include charges related to hotels the company is planning to sell, a valuation to account for goodwill, a provision for items related to litigation and other items, such as professional fees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lodgian said progress is being made in its plan to seek strategic alternatives for the company. An asset sale to pay off debt or a sale of the company are possibilities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company made the announcement after the market close Thursday. Shares closed down 6 1/4 cents at $ 3.62 1/2.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Thursday it is investigating charges that its jerseys for a popular German soccer club are laced with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical. German department stores weren't waiting and were pulling the shirts off shelves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The action followed a German television report that the yellow-and-black jerseys contained tributyltin, a heavy-metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an ideal additive for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the substance to cause mutations in marine snails. The World Wildlife Fund is calling for a global ban on it.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  EVERYBODY ELSE is doing it and now \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is doing it too: going digital, that is.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  From July, the sportswear company will offer a new line of sports-focused electronic accessories. Among the products being developed in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "Techlab", are a digital audio player, a hi-tech walkie talkie, a portable heart- rate monitor and a watch for Alpine sports enthusiasts that features a compass and altimeter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Clare Hamill, vice-president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  equipment business said: "Athletes are demanding more information. Our mission is simple: to lead the convergence of sport and technology."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Symbolic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  new departure is its portable sport audio (PSA) player based on MP-3 technology. With research showing nearly two-thirds of people who buy portable music players using them during workouts and other leisure pursuits, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believes it makes sense to offer a product that, unlike portable CD players, has no moving parts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The PSA is built around a 64-megabyte chip that holds up to 120 minutes of digital music files. They can be downloaded from the internet or converted from CDs and because MP-3 is chip-, not disc-based, it is power efficient, light and can't skip. Unlike Diamond's popular Rio model, however, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  product will be oval in shape, allowing it to fit into a pocket or be worn on the body.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For snow-boarders and other Alpine sport enthusiasts, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have the Ascent Compass, a wrist piece that combines altitude, weather, thermometer and navigation functions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For joggers, the Oregon-based company will update its Triax ergonomic running watch with a new 100 model that offers heart rate information, a full chronograph and lap timing. Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wouldn't provide sales projections for the digital products, the company hopes to match the success of the original Triax watch, which has sold around 2.5 million units since its launch in 1997.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MEGA-RICH Manchester United may be heading towards a contentious fixture in the law courts over revelations that it has signed a multi-million pound kit deal with US leisure giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  United's current deal with Cheadle-based Umbro expires at the end of next season. But since news of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  link-up leaked out, Umbro has been weighing up the potential cost in terms of lost sales in replica shirts. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  No-one was saying anything publicly this week, either at Old Trafford or at Umbro's headquarters.  Within Umbro's own walls, however, executives are reportedly seething that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal has become public knowldge and it is believed they have consulted legal advisers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United confirmed in a short statement to the Stock Exchange last month that it was in negotiations with a major sportswear manufacturer.'' Further revelations were expected two weeks ago with the club's annual financial results. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , however, reportedly insisted on trying to keep the lid on the news as it was not then ready to complete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Speculation has valued the United-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tie-up at as much as GBP 20m a year over 15 years.  It was a week of glum news from the High Street. Arcadia, the troubled clothing retailer announced it was closing 55 stores - on top of the 400 announced in April.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Arcadia made a loss of GBP 8.5m on sales of GBP 1.995bn after an exceptional charge of GBP 144m associated with the shake-up. Last year, the chain's profits were GBP 46.7m. Menswear was particularly badly affected. Chief executive John Hoerner, however, said he was heartened by the start Arcadia had made to the current year with like-for-like sales up 4.8 per cent in the first seven weeks of the first half.  Glum news, too, for Debenhams. The department store group reported a GBP 9m slump in full-year profits. But finance director Matthew Roberts insisted he was more than satisfied with the performance in the light of toughening conditions on the nation's high streets. Its Trafford Centre store had performed particularly well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Increased spending on the Internet, home shopping and advertising accounted for more than GBP 11m of Debenhams' budget.  We are pleased with our performance,'' said Mr Roberts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vince Carter and Sheryl Swoopes led the way as the U.S. Olympic men's and women's basketball teams outclassed their opponents Saturday in Honolulu.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The men were never really in danger of being outscored, and Carter kept them from being outperformed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter unleashed a series of highlight-reel dunks in the second half to answer an array of spectacular plays by a team of collegians as the Olympians beat the U.S. Select Team 111-74, winning their second exhibition team. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And fresh off helping the Houston Comets win their fourth straight WNBA title, Swoopes joined the U.S. women's team for its game against Brazil and led the Americans to a 75-53 victory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Swoopes, the WNBA's regular-season MVP, had 18 points and six rebounds. Lisa Leslie added 15 points and Yolanda Griffith 13 in the tuneup game for the Sydney Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The United States trailed early but turned to a tight man-to-man defense in the second half and pulled away.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 OLYMPICS:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consumer groups plan to protest against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before the Sydney Games, accusing the company of breaching labor standards. On Monday, anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  group NikeWatch plans to launch a report into workplace practices at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Indonesian factories, in which the group says workers are earning as little as 40 cents an hour to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products. NikeWatch is planning events in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide and a mock Olympic opening ceremony in the days before the official event. . . .

Defending champion Cory McClenathan stayed atop Top Fuel qualifying for the 46th U.S. Nationals, drag racing's most prestigious event. No one bettered the quarter-mile run of 4.655 seconds at a top speed of 317.57 mph that McClenathan posted Friday. Shirley Muldowney, making a return to NHRA competition at this event, is qualified 14th with a 4.779 at 306.53.

Poland also found a new talent in a 3-1 win at Ukraine as Nigerian-born Emmanuel Olisadebe scored twice in Kiev to disappoint a crowd of 50,000. In one of the day's biggest upsets, Norway, which reached the second round of the World Cup two years ago, was held to a scoreless tie at home against lightly regarded Armenia. In an exhibition game, England played a 1-1 tie at France as Michael Owen scored in the 85th minute in Saint-Denis, France.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Manhattan doctor who tripped and fell while jogging filed a $10 million suit against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday, saying her sneakers were so badly designed, they caused the spill.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Deborah Faryniarz damaged a ligament in her wrist in the accident, which has left her career as an orthopedic surgeon in jeopardy, the suit in Manhattan federal court says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She was running on the East Side in a pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Certitude cross-trainers last April when a lace from her right sneaker hooked on a back leather tab on her left sneaker, the suit says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "She tripped, caught herself, and injured her right wrist," said her lawyer, James Kreindler. "She didn't trip on her shoelaces -- her sneakers had a defect that caused her to trip."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kreindler said the company eventually changed the unsafe sneaker's tabs, making them of soft plastic less likely to snag a lace.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials could not be reached for comment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TESTS were carried out yesterday on Rangers football strips after it was claimed similar shirts supplied by sports giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could contain a harmful toxic substance, writes William Tinning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sports goods manufacturer yesterday insisted there was no evidence that some of its British-made football shirts contained a chemical used on the bottom of sea vessels, which is also used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The claim was made by a German television show which commissioned laboratory tests on shirts supplied to Borussia Dortmund.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The show claimed to have found traces of Tributyltin (TBT), which is said to cause mutations among sea creatures. It is also thought high levels of TBT in humans can cause neurological problems and damage the immune system and liver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Ibrox club has sold 250,000 replica \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strips since last July - 72,000 through its own outlets. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also makes shirts for Arsenal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman yesterday said the Borussia Dortmund shirts were made by sub -contractors in Britain and strips for Rangers and Arsenal were made elsewhere.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER Woods joined a two- day-old strike by TV and radio commercial actors when he refused to film an ad for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The world's top golfer had been scheduled to shoot a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial at Islesworth Country Club, his home course near Orlando, Florida. But he decided not to do it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it," said his agent, Mark Steinberg.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods's decision was greeted enthusiastically by the Screen Actors Guild, which authorised the strike along with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. About 135,000 actors are represented by the unions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We deeply appreciate the support of this international superstar," SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods's deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was being renegotiated and could pay him a reported $US80-90 million over five years. The golfer's TV commercials, including one in which he bounces a golf ball off a club head, have been eye-catching.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Union membership is mandatory for anyone who appears in more than one commercial, athletes included. The unions have vowed to picket film shoots proceeding with non-union actors or guild members not honouring the strike.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The strike centres on the pay structure for commercials. Actors get a minimum of about $478 for a day's work and also get "pay-per-play" residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each time a spot airs on network television.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  When it comes to cable TV commercials, however, performers receive only a flat fee of $1000 or less for each 13-week, unlimited run.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors are demanding pay-per-play be extended to cable as well. But advertisers want to extend the flat fee from cable to the networks.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Vince Carter denied an Internet report Tuesday that he has reached agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on a six-year, $30 million ($44.5 million Cdn) endorsement contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's no deal. Everybody thinks they know everything that's going on with me. I'm tired of it, really," Carter said at the U.S. Olympic basketball team training camp. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I just got out of a Puma suit, so how can I have a deal ready?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Everybody's jumping the gun."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Toronto Raptors forward broke his contract with Puma last season, and an arbitrator recently ruled that Carter owes the company $13.5 million, plus $1 million in legal fees. The Web site HoopsTV.com reported that Carter's deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was agreed to, but a lawyer for Puma also disputed that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There isn't anything pending," said the lawyer, Norman Oberstein.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're just trying to work things out, and hopefully we will."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talks are progressing "satisfactorily," Oberstein of the Los Angeles law firm Oberstein, Kibre and Horowitz told the Canadian Press.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sales have slumped in recent years for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the king of shoe marketing, and its stock prices have fallen about 29 per cent over the past 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Signing Carter, the NBA slam dunk contest champ, would be a major coup for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , giving the shoe giant perhaps the NBA's most popular and dominant player to market its products since six-time champion Michael Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quoting anonymous sources, the Internet report said between $18 and $20 million of the $30 million will go to Puma to free Carter from his previous shoe contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oberstein said Carter would need permission from Puma to negotiate with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When asked if Puma had granted him that permission, he refused to comment, saying only that any agreement would be announced promptly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said the three sides were ironing out the final details of the deal, with Puma demanding a cut of royalties generated by Carter's future with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Eric Oberman refused to say whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been negotiating with Carter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't comment on rumours or speculation and we have absolutely nothing to announce at this point," Oberman said in a telephone interview from Portland, Ore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter's agent, IMG's Mark Steinberg was travelling and unavailable for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HoopsTV.com is a 24-hour basketball news and entertainment Web site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter is in Hawaii training with the U.S. basketball team, the so-called Dream Team, for the Sydney, Australia, Summer Games which begin Sept. 15.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    The government is planning to replace its stock of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules surface-to-air missiles, which, due to their advanced age and tendency to misfire, have become a liability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Defense Ministry has reflected costs in replacing the missiles in defense budget and will decide on the new type of SAM by June next year,'' said an official at the National Assembly Defense Committee. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The type of missile the ministry is considering introducing is the U.S.-made PAC-3, the newest version of the Patriot missile, or the Russian-made S-300, the official said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The official explained the need for a new missile.  Though inter-Korean cooperation and reconciliation have been taking shape on the Korean peninsula, a supply of dependable surface-to-air missiles is necessary for failsafe national defense,'' he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER Woods threw a potential $150 million contract into jeopardy yesterday by choosing to join the ranks of thousands of striking minor-league actors instead of shooting a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was due to shoot the latest ad in a popular series starring the golfing prodigy when Woods announced he was supporting the Screen Actors Guild's campaign to get better pay for commercials. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it," his agent, Mark Steinberg, said in a brief statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' sponsorship deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is being renegotiated, with industry commentators predicting he could easily earn up to $150 million over five years under the new contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The extraordinary popularity of his ads, particularly one in which he expertly bounces a golf ball off a club head, ensures \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will probably not complain too loudly about Woods' no-show at the scheduled shoot at Islesworth Country Club, his home course near Orlando, Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the company was clearly concerned the ad, which it had hoped to release on June 15 for the start of the US Open, would not be finished in time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Mike Kelly said it was unclear when Woods would be available.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The last I heard it was to be rescheduled," Mr Kelly said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger's schedule is pretty hectic so it's hard to say. It may be a couple of months, it may be a couple of weeks."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' move ensured the strike, which involves 135,000 actors but so far has attracted limited attention, was thrown into the headlines.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ALEX FERGUSON may turn his back on Manchester United when his contract expires in two years time and join forces with the sportswear manufacturer, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who is head-hunting him to to become its football ambassador.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talks between the United manager and the United States-based company are at an advanced stage and Ferguson may sign a lucrative deal shortly. "I've got a lot of offers already," Ferguson said. "One offer I've got is really staggering. It would be a four-year contract for a huge amount of money and would involve a lot of travelling. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I have to ask myself how much I want to do once I retire. I do want to protect some time, to be able to travel and so on. The way it is looking at the moment, I'm going to have to refuse a lot of people and just take on enough to keep me active and happy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson has been targeted by the firm as an ideal man to front its push for top football contracts with clubs and players worldwide. The salary being discussed is around pounds 1m a year for four years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may even be willing to offer Ferguson the job on a part-time basis, leaving him to keep other interests in football and horse racing. However, it would be too demanding a job to allow Ferguson to work at United in a significant capacity and will be the end of his association with the club if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is successful in its move.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson is intent on retiring from Old Trafford when his present contract expires. Despite United's new chief executive, Peter Kenyon, claiming that he would like him to stay, talks with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are ongoing and progressing well. Ferguson's affairs are being handled by a Manchester-based agency and he is extremely interested in the job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  already has several top footballers and clubs on its payroll. But in a competitive market it wants to stay ahead. With United's fame and his own reputation, Ferguson could open doors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by finding the best players and talking to clubs about signing up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ironically, United's kit is manufactured by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rivals, Umbro, a deal that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has coveted for years. Now, however, the fight is between United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for Ferguson's services - and at present the sportswear company is favourite.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson would like to remain involved with United while pursuing other interests, such as his work with Uefa. "I'd like to stay involved. I'll certainly keep going to matches and I'll carry on living in the area," he said. "Some people ask if I'm looking forward to being able to move back up to Scotland. 'You must be joking' I have to tell them - it is too bloody cold up there! I'll certainly carry on with the Uefa working party I'm on."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson repeated his intention to stand down as manager and he feels United may change the coaching set-up when he goes. "They'll probably change it and probably have a first-team coach," he said. "I thought it was important to announce well in advance the point at which I would stop doing the manager's job and to allow the club to look ahead."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Protesters took control of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Web site yesterday and redirected visitors to a site urging organizations to gather at and disrupt a world economic summit meeting planned for later this year in Australia.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the footwear company, said the action made its site inaccessible for up to 7 hours to some visitors starting at 10 a.m. Eastern time yesterday -- and the company said it was working with law enforcement officials to determine the group responsible for the attack. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We don't think it'll be too hard to find out who did it," said Corby Casler, a company spokeswoman, adding that it is unclear whether the company or government would be able to take any action in response to the attack. "Knowing who did it and being able to prove it are two different things."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms. Casler said that the Web site that was attacked is the main e-commerce site for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but that it was too soon to tell whether the company lost revenue, and, if so, how much.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  though it has come under attack for its treatment of workers at overseas factories, which critics say are sweatshops, is not the first to have its Web site redirected or defaced by so-called hacktivists. Groups opposing a variety of corporate and government activities have increasingly taken to cyberspace to put their own messages in place of an institution's Web site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In this case, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site was redirected to a site of an organization called S11 Alliance, based in Australia. On the site, the group is described as a network of groups and individuals concerned about "the growth of corporate power and the direction of globalization." .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is unclear if S11 was involved in the actual redirection. E-mail inquiries sent to S11 were not returned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The organization's Web site calls for protesters to use nonviolent means to shut down the World Economic Forum 2000, a gathering of economists, academicians, executives and government officials, to be held on Sept. 11-13 in Melbourne, Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The site does not specify particular grievances against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  except to include it on a list of World Economic Forum participants, along with companies like Exxon Mobil, Honeywell, McDonald's, Phillip-Morris and Amazon.com.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is used to dealing with this type of thing," Ms. Casler said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A BLACK \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  T-shirt gave police the vital clue in tracking down three youths suspected of stealing 25 vehicles for joyrides over the last few months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the youths, an 18-year-old, had provided the investigation team with valuable video footage. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Senior staff sergeant Kumar Vellasamy, one of the team members, said: "The suspect was caught on closed-circuit security camera wearing the T-shirt."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The youth was also spotted wearing the same T-shirt at various crime scenes in the Jurong area and when loitering in carparks with his accomplices, aged 21 and 22.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All three are believed to have started their crime spree from July.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police said they had used duplicate keys to break into the vehicles -- mainly old cars and vans -- at public carparks in Jurong, Boon Lay and Chua Chu Kang housing estates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They took the vehicles for joyrides. If a stolen car ran out of petrol, they would abandon it and steal another one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it was the end of the road for them on Wednesday, when they were rounded up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A team of 11 officers from the Jurong Police Division arrested them at 11 am near a Jurong West block of flats.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stolen vehicles have all been recovered by the police.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police team's investigations led them to a petrol kiosk in Jurong West, one at which nearby residents had informed them was frequented by the three youths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And it was at the kiosk that police officers found the video footage of the 18-year-old culprit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NBC has dropped a commercial for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  featuring a female Olympic runner being pursued by a chainsaw-wielding man.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman said the ad, which was aired in the US over the weekend as NBC kicked off its coverage of the Olympics, had been pulled because of complaints. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We were fully prepared to react quickly", said spokesman Rick Gitter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NBC had accepted the ad "with some trepidation" and "subject to significant adverse audience reaction", he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The spot was part of a campaign with the theme "Why Sport?" promoting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sponsorship of the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a spoof of horror movies, the commercial featured US Olympic runner Suzy Hamilton being chased by a masked man through a house and then into dark woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She puts on a burst of speed and leaves the man panting in the dust.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As he drops his weapon, the words appear on the screen: "Why sport? Because you'll live longer".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There was no immediate comment from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but a spokeswoman for the ad agency told the New York Times that although it had expected complaints, it was unfortunate NBC had dropped the ads.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BUY.COM DOUBLES ON FIRST DAY: Buy.com Inc. shares almost doubled in its first day of trading after it raised $ 182-million. Shares in Buy.com, whose Web sites sell everything from computers to golf clubs, sold at $ 13 in the IPO. Its shares closed at $ 25.12 1/2. Buy.com sold the 14-million shares, or 11 percent of the company, to raise money to cover losses incurred while it expands. The company's euphoria was tempered when it was hit by what has become a rash of Internet vandal attacks. Buy.com said a deluge of false traffic blocked the site's use, similar to a three-hour crash of Yahoo Inc.'s site Monday. Electronic vandals also disrupted the Web sites of eBay and Amazon.com with similar assaults.

Reuters said it plans over the next four years to move its services to the Internet from its current satellite delivery system, targeting the estimated 40-million individuals who now view Reuters information on Web sites served by the company. The London-based company also said its 1999 earnings rose 9 percent, but it said its growth was hampered in part by Y2K computer concerns.

Sales fell 8.1 percent last year as people switched to dressier styles and stores cut prices to clear out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  surplus sneakers and clothes. Venator Group Inc. last month said it plans to close about 150 Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and Champs sporting goods stores, while Just For Feet Inc. said in October it would close about half the chain's 85 stores. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shares dropped $ 8.56 1/4, or 19 percent, to $ 36.68 3/4.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER UNITED enhanced their status as the world's biggest football club last night by confirming the game's largest ever sponsorship package, a 13 -year deal with the sportswear manufacturer, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth pounds 303m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The "strategic alliance", which starts when United's current kit deal with Umbro expires in August 2002, will make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the team's official sponsors and kit supplier and will also give it the global rights to all United merchandise and retail operations. According to a statement released to the stock exchange, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will also become "the operator of Manchester United's global retail operations". In practice this will involve \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spreading the United brand around the world. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal could be even more lucrative to United, who will get half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  net profits generated from the licensing and retail operations, providing they stay in the top half of the Premiership and play in Europe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To put the deal into perspective, it works out at pounds 23.3m a year for United. A statement from the club's plc said: "Manchester United intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes". This is likely to include spending on new players, wages and development of United's already extensive international set-up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal announced yesterday dwarfs the pounds 30m four-year shirt sponsorship deal that United have with Vodafone - itself a record when it was signed - and the only comparable arrangement is the sponsorship deal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have with the Brazilian national side. A spokesman for United appeased fears that United - like Brazil - would have to play an extensive programme of exhibition matches for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "United are likely to play some overseas games for commercial reasons," he said, "but there is no contractual commitment to do so".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will set up a subsidiary company to control the global operation, each appointing half the directors. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will appoint the chairman, who will have the casting vote, and the sportswear company will also have the option to terminate the deal after six years if it should wish to do so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and United will also launch a grass-roots programme aimed at young players, with the pounds 1m-a-year running costs funded by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sponsorship announcement came on the day that United's manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, said that he hoped his assistant, Steve McClaren, may succeed him at Old Trafford. "Steve has been brilliant since he came here," Ferguson said. "He has shown a willingness to learn. It is not my decision to make, but I would have thought all the credentials were there for Steve to take the job."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger Woods will cap his record year on the golf course with a new endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth about Pounds 70million that may become the richest individual marketing deal in sports history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The five-year agreement takes effect next year when his existing Pounds 28million contract expires. With so many years of playing ahead of Woods, 24, the new contract confirms the view of several American financial analysts that he will become sport's first billion-dollar man. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bob Wood, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf president, said yesterday that the size of Woods's recompense could increase during the life of the contract because it has been structured to pay him more as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf business expands. "The better we do, the better he does," the executive explained, without going into details.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract could become more lucrative than any of those signed with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by Michael Jordan, the retired star of the Chicago Bulls basketball team, Mr Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Jordan, 37, now president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards, is still coining money from his endorsement deals with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Gatorade and other companies. He remains ahead of Woods. Fortune magazine puts his net worth at $ 430million (Pounds 305million) compared with $ 150million (Pounds 105million) for Woods. Even this year Jordan will be ahead in endorsement income, about Pounds 50million to about Pounds 30million for Woods. But time is on Woods's side; he could still be playing in 30 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods has won three successive major championships this year, the US Open, the Open and the US PGA. He is the youngest player to conquer the Grand Slam (his three wins this year and the US Masters he won in 1997) and has won nine tournaments this year, the most on the USPGA tour since 1950. In advertising parlance, he is a head-to-toe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  man, wearing shoes, clothing, gloves and hats all bearing the firm's swoosh logo. He has also switched to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls, and their market share is up from 1 per cent to nearly 4 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Beckham is already a multimillionaire from playing and endorsements, though not in the Tiger class. SFX Entertainments, which represents the Manchester United and England player, would not discuss his income but analysts estimate that he has earned about Pounds 2million from playing and nearly Pounds 10million from endorsements for Pepsi, Adidas, Brylcreem, publishing, videos, games and clothing.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 received from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  13 pairs of track spikes, with "VJ II" embroidered
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 on the heel, to give to his teammates from Vallejo Senior High
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 School.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I wanted to keep his memory alive," Brown says of the request.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 James, 18, was a member of Prairie View's 4x400 relay team as
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a freshman. He competed in football and track at Vallejo and received
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a track scholarship to the Division I school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His high school friends have cut a CD in his honor, with proceeds

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is my way of getting through this," Brown says. "I'm

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She says James was buried in his Vallejo track uniform and she
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 first approached \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about a pair of shoes for the uniform.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 said the company felt the limited edition shoe for James' teammates
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 was an appropriate gesture to honor an elite athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It won't threaten the popularity of Air Jordans, but it's a valued

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  FORMER Brazil coach Mario Zagallo has denied allegations that sportswear manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  forced star player Ronaldo to ignore medical advice and play in the 1998 World Cup Final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I am no puppet," said Zagallo, who was testifying before a government commission set up to investigate corruption in Brazilian football. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ronaldo played in the final in Paris despite claiming he had suffered convulsions only hours before the game, which France won 3-0. The team's sponsor, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , has denied charges that it persuaded Ronaldo to play despite his health problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Zagallo, who was sacked after the final and now coaches Rio de Janeiro club Flamengo, told the commission that he had been ready to put Edmundo into the team when Ronaldo arrived 45 minutes before the game, begging not to be dropped and guaranteeing hit fitness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "He told me he was in perfect physical condition," Zagallo said. "He gave me the results of examinations taken by a French clinic, saying there was no problem. I picked the team. There was never any interference from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or the Brazilian Football Confederation. If there had been, I would have resigned."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He added, though, that on one occasion during the World Cup, the Brazil team had been forced to drive around Paris after training session to attend and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -sponsored event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the past year, Brazilian football has seen domestic chaos, poor results at international level and a series of scandals, one allegedly involving Wan-derley Luxemburgo, who was sacked as national coach in September.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT WAS not about race relations, deprivation or capitalism, but the riot still managed to leave one policeman injured, eight people under arrest and a shopping centre closed for the day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The issue that exercised the people of Leeds so much was, in fact, squeaky trainers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A BBC TV's Watchdog programme had claimed pairs of the new pounds 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air Max 95, which uses air bubbles as a cushion, had failed to lose an initial squeak, and left many viewers convinced they could exchange their shoes for a silent pair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dozens of customers arrived at the Foot Locker store, in the St John's shopping centre, on Friday clutching trainers - of all ages - and demanding new ones. Staff refused to comply, tempers became frayed and the police were called.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  By noon the shopping centre was closed. Police said yesterday that of the eight people arrested, three - a boy of 15, a 20-year-old man and a woman in her twenties - had been charged with public order offences and assault and a 19-year-old woman had been charged with public order offences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Foot Locker Europe, based in Holland, said a small number of the trainers had a manufacturing fault which had dislodged an air bubble, causing the squeaking.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If people bring them back and it is found that the shoe is faulty we will replace them, but it doesn't mean people can bring trainers which are four or five years old," a spokeswoman said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has pulled out of a factory in Cambodia after being caught up in a child labour scandal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Children as young as 12 are said to have been working seven days a week for just pounds 31 a month at the factory which manufactures clothes for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who this week offered Manchester United a world record-breaking pounds 300million sponsorship deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The claims were made by investigators from the BBC's Panorama programme who spent weeks filming undercover at the factory in Cambodia. They found at least one underage child had falsified papers to get a job. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Alerted by Panorama, horrified \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs in Britain launched their own investigation and discovered another underage child working there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokeswoman for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told the Sunday Mirror: "We are painfully aware of the situation at the June Factory in Cambodia. Panorama alerted us to the issues of child labour and informed us that at least one underage worker had falsified papers to gain employment at the factory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We immediately investigated, but as we have not seen the Panorama programme we cannot verify their findings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We did find another incidence of child labour ourselves. For this reason we decided to pull out of the factory because we do not tolerate child labour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The factory was already on probation because one of our audits discovered that they had been using too much overtime which is against our code of conduct. After reviewing the situation we have pulled out of the factory."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has pledged to carry on paying wages to the children, who have been expelled from the factory, as long as they stay at school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokeswoman for the BBC told the Sunday Mirror: "In a world where consumers increasingly demand that ethical business practice goes hand-in-hand with profit, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - a hugely successful international brand - markets itself as a company with a strict code of conduct."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has previously been the target of demonstrations in the US over its employment of Third World workers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In 1998 the company banned all of its 5,000 sub-contractors worldwide from using child labour amid public outcry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims to enforce the Code of Conduct with rigorous ethical audits and has already stopped contracts with 11 factories in four countries for failing to comply. It recently signed up to the United Nations Global Compact which aims to bring about "the effective abolition of child labour".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has agreed to adopt US Occupational and Health Administration standards for air quality inside factories, and to extend programmes to provide free education classes by 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  kits out some of the world's most famous and highly-paid sports stars, including both the American and Australian Olympic squads and the Brazilian football team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Golf sensation Tiger Woods, 24, recently signed a new sponsorship contract with the company worth pounds 70million. The five-year deal begins next year when his current deal, worth pounds 28million, comes to an end. Industry experts reckon it will help make him the first billion-dollar sportsman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With more than 21,000 employees worldwide and a further 500,000 people in Third World countries working for sub-contractors, the company has annual sales of pounds 1.8billion and profits of over pounds 140million.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A BIG part of the story, one that shouldn't come as a shock, has gone unreported. This on-going Erick Barkley/NCAA saga is rooted -- where else? -- in the cut-throat, flesh-peddling, basketball-corrupting, child-abusing sneaker business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maine Central Institute, where Barkley attended college (basketball) prep school, is a noted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mill, a school whose basketball program is funded by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It serves as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pipeline of young talent as they travel the now-standardized path between sneaker company-owned and operated summer AAU programs and sneaker company-owned and operated college basketball programs. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , naturally, owns the hearts and minds of St. John's recruits and coaches. And that places St. John's among the overwhelming majority of big-time college-basketball programs that couldn't successfully compete without both the payola and influence delivered by a sneaker company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sole Influence" is the most recent book exposing the sneaker cartel's insidious hold on basketball, starting at the junior high school level. A lot of good previous exposes have done; a lot of good this one will do. Exposing corruption and removing corruption are very different things.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sole Influence" authors Dan Wetzel and Don Yaeger identify Maine Central Institute as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  talent depot that warehouses players -- the academically deficient, those in need of stronger competition, those whose bodies could use an extra year to mature -- before they're delivered to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  colleges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the book, we read of a high school star, 6-foot-10 Wesley Wilson from California, "choosing" Maine Central Institute over Winchendon prep school in Massachusetts because Winchendon is a "an adidas school." MCI is "a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  school" and young Wilson belongs to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And the two most influential men in "amateur" basketball today are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  George Raveling and adidas' Sonny Vaccaro because they've got hold of their companies' checkbooks as the point men in service to what's serenely called "grass roots programs."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (Raveling, in a sustained disgrace, also is employed by Fox Sports Net as a college basketball commentator!)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Remember, if you want to know the real story in any sport these days, just follow the money. And we're not talking about a few thousand dollars that is alleged to have been paid illegally by an AAU/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  team mentor to fund Barkley's stay at Maine Central Institute prior to his stay at St. John's/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We're talking about millions of dollars pumped in annually by sneaker companies in the name of creating a status-symbol frenzy on the street, purchasing high school and college basketball programs and landing the next Michael Jordan while thoroughly corrupting amateur organized basketball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And that corrupt process begins the moment a mere child is identified by a sneaker agent as a potential "PTPer, baby!"

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GEORGE Steinbrenner is a remarkable man. Consider that he recognizes the latent mental disease within Darryl Strawberry, but he couldn't identify the clear and present kind in Howard Spira.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While it never made all the glowing obituaries attesting to his extraordinary qualities as a team and civic leader, Derrick Thomas, at the age of 33, left seven children by five women. And he was killed driving irresponsibly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In advertisements heard this week over WFAN, Mike Francesa encouraged listeners to get out to Aqueduct for tomorrow's Stymie Handicap. That's a good idea, horseracing fans, especially since Aqueduct results normally aren't given over WFAN.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a company press release, an off-shore, on-line gambling sports book based in Venezuela paid off at 8-1 in its "Next NBA Player To Be Arrested" proposition last week when Anthony Mason was pinched. (Heck, the best you could do around here was 5-1). The same press release lists Ravens' LB Ray Lewis at 3-5 to be found guilty of murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FAN's Russ Salzberg has fully endorsed Mike Jarvis' since-recanted position that the NCAA, in the Barkley case, has behaved like the Gestapo. "That's exactly what it is: Gestapo tactics," Salzberg said Sunday. Salzberg should've done a little research on the Gestapo -- maybe even spoken with a Holocaust survivor -- before making such a disgusting statement.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE latest tumult over the premature departure of a network from a live event -- Saturday, CBS dumped New York and ACC country out of Michigan State-Indiana with the game headed for OT in order to show the start of St. John's-Duke -- is one of those 50-50 calls that no network can hope to get right.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But networks can do a far better job softening such blows for victimized viewers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Saturday's case, CBS was able to delay, for a few minutes, the tip of SJU-Duke. And, as CBS Sports VP Mike Aresco has stated, had CBS chosen to stick with MSU-IU and that game had gone to a second OT, regional viewers might've missed the entire first half of SJU-Duke or had a double OT removed from view.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But that's little consolation to those who had invested two hours in the MSU-IU telecast, only to have it disappear at the start of OT.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While CBS, in this case, couldn't win, it would have diminished viewer angst by doing more to keep the abandoned game under constant surveillance:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 1) Provide steady score update graphics. 2) Provide a live insert -- even if only for a few seconds -- of the abandoned game in order to show audiences that you're staying on the case. 3) Most important, if the abandoned game is going down to the wire, as the OT in MSU-IU did, get back to show the final 30-40 seconds, live.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If anyone gripes about losing a few seconds of first-half action to the final moments in a tight game that had been removed from regional view after two hours, then the viewer, and not the network, becomes the unreasonable party.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CBS should have shown those who favored the end of MSU-IU that it felt their pain. They would have recognized that CBS was in a tough spot but the network would do everything possible to make nice. This is what ESPN was able to do last week when matches within its Match Play Championship golf coverage ran long.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maybe a network has to lose a 30-second commercial spot, or two, in order to do right by its audience, but it can be done.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a boy in the 60's I was one of those who, from time to time with a school or Scout group, visited the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site in Lloyd Harbor, which your writer notes was not equipped with those warheads.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fact that we were ground zero in the event of an attack, and that the world was nuclear, was not exactly unclear to us. And whether or not the missiles were nuclear-equipped did not, in my mind at least, did not signify much.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad was a shocker. This ad is not so far removed from reality and that's what scares me.I hope this ad is also pulled.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article compiled by Diana Kessinger (People column, Sept. 25) about Monica Lewinsky has a large factual error. The last paragraph states "Clinton's affair with Lewinsky led to his impeachment trial last year in the Senate. He was acquitted."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The truth is the United States House of Representatives impeached President Clinton. The United States Senate voted not to remove him from office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are far too many of us who followed the hearings and the trial to not know the truth. Is this an attempt to rewrite history?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I know from personal experience that you correct all factual errors on the back page of the front section of the newspaper. Surely you must realize by then the damage has been done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a time when I believed the media (printed and televised) reported all the important news correctly without incorporating the reporter's personal views into the article. Most of the reporting in the mainstream media is allowing the reporters personal views to be included in their articles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whatever happened to journalism, when the journalist wrote their articles just reporting the facts? Fox News Channel is fast becoming an important competitor for fair and balanced reporting.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I want to thank noted constitutional scholar Dave Wilcox of Walnut Creek (Letters, Sept. 26) for directing us to the historical literature contemporary to the drafting of the Second Amendment. Jefferson said, "I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations." (Virginia Constitutional Convention Proceedings, 6/6/1788.) Mason said, "To disarm the people is the best way to enslave them." (Elliott, Ed., The Debates in the Several State Conventions.) Madison, the amendments' author, describes "the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation." (Federalist 46.)These echoes from the past are important if you prefer individual freedom to nanny government. With scant differences between the political parties on most issues, if you responsibly own a gun it is sad but true that "D" stands for Democrat and disarmament.

Buddhist temples, iced tea defenses, no controlling legal authority, inventing the internet, love story, Love Canal. What a joke. Holding his dying sister in his arms at the '96 convention, vowing to fight the evil weed. Then he was loudly and proudly hucking it and shucking before enthused Tennessee tobacco farmers, policing Hollywood while living in the hip pocket of Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, fighting for the little guy while living off Occidental Oil, the argesse of Armand Hammer. Millions of dollars of illegal Chinese money are coming in and the crown jewels of nuclear defense are going out. Gore is at war with the automobile, seizing huge tracts of Western land and scorching the Earth with uncontrolled burns. He is so beholden to the idea that he would trap our urban poor in perhaps the worst schools on the planet. In deception, dodge and duplicity, indeed, Gore learned at the knee of his master, whom even his admirers concede was one of the best.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you for Jack Chang's Sept. 20 coverage of Concord City Council campaign finance and the pledge of candidates Marcus O'Connell and Jack Novak not to accept campaign funds from known special interests.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bill McManigal's entire $9,000 campaign fund (reported through June 30) consisted solely of $500 checks from people who do not reside in Concord.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marcus O'Connell's campaign is supported broadly in Concord. To date more than 90 percent of the donations received are from Concord residents, the rest comes from long-standing friends. Most donations are in modest amounts. All are from people who are concerned about our general quality of life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Al Gore has once again proven that actions speak louder than words. Gore promised this week to "free (America) forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Gore's actions have resulted in the opposite effect. Under Gore's watch, America has actually become more dependent on foreign oil than at any other time in history. Since 1992, our domestic oil production has decreased 20 percent while our oil consumption has increased 15 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These results should not be surprising since we have simply had no energy plan under the Clinton/Gore administration. And now, as this crisis approaches a head, Gore still refuses to speak honestly about this problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead, Gore wants to cover-up the problem by releasing our oil reserve, although this would permanently cripple our dependence on foreign oil. Gore's failure to act over the last eight years renders his promises empty.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Ernie Lorch, wearing a white turtleneck and an inscrutable grin, was in his usual seat - behind St. John's bench - for the Red Storm's win Monday against Connecticut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sold-out Garden was rocking, but Lorch, the director of the Riverside Church basketball program, sat like the hoops patriarch that he is, with bearing and dignity. Men with power and influence don't rant and rave, even when their team is upsetting the defending national champions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And Lorch, whose program receives funding, athletic equipment and attitude from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - the world's biggest athletic shoe company - has more power and influence than just about anybody involved with New York City hoops. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's the most important man in New York City basketball," said Sonny Vaccaro, head of grass-roots basketball for adidas, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  main competitor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Riverside's senior team almost always dominates the tournaments it plays in every summer. Former Johnnies Chris Mullin, Walter Berry, Malik Sealy, Mark Jackson and Ron Artest all played for Riverside. So did Jerry Stackhouse, Elton Brand and Kenny Anderson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Riverside is the Cadillac of traveling teams," said Dan Wetzel, co-author with Don Yaeger of "Sole Influence," a look at the impact of shoe companies on basketball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lorch and Riverside are fueled by the money the program receives from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , said Vaccaro.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blame Michael Jordan.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , adidas and other shoe companies have spent millions on youth basketball teams since the mid-'80s, when Jordan joined the NBA and signed on with the swoosh company. When the next NBA superstar comes along, a shoe company hopes he'll endorse its products because he's had a relationship with it since high school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The stakes are high. If \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gives you money, they expect you to win. Ernie is beholden to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Vaccaro said, who expects the same excellence from teams sponsored by adidas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lorch and Riverside refused to be interviewed for this story. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials George Raveling and Don Crenshaw did not return numerous phone calls, and other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials declined comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Wetzel estimates that Riverside, as one of the nation's elite traveling teams, gets up to $100,000 a year from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also outfits St. John's men's basketball team and its 20 other intercollegiate sports teams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lorch's drive to have the best team in the country, though, may have indirectly gotten St. John's in trouble with the NCAA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doug Cummings, the headmaster of Maine Central Institute, told the Daily News earlier this week that Riverside had paid for a portion of Erick Barkley's $20,000 tuition when St. John's star point guard attended the prep school in 1997-98.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a result, the NCAA could discipline Barkley, who was already benched for two games this season because he swapped cars with a former summer league coach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lorch has said in the past that he's given financial assistance and other aid to hundreds of kids since 1961, when the Riverside program was founded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I see nothing wrong with what he's done," Vaccaro said of Lorch. Instead, Vaccaro blames NCAA rules that punish kids who need a hand getting through high school and getting to college.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "What's his worst sin, he paid for a kid's tuition? That's not exactly a sin you burn in hell for," Vaccaro laughed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Lorch is as much pompous egotist as he is philanthropist, critics say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Several people have asked the News to keep them anonymous, then say horrible things about him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But even Lorch's harshest critics acknowledge that he's done a lot of good things for kids.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's not in this for money or anything like that," said one coach. "He doesn't need money. He's in it for the social power and the recognition. And I'm sure on some level, he enjoys helping a kid like Erick Barkley go from the projects to the NBA."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also has lots of unabashed fans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's a very nice and kind and honest man," said Patrick Cuffe, whose son Kyle, a star at Rice High School, will attend St. John's next year. "He treats kids with respect. He's a social worker. He's a decent man."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Still, Lorch is not just in this because he likes doing good deeds. The basketball program, started as a way for Riverside to reach out to its young neighbors in nearby Harlem, is now a business venture that has as much to do with religious offerings as it does the Knicks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's now Riverside-Dot-Com-International, Inc.," Vaccaro said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's Ernie's fiefdom. It has nothing to do with the church anymore. Ernie is a celebrity now, he's the man. This separates him from the rest of the corporate stiffs."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MICK McCARTHY called for the Mexican match officials to be red carded - after being cheated of a US Cup victory over America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the wettest and coldest June night in Boston for 50 years, the sodden Irish had to settle for a 1-1 draw after an extraordinary sequence of cock-ups brought the competition into disrepute.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  America 's equalising score was allowed stand after Mexican linesman Jose Ramos Rizo failed to flag a blatant offside - despite being directly in line with the incident. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TV replays confirmed that goal scorer Ante Razov was at least two yards offside when he took the final pass from Ernie Stewart.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McCarthy was close to pulling out of the game after floodlight failure delayed the game - played in the torrential rain and storm force gales that lashed Boston - for 20 minutes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  When the match eventually restarted, the home side almost snatched a winner when Rizo again waved play on despite an even more obvious offside.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It was blatantly offside, it was a terrible decision," fumed the Irish boss of the 68th minute equaliser."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I feel lousy to have been denied a victory in such circumstances. It was even worse that they showed a replay of the incident on the big screen immediately afterwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "All our players were able to look up at the scoreboard and see it. Trying to get them back concentrating on the game after they had seen it was very difficult.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't blame the Americans for taking the goal. I would have done the exact same. Where I have a problem is with officials who can't see a blatant offside.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "But what can you do? Before the game the fourth official came to me and told me he was a FIFA official. It was like he was warning me to behave myself."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McCarthy did his best to bite his tongue but his off the record comments to Irish journalists revealed his fury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Just three minutes later the lights went out and the saturated teams had no option but to return to the dressing room for 20 minutes while the power was restored.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I was close to telling the lads to get back into their clothes. At one stage we were told the delay might be for one hour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If it had gone on for another five minutes, we would have done something."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Who doesn't know Diddley?
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , that's who, as legendary guitarman Bo Diddley says in a suit filed in Manhattan federal court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Diddley says the sneaker company didn't give him squat after selling thousands of T-shirts with his image and the catch phrase "You Don't Know Diddley." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The line was originally used in a popular 1989 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad campaign, in which Bo Jackson, the pro baseball and football player, was told: "You Don't Know Diddley."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The musician was paid for the original campaign, but says the sneaky company started selling the shirts again last year - without giving him a cut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a clear case of the big bully picking on the little guy," said Margo Lewis, president of Diddley's management company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official Vada Manager said yesterday afternoon that both sides were working out a deal and that the company had offered Diddley between $10,000 and $15,000 in royalties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That is absolutely false," fumed Diddley's lawyer, John Rosenberg. "I've never negotiated in the press before, but you can communicate back to them that we find this proposal entirely unacceptable."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rosenberg said there had been a brief settlement discussion in March, but it ended quickly when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  refused to cough up a larger amount of money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company has made more than $200,000 selling the new batch of T-shirts, Rosenberg said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Diddley, 71, a blues icon for the past 45 years, filed the suit late Wednesday under his real name, Ellas McDaniel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm sorry that it's come to this, but what's right is right," Diddley said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit seeks at least $500,000 in damages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the papers, Diddley claims \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached him in 1999 and talked about a new marketing deal. But when the two sides couldn't agree on royalties, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  walked away, the suit says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Months later, Diddley discovered that Web sites and other retailers were selling the shirts, and had hawked far more than had originally been discussed.

Hurricane Debby, with winds close to 75 miles an hour, could reach southern Florida by Friday. While hurricane damage to orange groves is unusual, traders said they are concerned about any possibility that the crop will be smaller than the record some private forecasters have predicted. Frozen concentrated orange juice for September delivery rose 1.75 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 76.55 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PEROT LEAVES CEO POST: Ross Perot, the billionaire and former presidential candidate, stepped down as chief executive of Perot Systems Corp. and handed over the top position to his son.

A spokeswoman said health was not a factor in the decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BANK ONE PRESIDENT TO RETIRE: Bank One Corp. said president and former chairman Verne Istock will retire in September, six months after handing control of the company over to chief executive James Dimon. Istock, 59, was interim chief executive after the departure in December of John B. McCoy, who left after earnings dropped at the company's credit card division and the stock plunged. Dimon was hired in March to restore investor confidence in the stock and revive Bank One's earnings, which have fallen for four consecutive quarters. Bank One also said it will cut five outside directors from its board to streamline the company's decisionmaking.

Coremetrics, a data analysis firm, said it hid identification codes on the computers of Toys "R" Us customers to track their Internet browsing habits. The lawsuits contend the Web site violated federal law and its own privacy policy by failing to disclose that it shared customers' personal information with an outsider. Toys "R" Us and Coremetrics deny any wrongdoing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 COKE EXPEDITES BONUSES: Coca-Cola Co. said it will pay some workers half of their annual bonuses earlier than normal to boost morale after the soft-drink company cut jobs and faced lawsuits related to its employment practices. About 9,000 employees, or one-third of Coca-Cola's work force, will receive half of their bonuses by the end of the month, a spokesman said. Eligible workers include management and professional workers. This year, Coca-Cola fired 5,200 employees, or about a fifth of its work force, to cut costs. It expects to save about $ 300-million in 2001. Coca-Cola also agreed to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit with current and former black workers who alleged the company denied them promotions and pay raises.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If you feel a small pin prick in your conscience every time you see "made in China" on a toy or "made in Indonesia" on your trainers, then according to Naomi Klein you are part of a growing global awareness that the shiny goods made by multinationals are often produced on the backs of low paid, grossly exploited workers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Klein is an anti-corporate activist and a journalist and her engaging and lively book, No Logo, explores the way multinationals work, particularly in the garment and sportswear sectors, and how activists are forcing companies to be more transparent and fair in their dealings with their mostly Asian suppliers. The strength of her book lies in her research and in the countless examples she details of the disparity between brand image and the manufacturing process. Toys made by workers that are no more than children themselves, and well-known designer clothes made in sweatshop conditions by workers who could work for a full month and still not be able to afford the Tshirt they have just made. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She looks particularly closely at the sportswear giant, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who throughout the 1980s and 1990s built up one of the world's biggest brand names only to see it seriously undermined, thanks to several exposes of its manufacturing processes. In 1998, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charismatic CEO, Phil Knight, finally admitted that his shoes "have become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse". It was a shocking admission. After all, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is held up as the great example of successful marketing, the brand builder that companies all around the world strive to emulate. Through advertising and sponsorship it took the humble running shoe off the track and brought it onto the streets, creating a brand image that was so cool and covetable that kids were literally willing to kill for them. From the number crunchers' point of view the beauty for the company is that it isn't weighed down with all the cost and responsibility of traditional manufacturing techniques simply because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't own any factories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every single product is out-sourced in countries where wages are low by US standards and workers' rights are limited. At the time of Knight's public admission, workers in one Indonesian factory producing $ 100 trainers were being paid 80 cents an hour. Activists pressed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to double the wages at a cost to the company of $ 20 million, exactly what Michael Jordan is paid per year to promote \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Instead the workers got a small raise and the company bowed its corporate head and vowed to develop "an aggressive corporate responsibility".
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not alone. Klein paints a grim image of profit-motivated multinationals treating the world as a giant shopping mall, going from country to country looking for the best labour bargains without any sense of social or environmental responsibility. She describes a world where everything is branded or sponsored, from water to universities and rightly points out that we have reached such a point of corporate dependency that we can't imagine any event taking place without a corporate sponsor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Books by activists can so easily become leaden polemics but Klein is engaging as well as informative, while giving a broad cultural perspective. With her tongue firmly in her cheek she admits that anti-multinational activism is now so fashionable that it was to the 1990s what saving the whale was to the 1980s, and she acknowledges the irony of an anti-corporate book being published by Flamingo, an imprint of HarperCollins - itself part of a multinational. She has written an admittedly one-sided book that's as persuasive as any advertisement, which will cause readers to feel more than a little uncomfortable about our logo-driven world.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SAN FRANCISCO Tiger Woods endorses "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy" golf balls in TV and magazine ads, but he really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged Tuesday after being sued in federal court.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the balls Woods uses have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public. "Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball," Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros really use. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products: irons, putters and golf balls for tour players," Kelly said. "Slight specification and modifications need to be made to their equipment for their game."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly what their pros endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist, said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a "tweaked" version of a club, he said, a consumer could special order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Callaway Golf, said if one of its pros says he uses a certain club, that identical club is available retail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, didn't immediately return a call requesting comment on the lawsuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, a nonprofit group called Public Remedies Inc. claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was engaging in unfair business practices. It asks that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "ill-gotten gains" be restored to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Tiger Woods does not play the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf ball, but instead plays one with a different composition and performance characteristics specially made for him ... and not available to the general public," the suit said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group did not return repeated calls for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods officially switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball before the U.S. Open, the first of his three major championships this year. The move officially ended a marketing conflict between Woods' top two golf sponsors \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 U.S. Amateur
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SPRINGFIELD, N.J. A car salesman who once was a pro golfer and a collegian from Rhode Island shared medal honors at the U.S. Amateur, but the event lost one of its most recognized faces when 1997 champion Matt Kuchar didn't advance to match play.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reinstated amateur Jeff Wilson, the medalist at the recent U.S. Open, and Jim Salinetti of the University of Rhode Island topped the field of 312 players by posting 4-under-par 137 totals. Tom McKnight, a 1998 Amateur finalist, finished a stroke behind the leaders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Lower and Upper courses at Baltusrol yielded only seven sub-par rounds for 36 holes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Danville's Troy McKinley advanced to match play by shooting a 3-over 73 on the 7,116-yard Lower Course for a 4-over 145 total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pleasanton's Jason Boyd failed to advance, posting a 3-over 74 on the 6,887-yard Upper Course for a 9-over 150 total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also advancing to match play which starts today on the Upper Course, were Stockton's Ricky Barnes (140); Napa's Andy Miller (142), the son of NBC golf analyst Johnny Miller; Dixon's Nick Watney (142); and Los Altos' Charles Woerner (143).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Exactly 64 players made the cut at 5-over 146, marking the first time there has not been a playoff for positions in match play since the current format was started in 1979.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kuchar finished at 148 in missing match play for the second straight year. He had a 1-over 71 on the Lower Course on Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suisun City's Wilson, 37, who mostly hits ball at a range because of time constraints with work and two children limit his golfing, stayed in front with an even-par 70 on the Lower Course. He had three birdies and three bogeys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I really wanted to be the medalist when I started my round today," Wilson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Salinetti, 22, shot a 2-under 68 on the Lower Course.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McKinley will play Ben Curtis (142) today, with a tee time of 6:20 a.m. (PDT). Wilson will tee off against David Patrick (146) at 7:10 a.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Elsewhere
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Duval, still trying to recover from an injured back, withdrew from this week's NEC Invitational and probably won't play again until the Buick Challenge at the end of September. The injury forced him to miss the PGA Championship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Dave Renwick got married after the British Open and returned to work in the PGA Championship. But he was fired by Vijay Singh after Singh missed the cut in the PGA. The split came four months after they won the Masters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Woods' final round duel Sunday with Bob May was the most watched PGA Championship on television. CBS Corp. generated an 8.8 rating and a 21 share for Woods' playoff victory. The network estimated 38.5 million viewers watched all or part of the PGA, most since the event was first aired in 1958.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The LPGA Tour will move its season-ending event after its site for the past four years closed. The Arch Championship on Nov. 16-19 will be played at another site in Las Vegas or in Florida, after the Desert Inn Resort closed to make room for a new hotel owned by Steve Wynn.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE deal may delight the board and the fans, and have kids of all ages rushing to wear the trademark \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh, but the deal may not be universally popular with shareholders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will replace Umbro as United's kit manufacturers from July 2002 in a 13 -year deal with a staggering \'a3302.9m. However United shareholders are worried the Reds may be in breach of their own club charter because of the allegations that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  uses child labour. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a letter sent to chief executive Peter Kenyon earlier this week, Shareholders United vice chair Michael Crick, wrote: "Article 1.6 of the new club charter says, 'Manchester United plc opposes the exploitation of child labour. No orders will be placed from suppliers employing child labour under the age allowed in the country concerned'. Shareholders United fully support this."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United's group marketing director Peter Draper tried to allay these fears, but Shareholders United remain to be convinced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shareholders group also fear that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have too much influence on United and may pressure the club into representing the American company around the world in various tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Spokesman Oliver Houston pointed out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  relationship with the Brazilian FA was being examined by the Brazilian government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "This is not just about the allegations of child labour and we're concerned that commercial pressure will be put on United.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "United went out to the Far East to play in a Pepsi tournament and who's to say that similar things won't happen with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're also still awaiting the outcome of the Brazilian Parliamentary Commission on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interference. From a PR point of view it seems foolhardy to rush into this after the warning we gave them."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 College students continue to propagate the myth that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and other apparel companies contract out to foreign "sweatshops" where overworked and underpaid workers toil in unhealthful conditions. They are especially outraged by the recent decision by Phil Knight of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to withdraw a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon in protest of the school's decision to join the Worker Rights Consortium, a labor rights group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rather than condemn Mr. Knight, students should commend him. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Worker Rights Consortium, which was established last fall by students, unions and human rights groups, accuses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of failing to pay its workers a "living wage," ignoring safety concerns, and forcing employees to work overtime. But, comparatively speaking, conditions at third world factories where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  goods are made are remarkably benevolent. For example, a number of the plants have air conditioning in countries where it is a rarity. Some factories also have clinics that can be used by employees' families, who otherwise would have little if any medical care. Several others even have schools where workers' children can learn everything from reading and writing to biology and physics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A typical worker in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  factory in Vietnam makes about $564 a year, which may not seem like much, but is more than twice the country's average annual income. The employee turnover rate in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  factories in Indonesia is consistently below 2 percent, low even by American standards. Such loyalty suggests that workers do not have better prospects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many statistics cited by student activists are misleading and originate with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed the Worker Rights Consortium. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has a direct economic interest: the regulations advocated by the consortium would increase American companies' foreign manufacturing costs, thus encouraging them to abandon their operations abroad and manufacture products domestically instead -- employing union labor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Phil Knight has agreed to an open monitoring of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  factories through the Fair Labor Association, a group composed of consumer groups, corporations and universities that has been endorsed by the White House. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has said that many students have genuine concerns about working conditions abroad, and that the company recognizes that there is always room for improvement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, according to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman, "the way to get true reform is to have all the players at the table." The Worker Rights Consortium, on the other hand, has not prescribed clear goals or monitoring procedures, and does not yet have legal status as a nonprofit organization. It has been reluctant to include companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the dialogue, claiming that corporate participation of any kind threatens workers' rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While many students uncritically believe the Worker Rights Consortium, they ignore the fact that Phil Knight and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have championed the well-being of workers internationally. By trying to punish \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  these students threaten to impoverish the workers they claim to protect.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to Brackettville schools, along with baseball bats. "We wanted

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Lee Weinstein says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the campaign has put the town on the map, so to speak,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 tourism is not on the rise. "You'll see we're sort of stuck out
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 here all by ourselves," Hale says.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 her 6-2 son play against O'Neal, says that could change. "Over
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the summer, people will drive to Brackettville who wouldn't have."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 And if they don't? "When you see Bracketville on the TV, it fills

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signed David Duval, the third-ranked player in the World Golf Rankings, to a comprehensive endorsement contract, reported Golf World Business, citing several industry sources it didn't identify.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval will wear a hat, glove, clothes, and shoes bearing the company's familiar swoosh logo, and use a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball as part of the agreement, the newsletter said. His golf bag will bear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  logo and he's expected to help in the design and testing of irons for the world's largest maker of athletic shoes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Terms of the contract weren't disclosed by Golf World Business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 29-year-old Duval joins Tiger Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer, as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  endorser. Woods signed a five-year extension with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be worth $100 million in September.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval exercised an option to break his contract with Fortune Brands' Acushnet golf brands, including Titleist clubs, balls, shoes and glove, Golf World said. He's also escaping a new agreement with clothing maker Ermenegildo Zegna.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charley Moore, Duval's agent with IMG, didn't return a call seeking comment. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf spokesman Mike Kelly and Acushnet spokesman Joe Gomes had no comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We do not comment on and rumored contracts with players past, present or future," Kelly said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval was seventh on the PGA Tour's 2000 money list, with more than $2.46 million in winnings. He won the Buick Challenge in October for his first tour victory since the 1999 BellSouth Classic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval was at the top of the world rankings before Woods, who won 11 times in a 20-month span to take over the lead. Duval recorded the third 59 in tour history during the final round of the Bob Hope Classic in 1999 to tie the record for lowest score in a single round.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duval played the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball in the alternate-shot format at the World Golf Championships World Cup in Argentina earlier this month when partnered with Woods on the U.S. team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PRESIDENTIAL campaign: A campaign is under way to make Lee Elder U.S. captain for the 2002 Presidents Cup in South Africa.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sharon Elder said she was sending a letter Tuesday to PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem outlining the reasons why her husband would be the appropriate choice to lead the American team at Fancourt Lakes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Elder, known best as the first black to play in the Masters in 1975, broke another barrier a few years before that when Gary Player invited him to play a golf tournament in South Africa at a time when blacks and whites were banned from playing in the same competition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Player is the likely choice to be the International team captain in 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Lee has been back to South Africa several times, he has a school named after him there and he's well-received," Mrs. Elder said from their home in south Florida. "Those are the reasons why we feel so strongly he would make a wonderful captain."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WEST COAST CHA-CHING: A new title sponsor isn't the only difference in next year's West Coast Swing bonus program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The player who accumulates the most points based on top-eight finishes in the first nine tournaments will earn a $500,000 bonus up from $200,000 last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Second place will get $300,000, and third place $200,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The St. Paul, a property liability insurer, is sponsoring the program, which also pumps $300,000 into each tournament purse except for the Match Play Championship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BUZZ OFF: One of the more innovative lines for 2001 should come in handy for the summer months a mosquito-proof shirt from Dockers Golf. The product was developed for French military troops in North Africa.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday unveiled its Swift Suit, a full-body uniform that the company hopes will be worn by a select group of athletes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The suit, which has a hood with mesh ear holes and stirrups, is made in five different fabrics. It is designed to focus on runners' muscle-temperature and aerodynamics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The seams are all in the back of the suit, the front zipper is hidden and the sleeves extend to cover part of the hands  all aimed at producing better results by reducing air-flow separation.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Advertising executives are the people Hollywood loves to hate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spate of recent movies and TV shows featuring stars such as
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Mel Gibson and Ben Affleck depict Hollywood's version of your
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 typical ad executive: selfish, smarmy and brash -- but glamorous
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 nonetheless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're still branded as snake-oil salesmen," says Marshall Karp,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ad agency creative director turned screenwriter who wrote the

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Jason Alexander. "There are very few movies that reflect what
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 actually goes on in an ad agency."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's doesn't stop Hollywood from trying. Advertising characters
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 are a staple of TV shows and movies ranging from \b0 \i \ul0 Bewitched\b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 thirtysomething \b0 \i0 \ul0 and \b0 \i \ul0 Melrose Place \b0 \i0 \ul0 to \b0 \i \ul0 Kramer vs.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ad agencies provide a glamorous world for filmmakers to show well-dressed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 people acting badly in fabulous-looking offices. "Ad people are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the more picturesque version of the salesmen from \b0 \i \ul0 Glengarry

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gears up to launch its largest-ever line of women's shoes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and apparel in 2001, the product placement was "a once-in-a-lifetime
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 opportunity to position our brand in a powerful way," says Pam
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 McConnell, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  director of entertainment marketing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meyers even cast three female executives from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- Jackie Thomas,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Rory Rubin and Nancy Monsarrat -- in a scene in which Gibson pitches
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  real-life ad agency, Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, made
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a mock TV commercial just for the film.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Says movie reporter Angela Dawson: "It goes back to Darrin Stephens
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and \b0 \i \ul0 Bewitched\b0 \i0 \ul0 : Advertising is one of those professions
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 that's easy to portray on screen."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ad executive" and "closer" at "L.A.'s hippest ad agency."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The plot describes the stereotypical movie ad guy: "Buddy makes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 things happen. Fearlessly confident and wildly charming, his clients
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 love him. Thanks to his killer good looks, so does every woman
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 he meets."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Affleck hung out at real-life Los Angeles agency TBWA/Chiat/Day
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to research his role. "Ben had a lot of ideas," recalls Clay
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Williams, now a commercial director for Crossroads Films. Consumer
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 trends analyst Tom Julian of Fallon Worldwide thinks "advertising
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 looks pretty stupid" in \b0 \i \ul0 Bounce\b0 \i0 \ul0 . But Williams thinks filmmakers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 simply use "hotshot ad executive" interchangeably with "investment
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 banker" to portray driven, Type A personalities on the silver
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 screen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's half truth, half fiction. But that's OK. People don't go
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to the movies to see a documentary about the ad business," Williams
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * \b0 \i \ul0 Cursed. \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0  \b0 \i0 \ul0 Steven Weber stars in the NBC
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 sitcom as a "cheerful ad executive whose fast-track life is suddenly
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 derailed by what he thinks may be a mysterious hex." Unctuous
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ad types provide a "shortcut" for audiences, says Ellis Verdi,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CEO of DeVito/Verdi. "You say 'ad executive' and certain pictures
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 come to mind. We're still the slick, say-whatever-you-want-to-hear

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MANCHESTER United last night confirmed their status as the biggest football club in the world with the announcement of a huge sponsorship deal with sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth an incredible GBP 302.9million over 13 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The "strategic alliance", which starts in August 2002, makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official sponsors and hands them worldwide rights to all United merchandise and global retail operations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal could be even more lucrative to United, who will get half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  net profits generated from the licensing and retail operations providing they stay in the top half of the Premiership and play in Europe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To put the deal into perspective, it works out at GBP 23.3million a year for United and the total is more than a quarter of the GBP 1.1billion Sky are paying all the Premiership clubs for live TV rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It dwarfs the GBP 30million four-year shirt sponsorship deal United announced with Vodafone - then a record - and the only comparable arrangement is the sponsorship deal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have with the Brazilian national side.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A statement from to the Stock Exchange read: "Manchester United plc has granted to athletic, footwear and apparel leader \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exclusive worldwide rights as, firstly, the official sponsor of Manchester United footwear, apparel and equipment, secondly, the official kit (uniform) supplier to Manchester United, thirdly, the manufacturer, marketer and seller of licensed apparel, footwear, equipment and other merchandise bearing the Manchester United trademarks including replica kit and, lastly, the operator of Manchester United's global retail operations."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will set up a subsidiary to control the global operation, each appointing half the directors. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will appoint the chairman, who will have the casting vote, and the sportswear giants will also have the option to terminate the deal after six years if they should wish.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 United's statement said the club intend to use the revenue for "general corporate purposes" - meaning some of the money will be available for buying players, though Sir Alex Ferguson is unlikely to benefit as his contract expires in the summer of 2002 and he has said he will move on.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and United will also launch grass-roots football programme aimed at young players, with the GBP 1million-a-year running costs funded by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, Mark Bosnich's fortunes have gone from bad to worse after finding out he needs a hernia operation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Manchester United goalkeeper could be sidelined for up to six weeks because of the surgery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This rounds off a miserable week for the Australian after he slipped to fourth in the pecking order at Old Trafford.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bosnich could not even make the squad for United's midweek Worthington Cup tie at Watford and rookie Paul Rachubka came on for Raimond van der Gouw when the Dutchman was sent off.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE multi-million-dollar question for Olympic-watchers tonight is whether Marion Jones will wear her Phantom suit for the 4x400m relay final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was delighted when Cathy Freeman powered to victory in the 400m final on Monday in her suit. Now the sponsor is hoping Jones will follow suit and give the company a huge global boost. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which has spent three years and millions of dollars developing the concept, launched the suit amid great publicity and hype in August, using its pin-up girl Jones, and US team-mates Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Of the three, only Jones has worn the suit during the Games, and that was in a heat. Industry watchers believe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is hugely disappointed that the suit has been shunned by the Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman's coach, Peter Fortune, said the decision to wear the suit had been hers, but there was no doubt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was extraordinarily happy that she did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, her influence does not extend too far outside Australia, and she is a virtual unknown in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sports marketing consultant Damien Stenmark said that "globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would be disappointed".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Is the women's 100m going to be a glamour event in the US? Yes it is," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fortune said Freeman would not decide if she would wear the suit again until later today. It all depends on how she feels.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "When she really feels positive about a race, she is more than likely to wear it," Fortune said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So while Freeman was confident about her prospects in the 400m and wore the suit, she was feeling tired before Thursday night's 200m final and decided against it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fortune said the main effect of the suit is psychological, and its effect on performance "miniscule".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Maybe one- or two-hundredths over 400m," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One competitor said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  athletes were usually well trained to obey their master's calling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They drill them on what to wear, and to do things like take their shoes off after a race (to attract more attention from television cameras)," the competitor said. "That kind of thing is always orchestrated at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can exert some pressure to conform to the corporate vision, at the end of the day the athletes retain the right to wear what feels most comfortable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has said this week that it has had no problem with the decision of Jones not to wear her suit when she won the 100m final last week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite this equanimity, the company has extensively used Jones wearing the suit in its Olympic advertising, obviously believing the sprinter would wear the suit during the Games.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  FROM what we know of Cathy, it seems safe to say money is way down on her list of priorities in terms of what winning that gold means to her. But try and hold back the tide of commercial opportunities now facing the nation's darling. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Yesterday, as Sydney woke to 220 brand new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  billboards of a bodysuited Freeman only hours after her win, one sports marketing expert put her potential contract earnings with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at $5 to $10 million a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sporting Frontiers managing director Michael Porra said: "She could be the first Olympian to become a truly global brand. With endorsements, merchandising and media deals she could be worth $5 to $10 million a year."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "My opinion is that after winning that gold medal under intense pressure her worth has increased 200 to 1000 per cent, not just in endorsements but in merchandising and media deals."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mark McCormack, owner and founder of the big gun in global sports management, International Management Group, was more circumspect, saying it was impossible to put a figure on what financial gains Freeman might reap as an Olympic gold medal winner, but that she should act quickly if she wanted international dividends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Freeman's business manager and accountant, Alistair Hamblin, yesterday gave no indication Team Freeman would be swoop quickly on commercial opportunities arising from her win.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Cathy is going to weigh up her options and decide where her career is going after the Games," he said.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is set to shell out 300 million pounds ($675 million Cdn) to have its swoosh logo appear on the jerseys of the world's most popular professional soccer club, Manchester United, according to a published report Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The massive 15-year deal is to take effect in 2002 when Man United's current contract with Umbro expires, the Sun newspaper reported. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At 20 million pounds ($45 million Cdn) a year, the reported deal would dwarf the seven million pounds ($16 million Cdn) a year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pays to provide Brazil's national team its distinctive bright yellow jerseys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It would also overshadow the $100- million US ($150 million Cdn), five- year contract extension recently signed between golf sensation Tiger Wood and the American athletic apparel company.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   It's 34 metres wide and 16 metres high, contains 20,000 LEDs, and took about four months from conception to completion. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After all the work that went into building it, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had better hope its giant, electronic mural in Toronto sells a whack of running shoes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The mural, which covers almost the entire side of a five-storey building near Skydome, is unusual even in the increasingly creative outdoor advertising industry. It features a huge painting of sprinter Bruny Surin and an electronic clock counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until the 100-metre event at the summer Olympics in Sydney.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr. Surin's name doesn't appear anywhere, which ties in with the countdown clock. "If you don't know his name now, in [whatever the clock happens to say at a given moment], you will," the text reads. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's clever and, by the looks of it, darn expensive. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials won't comment on the cost, but Olga Simonovic, production manager with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad agency, says: "It's the biggest project I've worked on." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One challenge was finding a manufacturer to produce a clock that large (the numbers are close to two metres high). The agency tapped a local company, Hamilton Digital Designs Ltd., which makes outdoor advertising displays and video scoreboards used at hockey rinks. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company, which was founded in Hamilton but has since moved to nearby Burlington, delivered the clock about 10 weeks after getting the order. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite its size, the clock uses surprisingly little electricity. Brian Nugent, Hamilton's sales manager, says it draws just 1,100 watts - equivalent to 11 100-watt lightbulbs. That's because LEDs are highly efficient; most of the energy they use is converted to light. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Another thing about the LED numbers: They won't need maintenance and will remain bright for many years - long after Mr. Surin hangs up his running shoes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So what will \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do with the numbers after the Olympics? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "My boyfriend wants them for the rec room, but I think they're a little too large," Ms. Simonovic says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Speaking of creative outdoor ads, sex toy merchant Lovecraft has relocated its store down the block in Toronto. To announce the move, it's running street-level ads that say: "We've gone down on Yorkville." In case you missed that ultra subtle sexual reference, the ads also exhort consumers to "Come visit our new location."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Investors aren't the only ones tiring of the dot-com craze. Hoping to exploit the public's sense of dot-com overload, advertisers are rolling out campaigns that mock society's obsession with the Internet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Nestl\'e9 Canada, for instance, is running outdoor ads for its Kit Kat chocolate bar that read, "Give.com us.com a.com break.com." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fashion firm Kenneth Cole distributed newspaper inserts asking, "Dear Internet Addicts, what is the world .com-ing to?" and referring to a fictitious Web site, how-to-destroy-your-social-life.com. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Its own Web address, \b \i0 \ul0 kennethcole.com\b0 \i0 \ul0 , was displayed prominently, of course.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    An Internet site where ad types trashed each other's work disappeared yesterday after a story about it appeared in The Globe and Mail. A note left on the site Wednesday said it would be moving to an undisclosed location because a reporter had been nosing around. Anybody got the new address?

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cisco Systems Inc. said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose and revenue climbed 53 percent. It also set a 2-for-1 stock split. Net income rose to $825 million, or 23 cents a share, from $282 million, or 8 cents, a year ago. Profit excluding acquisition expenses was $906 million, or 25 cents vs. $609 million, or 17 cents.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A former vice president and senior financial consultant for Merrill Lynch in Boston pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges for bilking clients of nearly $6.3 million. Prosecutors said Donald J. Martineau, 56, of Tewksbury, Mass., convinced clients to invest funds, diverted the money, then lost nearly all the money through risky trading of stocks and options.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 LAST February, the sneaker giant got kicked, sacked and dunked when it announced earnings would fall short of Wall Street's expectations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stock of the Beaverton, Ore. -based company plummeted almost 50 percent and hit a 52-week low of $26.56 -- seeing billions in capitalization disappear in its biggest drop in more than a decade
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then image issues piled on: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fielded a $10 million suit filed by a Manhattan doctor, another suit filed by guitarist Bo Diddley and heaps of criticism concerning allegations of Indonesian sweat shops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But CEO Phil Knight seems to have coached his company back from the brink. Its market cap is up to $11.55 billion; shares are trading at TK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  branched out. It announced the formation of a new high-tech electronics division, responsible for portable audioplayers, heart-rate monitors and two-way radios. It launched a line of futuristic watches and other accessories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports earnings tomorrow -- in a conference call and simultaneous Webcast -- analysts are expecting to see 44 cents of profit per share. They're pegging next year's profit at $2.35.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is moving from Just Do It to If the Shoe Fits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The athletic company will turn traditional shoe sizing on its
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 head this spring with a unisex running shoe that comes in 13 colors
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 but just six sizes: XXS, XS, S, M, L and XL. For a male, for example,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a medium fits traditional sizes 9-11.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The "Air Presto " shoe hits stores June 1 with a suggested retail
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 price of $ 85. The lightweight slip-on, in development for four
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 years, uses "stretch mesh" to create what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  says is a "sock-like,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ultracomfortable fit for a variety of foot shapes and sizes."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has even coined a catchy slogan: "T-shirts for your feet."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a first for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . You see it with socks and slippers,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 but nobody's ever done this with an athletic shoe before," notes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tobie Hatfield, senior advanced engineer at Beaverton, Ore.-based
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Can \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actually wean consumers from numbered sizes? The answer
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is open to debate, experts say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is breaking every paradigm we're used to," says marketing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 consultant Ken Harris of Evanston, Ill.-based Cannondale Associates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "This will either be a big hit or a huge failure."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hatfield says Air Prestos fit better than "overbuilt" shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "This is a new paradigm. We're trying to let your foot be in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 control of the footwear rather than the footwear being in control
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of your foot."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is positioning it as "irresistible summertime comfort for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 runners." But runners are a notoriously finicky and brand-loyal
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Real runners tend to be very loyal to a particular shoe. If
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 they like it, they buy it over and over," notes John Horan, editor
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of newsletter \b0 \i \ul0 Sporting Goods Intelligence\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tested Air Prestos with more than 30 athletes, including
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 masters triathlete Don Ardell, who wore them to victory in two
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 international competitions. Ardell has requested several pairs
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for the upcoming world championships in Perth, Australia, says
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 spokesman Dave Mingey.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will provide retailers with point-of-sale charts and other
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 materials to help customers pick sizes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What about a consumer on the cusp between sizes? "It comes down
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to personal preference," says Hatfield. "Do you like your footwear
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 tighter or a little bit looser?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Experts say \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sizing scheme has big potential benefits for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the company and retailers. By making the shoes unisex, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wipes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 out "half its inventory" and halves its production costs, notes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Harris. Retailers, meanwhile, "have less sizes to inventory,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 which is an obvious benefit for them," says Hatfield.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Air Presto rollout will be backed with a multimillion-dollar
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 advertising and promotional campaign by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad agency Wieden
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 & Kennedy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the ads successfully sell the message that Air Prestos "conform
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to your foot and become your shoe," the line will be a hit, predicts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Harris, himself a runner currently training for the Boston Marathon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 But if consumers' takeaway is that they should try Air Prestos
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 because they're easier for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , "they will never get on people's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 feet."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The branded sneaker market needs a hit. It is coming off several

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tiger Woods will be crowned the undisputed king of celebrity endorsements in a few days when he signs a $100 million contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it was reported yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 24-year-old golf superstar will pocket the payout over five years, a source close to negotiations told The Associated Press. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The package would dwarf the contract for $80 million over seven years that Detroit Pistons star Grant Hill has with Fila Sportswear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Retired Michael Jordan, whose endorsement deals raised the bar in sports, also had a $20 million-a-year agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' agent Mark Steinberg declined to talk specifics of the package, but called it an "outstanding contract." He added, "We are within days of a signature."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The eye-popping offer caps a record-breaking summer on the links for Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With three tournaments still to play, his nine victories this year are the most in one PGA Tour season since 1950, and he is on pace to shatter the all-time season-scoring average set by Byron Nelson in 1945. In just four years, he has won all four major championships - the youngest player to do so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has represented \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since turning professional in 1996. His previous contract with the sportswear company was said to be worth about $8 million annually.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earlier this year, Woods signed a five-year, $3 million endorsement deal with Buick. In all, Woods has endorsement contracts with 11 companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract might be worth more than its face value, a source told The AP, because "there are so many different revenue streams. It's impossible to calculate what the end result will be."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf President Bob Wood described the contract as "pretty creative."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wood also declined to discuss contract details but did say the amount would be partly tied to sales.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -sponsored athletes including the Australian Olympic team should reconsider their relationship with the sportswear giant in light of claims of labour abuses, a human rights group said yesterday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Launching its anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  campaign to run during the Olympic Games, Community Aid Abroad-Oxfam's NikeWatch group released a damning report into the company's remaining factories in Indonesia, with claims of $2-a-day wages, long hours and anti-union policies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a high-profile campaign and consumer boycotts in the 1990s, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pulled out of the Indonesian factories targeted, signed covenants against child labour with US President Bill Clinton and implemented an independent monitoring scheme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, according to NikeWatch and its report, Like Cutting Bamboo, the problems with labour standards persist in the remaining Indonesian shoe, garment and sporting goods factories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wages are so substandard at all three factories surveyed that even a childless worker has to put in 60 or 70 hours a week, plus overtime, to to earn enough to feed, clothe and house themselves and save a small amount.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report also documented shouts of abuse at slow workers by supervisors who called them "monkey", "pig" or "dog". It said pro-union workers had been subjected to discrimination and access to union officials had been curtailed. "At the very least, we would like [sponsored athletes] to raise the issue with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said the co-ordinator of NikeWatch, Mr Tim Connor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Even better would be if they would come and see the situation for themselves and meet with the workers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The findings in NikeWatch's report were based on visits by activists, declarations by Indonesian unionists and research by a former professional United States soccer player, Mr Jim Keady, who spent time as a worker on local wages in an Indonesia factory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NikeWatch also called on the company to sign the Australian Homeworkers code of conduct, which rejects the use of poorly paid pieceworkers operating out of home, and to introduce more stringent monitoring.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labour practices are audited by accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers and by non-government organisations. The company forbids children under 16 working in its factories and the use of outworkers, but Mr Connor said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  monitoring was inadequate, infrequent and easily circumvented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  didn't allow monitoring by groups it "doesn't control" and the monitoring often failed to interview production line workers.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said its labour practices were more closely scrutinised than virtually any company's on the planet.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE International Football Federation (FIFA) is set to block recent "serious interference" by two Brazilian parliamentary commissions into the country's football federation, FIFA secretary general Michel Zen-Ruffinen said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "According to the information we have, we don't believe there is a real need to interfere, but we hope to obtain more information from the CBF," Zen-Ruffinen said in Guatemala. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A parliamentary inquiry was launched to investigate the mammoth contract, worth a reported $230m, signed between the CBF and American sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The inquiry is trying to determine if Brazil's 10-year contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might harm the Brazilian game's interests and give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  too much say in where they play and when.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Quite naturally, we are following developments because, apparently, there is significant political intereference," said Zen-Ruffinen, adding that FIFA regulations formally ban all political or judiciary interference in affiliated federations.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The neck-to-ankle fashion has switched from the swimming pool to the athletics track with this radical "Swift Suit", to be available to the Australian Olympic track and field team. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -designed suit is the most spectacular piece in an otherwise conservative collection of sporting apparel for the 650-strong Australian team, unveiled yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australia's 400m world champion Cathy Freeman, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -sponsored athlete and the wife of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executive, has been experimenting with the suit, but has yet to wear it in a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement she said: "You feel like you are slicing through the air."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some athletes find the suit awkward because they feel like they are wearing nothing, or find the material around their knees uncomfortable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit is made of five types of fabric with varying textures to maximise aerodynamics, muscle temperature and the effect of the wind. For instance the hands are covered with a low-friction fabric, some of the back section is mesh to keep the large back muscles cool, and most seams are at the back to reduce drag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No-one is saying how many athletes will wear the suit at the Games, with most expected to adopt the traditional one- or two-piece outfits, which were also unveiled yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As for the casual wear, and softball, table tennis and soccer outfits, think school sports uniform circa 1977.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the sports where looks really count synchronised swimming and gymnastics the uniforms will be appropriately flash.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So, why are consumers willing to fork out so much to sport \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trademark swoosh on their feet? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology and Trade and Industry Lim Swee Say posed this question to some 150 Public Service Commission scholars at a seminar yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This was the first of many homespun analogies and anecdotes he used when he spent more than an hour giving scholars an insight into what makes the new knowledge-based economy tick.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Businesses like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  owe their success to value creators -people behind the scenes who come up with convincing marketing strategies, up-to-date design and cutting-edge technology.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These highly-skilled knowledge workers, who are responsible for creating a product's value, will be key to making Singapore a successful knowledge-based economy in the 21st century, said Mr Lim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is driven by strong advertising and marketing. People see Tiger Woods wearing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cap and think if they wear the cap, they can play like him ... So people buy it," said the avid golfer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an economy driven by globalisation and technology, advertising and the ability to innovate quickly can be more important than the product itself, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To prepare workers here for this trend, there must be a strong focus on education and training, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, as Singapore advances towards the new economy, there are several stumbling blocks, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Structural unemployment, the widening wage gap, the digital divide and an ageing population -all these, if left unchecked, could become obstacles to Singapore's success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The solution is to develop and nurture value creators. But first, mindsets must change, he explained.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Many times when we don't know the right answer, we keep quiet. But if we think we have the correct answer, we raise our hands to score points."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This attitude has to go, he said. In the new economy, decisions will be made based on imperfect knowledge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Most of the time, you will have to rely on only 50 to 70 per cent of knowledge. You won't know exactly how to do things, but you must still try."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Workers should not try to second-guess their bosses and only present what they think their bosses want, but must be active value creators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the widening wage gap may pose a problem in future, he said he does not foresee the introduction of a minimum-wage law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For 35 years, we've done well without such a law. The best way is to pay workers according to productivity."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He suggested, instead, a minimum-skills level to help workers stay employable.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  DAVID Beckham has infuriated his pounds 1 million-a-year boot sponsors Adidas by wearing their arch rival's trainers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And, even worse, photographs of him in the trendy blue \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes, were published worldwide. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Manchester United ace put his foot in it while kicking a toy football about in California with baby son Brooklyn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For he is currently starring in a major TV commercial campaign for Adidas in the run-up to the Euro 2000 soccer championship this summer. The German sportswear giant refused to comment yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But an insider said: "They are livid that Beckham was playing football in a public place wearing a pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sports shoes. He is paid around pounds 1 million a year to wear Adidas Predator football boots on the pitch. And it is part of his contract not to wear sportswear of any of their major competitors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There will be some stern words with Beckham's people to stop this happening again."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said last night: "We are delighted that David Beckham chooses to wear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products in his own time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The trainers David was pictured wearing are a pounds 35 pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air Sock Mock soccer sandals."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And determined to put Adidas booses' noses out of joint, he added: "If David wants to wear a pair of our Total 90 football boots at Euro 2000 we will gladly supply him with a pair."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One-year-old Brooklyn was also wearing a pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes during the holiday in America. But he doesn't have a contract with the sports firm - yet!

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has hit a sour note with guitar legend Bo Diddley, 71, who is suing the clothing and athletic shoe company because, he says, last year it marketed nearly 28,000 T-shirts with his name, face and the slogan, ''You Don't Know Diddley.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a suit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, Diddley (real name Ellas McDaniel) says he did have an agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but that was in 1989 and it was only set to last two years. The company allegedly contacted Diddley's managers last year about manufacturing more of the shirts, but the two sides did not come to terms. The musician claims the company ignored letters to cease and desist selling the shirts, and a rep for Diddley's management told The New York Times, ''This is a clear case of a big bully picking on the little guy.'' No comment from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cathy Freeman is expected to pocket more than $400,000 in special oneoff payments from her sponsors as well as boost her earning power up to tenfold following Monday night's gold medal win. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oneoff success payments are a standard feature in sponsorship contracts between companies and sporting stars of Freeman's calibre.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it is just a drop in the ocean compared with the millions of dollars she is expected to earn as her profile soars.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman's sponsors \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Qantas and Optus were reluctant to discuss the finer points of their arrangements with the runner yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nor would they speculate on looming price increases as Freeman's contracts come up for review, with industry expectations that Freeman's earning power will catapult from $1million a year to 10 times that over the next three years.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was capitalising on Freeman's success just hours after her win by placing new billboards around the Sydney CBD featuring Freeman in her "swift" body suit and another one saying "Official supplier of joy to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company also aired a new commercial based around images from Freeman's photo album which catalogued the star's life from her childhood days to athletic career. The ad aired in the first ad break after Freeman's win.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a longterm relationship with Cathy and we definitely see that continuing," said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Ms Megan Ryan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We can't discuss the specifics of our athletes' contracts, but it is often the case that special incentives are offered when you break a world record or win a grand final."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman's contracts with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Qantas are due to expire in December while her deal with Optus will be reviewed next month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Optus's marketing director, Mr Stephen Cameron, said yesterday he would be "naive" not to expect Freeman's sponsorship fee to increase following the Sydney Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was some talk that she might retire at the end of the year, that means we would have to consider our strategy if she was no longer competing," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman's future "marketability" looks assured after her gold medal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to court documents filed in July by Freeman's former managers Mr Nick Bideau and Mr Peter Jess, Freeman earned $3.41million in the three years before the Sydney Games. The court case has been held over until after the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some sports marketing executives were reported yesterday as claiming that Freeman was not as marketable as swimmer Ian Thorpe because she lacked Thorpe's confidence in the public eye and eloquence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But others said yesterday that her uniqueness and her naturalness were far worthier qualities to a sponsor.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  FOR the first time in 98 tournaments around the world, Tiger Woods yesterday played golf with a "swoosh" instead of a Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the latest and loudest shot fired in the golf ball wars, Woods experimented with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball in the first round of the Deutsche Bank Open in Hamburg, leaving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hopeful it could use his massive appeal to grab a greater market share.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake," said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Whether either happens remains to be seen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After a two-under 70 that left him three strokes behind first round leader Miguel Jiminez, Woods said he had been experimenting with a version of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball in the past few months at his home course outside Orlando, Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I wanted a test round on the tour," Woods said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my ball."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods has a five-year deal with Titleist that pays him $3.52m a year to use its clubs and balls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said he has an escape clause that would allow him to terminate the deal on short notice. "It's in my contract that I can try any ball," Woods said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For Woods to change could be just what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs to move into the highly competitive -- and highly profitable -- golf ball industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * AMERICAN John Cook shot a four-under 66 to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Colonial tournament in Fort Worth, Texas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Spurred on by an eagle two on the par-four sixth hole, Cook equalled his lowest score of the year to gain a one-shot edge over eight players including 1987 Colonial champion Keith Clearwater along with Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson -- the two losers in last week's play-off at the Nelson Classic.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Archrivals \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Adidas teamed up yesterday to sue Wal-Mart, charging the discount department store is selling counterfeit T-shirts and other items bearing their company logos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wal-Mart "has engaged, and is continuing to engage, in the knowing and intentional use of counterfeits," claims the suit filed in Manhattan federal court. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sports equipment companies charge the store also peddles trademark rip-offs at their Sam's Club subsidiary's outlets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit doesn't seek a specific figure in damages, but demands $1 million for each "type" of counterfeit item sold.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Adidas also want the court to force Wal-Mart to destroy any counterfeit products or advertisements it still has.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's the same old story with this company," said Steven Gursky, who filed the suit against Wal-Mart and has taken them to court over similar complaints brought by Tommy Hilfiger, Polo and Nautica.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's staggering that a company like Wal-Mart would do this and advertise this [counterfeit] stuff to bring in customers to sell all the other junk they have in their stores," Gursky said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's horrendous, and it's worse than the street counterfeiters," fumed the lawyer. "When you walk into Wal-Mart, you don't even stop to think about the possibility of getting ripped off, because they're the great American brand. What they're doing is making absolutely no effort to avoid infringing other people's rights," he said. "Then they walk into court and say aeyour honor, we are bad boys ... we are changing our policy.'"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wal-Mart officials denied the charges and said they follow rigid inspection procedures to root out any counterfeits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have no reason to believe that the merchandise we have sold is not 100 percent authentic," said spokesman Les Copeland. "If we're not sure about the origin of merchandise, then we just don't buy it."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not my idea of a good corporate citizen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This week the massive sportswear company was forced to admit it has breached Australian workplace laws and it handed over $15,000 to the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union in an out-of-court settlement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ouch! That must have hurt -- about as much as being flogged with a warm lettuce leaf. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I can just imagine \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executives dismissing that sum as being roughly equivalent to a round of drinks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has no factory in Australia. It does, however, have an untold number of Australians sewing an untold number of garments for it -- products such as AFL and rugby league merchandise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hires all its Australian production out to contractors, who are then free to sub-contract in an employment system which makes the monitoring of working conditions extremely difficult.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  How can we be sure that some poor migrants haven't turned their homes into sweatshops for paltry pay?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As the law stands, all companies which farm work out to contractors are required to register with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and to provide the AIRC with lists of contractors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  says the fact that it failed to comply with these requirements was a mere "administrative oversight".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Company spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the case the textiles union brought against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was "never about outworkers". She said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has contractual obligations with all its manufacturers that it will "comply with our no-homeworker obligation".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sure, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes its contractors sign such an agreement, but what are they worth?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The textiles union says it has evidence that outworkers have been employed here to produce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products and was ready to produce it if the court case had gone ahead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The union is not against outworking as such, but is concerned with ensuring such workers are not exploited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Community Aid Abroad has been monitoring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for years and lists its concerns about the company on its Internet site, www.caa.org.au/campaigns/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 /.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There you can read claims by US human rights and labor groups that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has contracts with about 50 factories in China and that workers at its Sewon factory are paid about US 26 cents an hour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is not difficult to work out why 40 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes are made in China.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One group visited the Sewon factory in July last year and reported that although the temperature was over 35 deg., the factory had no airconditioning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For its part, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  insists it has the highest of ethical standards on work practices and that it has moved to abolish the exploitation of child labor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  You wonder, though, what constitutes exploitation of adults by China's standards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In December 1996 a joint employer-union organisation called the Homeworkers' Code of Practice committee was formed to monitor outworking in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas and Reebok have signed an agreement to abide by the code the committee drew up. But even after this week's admission that it has broken Australia's employment laws, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won't sign up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It has, however, finally provided the AIRC with a list of its contractors. It shows \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pays a host of small companies to arrange to make garments for sporting teams such as Melbourne Storm, the Brisbane Broncos, Canberra Raiders, Carlton and Port Adelaide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Come December, you'll be able to determine which companies have signed up by looking for a "No Sweat" label on their clothing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It would make good PR sense for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to just do it, sign the code and join the "No Sweat" campaign.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Vince Carter's problems with Puma appear to be over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Toronto Raptors superstar has signed a six-year endorsement contract worth $30 million US ( $44.5 million Cdn) with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to a report on HoopsTV.com.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The king of shoe marketing, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sales have slumped in recent years and its stock prices have fallen about 29 per cent over the past 12 months. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Signing Carter would be a major coup for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , giving the shoe giant perhaps the NBA's most popular and dominant player to market its products since Michael Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quoting anonymous sources, the report said between $18 to $20 million of the $30 million will go to Puma to free Carter from his previous shoe contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But lawyer Norman Oberstein, from the firm Oberstein, Kibre and Horowitz that represents Puma, said there isn't any agreement yet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talks are progressing "satisfactorily," Oberstein told the Canadian Press news service from Los Angeles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There isn't anything pending. We're just trying to work things out and hopefully we will."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The relationship between Carter and Puma soured last season, when the player complained about the footwear the company provided him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This summer, an arbitrator ruled that Carter owes Puma $13.5 million for breaching his endorsement contract by publicly denouncing Puma's shoes and negotiating with other companies while under contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ruling also said Carter was responsible for Puma's legal fees (about $1 million) and prohibited him from signing an endorsement deal with another company for three years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oberstein said Carter would need permission from Puma to negotiate with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When asked if Puma had granted him that permission, he refused to comment, saying only that any agreement would be announced promptly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said the three sides were ironing out the final details of the deal, with Puma demanding a cut of royalties generated by Carter's future with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Eric Oberman refused to say whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been negotiating with Carter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't comment on rumours or speculation and we have absolutely nothing to announce at this point," Oberman said in a telephone interview from Portland, Ore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter's agent, IMG's Mark Steinberg, was travelling and unavailable for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter is currently in Hawaii training with the U.S. Olympic team.

A lower appeals court ruled in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  favor March 20, saying the company's defense of its Asian wages and benefits was speech on a public policy issue and was protected by the First Amendment.

Instead, it is talking to companies ranging from Internet service providers to banks and online retailers who would then resell or give away the Dot.Station.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AS THE Olympics opens with one of the biggest advertising blitzes in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  history, the athletics shoemaker reported first-quarter profits of $378.7 million, beating Wall Street expectations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The earnings of $1.40 per share compare with $360.7 million, or $1.27 per share, in the year-ago quarter. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Analysts surveyed had pegged earnings at $1.35 per share.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sales for the quarter rose 5 per cent to $4.69 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're off to a good start for the fiscal year," said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman Phil Knight, who just returned from Australia in preparation for the annual shareholders meeting on Monday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Asia and South America showed the biggest growth while European sales remained strong, but shoe sales fell again in the US, falling 1 per cent to $1.69 trillion. US clothing sales also were off 2 per cent to $587.92 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The earnings report was issued with some of the top names in sports -- including sprinter Cathy Freeman -- flashing the "swoosh" logo worldwide in television commercials preceding the opening of the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist with a German institute for consumer health. The chemical is used to reduce the smell of sweat.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If your shirt smells after a good run, be thankful. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. shirts in Europe are being recalled after a television program claimed they contain a chemical that's supposed to keep shirts from smelling like sweat, but can also lead to infertility.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shirts in Canada do not contain the same chemical, a spokeswoman for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Canada Ltd. said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "None of these jerseys are sold in Canada," Michelle McSorley said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, she said, preliminary testing by the company yesterday showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not deliberately add the chemical in Europe, either, and that only a small batch of clothes from factories in Italy and Britain had the chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Complete test results should be available today, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shirts in question are replica soccer team shirts sold through two German clothing store chains. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made the shirts and sewed on logos provided by the soccer teams whose uniforms were being replicated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McSorley said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is investigating the possibility that the chemical got on to the shirts by way of the logos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We certainly would not have added it," she said, adding that concentrations of the chemical are very low.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This isn't a life-or-death situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chemical, tributyrin, is a fungicide that removes the smell created by the bacteria in sweat. It is often used in the shipping industry to control mould and mildew, said Thomas Kullick, an environmental spokesman for a European textile association. The heavy metal compound has also been used in anti-barnacle paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 German retailer KarstadtQuelle AG has pulled all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer shirts from its shelves, while Metro AG's Kaufhof Warenhaus AG department-store unit stopped selling the soccer shirts and may pull the rest. A spokesman said Karstadt has sold more than 10,000 of the shirts, which retail for about $110 apiece and are replicas of the Borussia Dortmund soccer team's yellow-and-black kit. Karstadt will refund or exchange shirts it has sold but has not reached an agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on who will pay for that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The risks and benefits of tributyrin have been debated for years. A study of 140 snail species has shown that a high concentration of the chemical caused infertility, which is why the World Wildlife Fund has called for a ban, the German daily Die Welt reported.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  From Richard Lewis athletics correspondent FOUR years ago, when the colour of his shoes was gold, Michael Johnson secured the real thing by winning two Olympic titles. This time, nothing will be artificial. Sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has produced a pair of 24-carat-gold-coated spikes for Johnson, who plans to bid farewell to the Olympics with another world record. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Johnson asked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to make him a lighter pair of running shoes to help him soar around Stadium Australia in the 400m. When its designer delivered the prototype, he could not believe it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "People think it is all about image," said Johnson. "The shoes in 1996 made such an impact, because of the way I ran and the way they looked, and we were under pressure to better them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told me they were going to make them of gold, I said, 'Boy, get on with it'. But I won't be throwing them into the crowd afterwards because they are a little more expensive."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The new spikes also consist of aerodynamic lace and aluminium, they weigh 116grams and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  designer Kevin Hoffer and developer Tobie Hatfield ensured the plate was made to accommodate Johnson's upright style.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A smile was not far away from the face of the man who lit up Atlanta with his performances, which included a 19.32secs world-record 200m run, described as the greatest moment in Olympic history. And when the 400m begins here on Friday morning, he is ready to secure another momentous achievement, cracking the 43-second barrier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Johnson smashed the world record for the distance with 43.19 at last year's World Championships in Seville to complete his clean sweep at 200m and 400m. "I don't need to achieve anything more," he said ominously. "I'd like my 400m record to equal my 200m record. I want it to be so far out there that it is hard for people to understand, and I am capable of doing it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It is my ambition to break 43 seconds and I'm running out of time. I'm proud of my 400m record but I know I can do better."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The 33-year-old American made history in Atlanta by becoming the first man to win the 400m and 200m at the same Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Johnson, who plans to retire next year, possibly after the Goodwill Games in Brisbane, has cited Britain's Jamie Baulch as one of the key men to how his final Olympic 400m race could be run. Baulch has electrifying speed during the opening stages and Johnson said: "If Jamie gets in the final, it will make it a faster race."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is unlikely to change the outcome, though, even if Johnson does not agree. "It is not a case that everyone else is simply going for silver or bronze," he added. "Every time I run I know that if I show any vulnerability, then the others will take advantage. I have to earn my success. "I always perform best at the big championships and all my records have come at them. But there is less pressure on me now because I am running in the 400m and the relay only." Two golds, then? One for each shoe.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In the meeting with the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), we have

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    The country's aerial defense system is showing vulnerability as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules missiles, the ROK Air Force's only long-range weapons against air attacks, have become almost unusable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Air Force said it has failed to find the cause of a mid-air explosion of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules missile that occurred off the west coast city of Taechon last October.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since the accident, the Air Force has sent inquiries to the U.S. Guided Missile Command three times to discover what caused the explosion. But the U.S. command only replied that it can't give accurate answers because its relevant department was disbanded and manufacturers ceased production. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Air Force says it won't be able to conduct routine drills of the U.S-made missile for fear of recurrence of similar accidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Currently, South Korea has 190 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules missiles but it is questionable whether they could be fired in the event of an emergency. The missiles, first developed by the United States in 1953, were transferred to the ROK Air Force by the U.S. Forces Korea in 1965.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 South Korea is the only country in the world that still deploys the almost depleted missile. The U.S. allegedly disbanded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules military units in 1985 and Taiwan also retired its stock in 1991.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Air Force officials complain that the 4.5-ton missile should have been replaced long ago. It can be also used as a ground-to-ground missile.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Defense Ministry is now pressing ahead with a major procurement project, code-named SAM-X, to replace the outdated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules. But military experts say the project may be postponed due to recent domestic political developments on the Korean peninsula.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ministry asked the Ministry of Planning and Budget to allocate funds for the launch of SAM-X in its 2001 budget bill. But it remains to be seen whether funds for the project will be granted because SAM-X is given lower priority, compared to the Air Force's next-generation FX fighter program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 U.S. Patriot, France's SAMP-T and Russia's S-300 are competing to win the 2 trillion won project.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Apart from last year's mid-air explosion, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hercules exploded in mid-flight three seconds after it was accidentally fired from an air defense unit near a beach in Inchon in December 1998. The explosion caused numerous fragments from the projectile to rain down on a residential area, injuring a dozen civilians and shattering hundreds of windows in houses and apartments.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT'S a far cry from the days of baggy shorts and singlet. Welcome to the Swift Suit - the kit that's being touted as a winner for any serious athlete. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The futuristic suit offers no glimpse of well-toned flesh, but covers the head and body with the aim of aerodynamically assisting athletes to run faster than ever.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even the old Lycra kit can be thrown into the dustbin, according to makers \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The sportswear giant has spent two years designing the suit to reduce the effects of altitude, wind speed, temperature and track surface during a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gina Dewitt, US 800-metres runner, unveiled the suit at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Oregon. And American sprint superstar Marion Jones, the fastest woman in the world, will also be publicising the kit that is set to take this year's Olympic Games in Sydney by storm. "It does make me feel I will cut through the air," said Jones. "The suit has been made to help me run faster. That is what I think about when I am wearing it and the reason why I like it so much."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Swift Suit follows on the heels of state-of-the-art bodysuits by adidas and Speedo for swimmers. These have helped break world records in the pool, while causing fierce controversy.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  designer Eddie Harber said the latest innovation was made from a mix of fabrics including nylon, polyester and mesh. "Our idea was to take track and field where no one has gone before," said Harber.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Sprinters like to be hot and we spent a great deal of time concentrating on how we could create a suit which could maintain warm muscles for an athlete."Our answer was to use darker colours on certain parts of the suit to absorb radiant heat from the sun."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE replica football shirts withdrawn from sale in Germany following allegations they were poisoned are made in Britain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, pledged a quick probe to determine whether any of its products - including Glasgow Rangers shirts - are laced with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the public," spokesman Vada Manager said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said it appears the shirts were made in Britain. Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers are among the teams that wear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  German department stores have already pulled Borussia Dortmund shirts off their shelves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The action followed a German television report that the replica shirts contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat. But British and Dutch tests have shown it to cause mutations in marine snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist with a German health institute.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The former coach of Brazil's national soccer team denied accusations that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  forced Ronaldo to play against medical advice in the 1998 World Cup final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I am no puppet," said Mario Zagallo, who testified yesterday before a Senate commission investigating Ronaldo's health problems before the game, which Brazil lost 3-0 to France. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zagallo, who now coaches Rio de Janeiro's Flamengo, told the commission he was prepared to play Edmundo in Ronaldo's place. But, he added, Ronaldo showed up 45 minutes before the game and begged to play, assuring the coach he had been cleared by doctors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He told me he was in perfect physical condition," Zagallo said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ronaldo, one of soccer's biggest stars, played despite mysterious convulsions shortly before the game.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the team sponsor, has steadfastly denied that it forced Ronaldo to play in the sport's showcase game.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The commission is expected to call Ronaldo, team doctor Lidio Toledo, Brazilian Soccer Confederation president Ricardo Teixeira and Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo's roommate who first reported the seizures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The commission is also examining if the federation's sponsorship deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gives the sportswear manufacturer the right to decide who plays on the Brazil's national team.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 make-overs, nothing has had a bigger image change than the tracksuit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , what on Earth were you thinking? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is astonishing, given the myriad approvals an ad must receive before it sees the light of day, how often firms screw up. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sometimes, the goof can be forgiven. The makers of Dimetapp cold medicine, for instance, recently pulled a funny TV ad that depicted thieves crashing a truck through a store window and taking off with merchandise. The reason: The Retail Council of Canada complained that it trivialized theft. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest fumble belongs in a class all its own.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In its zeal to sell more overpriced shoes, the footwear giant has stepped - or, more accurately, stomped - on disabled people. The ad in question is so utterly insensitive, the thinking so profoundly flawed, that those responsible should be thrown off the nearest bridge with their Air Jordans tied together. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The magazine ad for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ACG Air Dri-Goat trail running shoes claimed the product would help the jogger depicted in the ad avoid hitting a tree, an accident that could render him a "a drooling, misshapen, non-extreme-trail-running husk of my former self, forced to roam the Earth in a motorized wheelchair with my name embossed on one of those cute little licence plates you get at carnivals or state fairs, fastened to the back." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Geez. You forgot the part about not being able to bathe and feed yourself. And never skating with your kids. And let's not forget all those stairs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ad drew swift complaints from disabled advocates, who called it "outrageous" and "denigrating." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did the right thing by pulling the ad from future publications and issuing a formal apology on its Web site. It said it meant to show that using the right shoes can prevent serious injuries. Good idea. Terrible execution. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dan Wieden, chief executive officer of long-time \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agency Wieden & Kennedy, also admitted in a statement that "we have stepped over the line with this advertisement and there is no excuse for it." The copy, he said, mysteriously "got through our approval process." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a habit of putting its sneakers in its mouth. During the Sydney Olympics, it pulled an ad that showed U.S. runner Suzy Favor Hamilton wearing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sports bra while fleeing from a chainsaw-wielding attacker. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  People didn't find that funny, either.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't the only advertiser to miscalculate the public's response to an ad. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Fox TV network is removing billboards for its new TV show, \b0 \i \ul0 The Street\b0 \i0 \ul0 , after people complained about its portrayal of women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The billboards depict a woman wearing men's briefs and an unbuttoned dress shirt. The copy reads: "They say Wall Street is a man's world. They're only half right." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A Fox spokeswoman said the ad provoked complaints "from a few pockets" around the United States. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We want to be provocative. We want people to tune in. But we don't want to anger people," the spokeswoman told Associated Press.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Quiz: It's British, it's on television and it stars a plump woman who scampers up a hill, peels off every last stitch of clothing and shouts, "I'm normal." What is it? 
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monty Python's Flying Circus? Benny Hill?\b0 \i0 \ul0  Nope. It's the newest ad for Marks & Spencer. You know, those lame stores nobody shopped at in Canada so they closed. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As profit tumbles at home, Marks & Sparks is trying to burnish its staid image. But why show a size-14 woman in the buff on a hilltop? Research indicated female forms are getting larger, and the chain wanted to highlight clothes for plus-size customers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  British newspapers were not impressed. One reviewer called the strategy "dubious." Desperate might be another word. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Maybe if the naked woman was running from a maniac with a chainsaw . . . never mind.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Sugar-coated cereals and candies don't just rot your teeth, kids. Now, they help you learn to count, too. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This insidious trend started in 1994 with the \b0 \i \ul0 M&M's Brand Counting Book\b0 \i0 \ul0 , which teaches toddlers to go one, two, three using pieces of the branded candy. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The book was a hit. Then along came books using Froot Loops, Hershey's chocolates, Oreo cookies and Reese's Pieces. Some of the more advanced branded books offer lessons in multiplication, division and fractions. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Now, I've got nothing against learning your kids how to do math. But should we really be trusting this vital job to M&M's and Oreos? Fact is, nobody lives on candies and cereal alone. A kid's gotta have French fries, too. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Which is why McDonald's should step up with a Supersize Fries and Drink Counting Book. You know, eat a French fry, take a drink - that's one - eat a French fry, take a drink - that's two. Maybe little Johnny could count how many bites it takes to devour a Taco Bell Chalupa. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Let's act before it's too late, people. As Whitney Houston said, I believe that children are our future.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BEAVERTON, Ore. Tiger Woods signed a five-year extension to use \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc.'s golf balls, clothes and shoes, the company said, as he nears the end of his current five-year, $40 million agreement with the world's largest athletic shoemaker.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Financial terms weren't disclosed. The Associated Press reported that the agreement is worth $100 million, citing a source close to the negotiations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bob Wood, president of the company's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf division, said Woods signed the extension on Thursday, a deal that runs for five years starting in September 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You don't often get a chance to work with the best in the world," Wood said from his office in Beaverton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods, 24, signed his first contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shortly after turning professional in August 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The extension would place Woods on a level with the one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has with retired basketball superstar Michael Jordan, who has his own clothing line with the company. Former boxer George Foreman and partners sold his name to Salton Inc., which makes the George Foreman line of grills, for $137.5 million in cash and stock earlier this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At least one analyst said he isn't sure \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can make money on Woods' new contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I think it's hard for it to be profitable unless golf continues to grow at unprecedented levels," said Bob Williams of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, which matches athletes with endorsers. "The good news is that they've got the next marketing Jordan; the bad news is that he's in a niche sport."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wood said the company might look at going into the golf-club business, a move that Williams said might be the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They've got to get Tiger interested in designing his own clubs," Williams said from his office in Chicago. "They have a chance to make a lot of cash then."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many prominent players have had their own club-making companies, including Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has won the past three major championships the U.S. and British Opens and U.S. PGA Championship and is the first player to win nine U.S. PGA Tour events in a year since Sam Snead won 11 in 1950.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He's the youngest player to win all four majors in his career and has set records for single-season and career money won on the U.S. tour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' decision to switch to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball in June ended a marketing conflict between Woods' two top golf sponsors \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Acushnet Co.'s Titleist that started last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the golf ball market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist had threatened \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a lawsuit after Woods appeared in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial in which the golfer bounced a ball off his wedge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead, Titleist reworked Woods' agreement so that he was paid only when he used its equipment in tournaments.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE Premier League has come under fire for booting the Mitre match ball into touch and replacing it with space age technology from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The American company paid pounds 9m for a three-year deal to replace Mitre as the offical Premiership matchball supplier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A former NASA worker helped develop the "Geo Merlin" which is supposed to fly faster and truer than any other football.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mitre wrote to all Premiership clubs asking them to endorse their ball, which has been used for the last eight years, but failed to stop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  winning the deal which is worth millions of pounds in brand awareness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gordon Strachan, manager of Coventry who tested the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball, wrote to the Premier League about the Merlin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I understand NASA helped develop this ball and that is where it belongs - in space. It is a very poor ball indeed. I only knew recently that our academy had tested it but having used the ball in the past three weeks, I hate it. It's far too quick and unpredictable and I would have stuck with the original Mitre ball."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld also slammed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball. He said: "It moves around all over the place and it is very slippery. I hate it and I know the other keepers will as well."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who say the ball has been endorsed throughout Europe, said: "We are not surprised that the introduction of such a technological innovation has led to some debate. We are confident that when inflated to the correct pressure the Geo Merline flies truer and straighter than any other ball."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 More than 100 striking actors and their supporters protested outside midtown Manhattan's Niketown yesterday, blasting the athletic apparel giant because it has continued to shoot commercials featuring athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The footwear corporation was targeted because this week it announced that Olympic sprinters Michael Johnson and Marion Jones had crossed picket lines to shoot \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  insistence on being (arrogant) and being proud of it is what aggravates people," Screen Actors Guild spokesman Paul Reggio said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "An Olympic runner has one shot in four years to be in the public eye," Reggio said. "They're putting the athletes in the middle."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Michael Johnson, Shame on You, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Scab," said one protester's sign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The strike has created factions in the sports world: The NFL, NBA and major league baseball players' unions support the actors, and Tiger Woods recently refused to shoot an ad during the strike. The Broncos' Terrell Davis, the Titans' Eddie George, the Bucs' Keyshawn Johnson and the Rams' Kurt Warner have crossed picket lines. Athletes who appear in commercials are required to join SAG and could face discipline by the union.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shaquille O'Neal also angered union members when he said, "I'm going to Disneyland," for a commercial moments after the Lakers won the NBA title Monday night. However, O'Neal, who planned to donate the money he will be paid for the ad to charity, supports the strike, his agent said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This was a one-time result of a championship won by the Lakers," Leonard Armato said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Bob Mitchell said the company can't interrupt its commercial-production schedule, which is based on sporting events such as the NBA playoffs, the Olympics and the World Series.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have been on strike since May 1. Actors are paid each time a commercial is shown on network TV but paid a flat fee when the ad is run on cable. The unions want to be paid each time an ad runs, but ad agencies want to pay them a flat fee for all network and cable ads.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Who's afraid of the big, bad \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike?\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Apparently Brazil, which is in the throes of a congressional inquiry into the contract between the American sportswear giant and the country's national team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Brazilians say the deal gives \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to much control over the national team, including the right to specify how many international exhibition games the Brazilians play each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agreed to cut the number of friendly games the team plays under terms of its 10-year, $240- million (Canadian) rights contract, the country's government wants more changes to the agreement, a congressional deputy said. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Brazilian Soccer Federation agreed to reduce the number of exhibition games Brazil plays to two from five a year under terms of the contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The president of the government's lower-house inquiry into the deal said he'd ask public prosecutors to take legal action against the Brazilian federation if more changes weren't made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The contract breaks a law that sporting organizations shouldn't cede their autonomy to a foreign company," congressional deputy Aldo Rebelo told Bloomberg News. "It would be easier if the CBF and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  change the contract. If not, we'll request legal proceedings be opened."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspicion is the Brazilians want more money, especially in view of the massive deal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signed with England's Manchester United, worth more than $670 million over 13 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The inquiry has been a bit of a joke. Former national-team coach Mario Zagallo, questioned over the use of Ronaldo in the 1998 World Cup final despite a mysterious seizure suffered by the striker hours before the game, shouted at deputies and said little.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm not dishonest, my life is clean," Zagallo screamed at deputies whom he said were questioning his honesty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bad-boy striker Edmundo, who looked like he'd had a tough night on the town and about an hour of sleep, caused a near-riot when he appeared, with deputies clamouring to have their pictures taken with the striker and congress practically shutting down. Edmundo, displaced by Ronaldo when it was decided he could start the final, merely said Ronaldo was cleared by doctors to play and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had nothing to do with the decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joao Havelange, the wily former boss of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, showed his ability to dodge and parry. Asked what he thought of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pact, Havelange said he hadn't read it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, FIFA continues to raise the alarm about "Significant political interference" into Brazilian soccer. But it has stopped short of reiterating the threat first made by president Sepp (Blowhard) Blatter to suspend the country from international play.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suspend Brazil from the World Cup? Yeah, right.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -   OH, HOW THE MONEY ROLLS OUT - Despite possible changes that would outlaw transfer fees, teams continue to pay huge amounts for players.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest extravagance came from England's Leeds United, which splashed out an estimated $38 million for West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ferdinand said the price tag didn't concern him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm here to play football and raise my game," said the 22-year-old, who joined West Ham's youth program at age 7. "European football is what I need and what I want. Leeds can offer me that, so this is a big step forward for me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal for the centre-back eclipsed the previous world record for a defender, set by Manchester United when it paid PSV Eindhoven $\cf8 \highlight1\cb1  \cf \highlight0\cb0 23.3 million for Dutch international Jaap Stam in 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also represented the biggest transfer fee involving an English club, beating the $32.8 million paid by Newcastle United in 1996 and Chelsea in 2000 for Alan Shearer and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Friday, perennial Scottish champion Glasgow Rangers, struggling this season, paid a team-record $25.5 million for ex-Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo. The Norwegian international paid off quickly, scoring yesterday as Rangers defeated arch-rival Celtic 5-1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, another English team that's feeling the pain is once-mighty Tottenham Hotspur. Manager George Graham admits that England international defender Sol Campbell is almost sure to leave, but he can't trade him off.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campbell has made it clear he won't leave until his contract expires at the end of this season. That means he can leave as a free agent and Spurs will get nothing. The likely beneficiary: Manchester United.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's time people realized you can't sell a player without that player's permission," Graham said. "Sol's stand is that he is not going anywhere until he sees his contract out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can understand that, but what I can't understand is why he is not sitting down and listening to our offer - even if he turns it down."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -    ITALIAN SCANDAL - Prosecutors in Italy have suggested that seven players accused of fixing a game this season be suspended for three years,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The players on Atalanta of Serie A and Serie B's Pistoiese were accused of fixing an Italian Cup game that ended 1-1. The investigation was launched after unusually heavy wagering on the game was noticed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -   SHORT PASSES - Don't talk to me about mild-mannered Swedes. Angry fans of AIK Stockholm wrecked a bar owned by former AIK star Anders Limpar after the midfielder, winding down his overseas career, signed to play with AIK rivals Djurgarden. Fans spat in Limpar's face, called him a traitor, broke windows in the bar and ripped down decorations. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Corinthians, the Brazilian team that was a surprise winner of FIFA's inaugural World Club Championship in January, has been having a tough time this season. The team now is looking for its fourth coach in 10 months after finishing 24th of 25 teams in the Copa Joao Havelange. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Speaking of mixing politics and sport: Spain is attempting to block a move by Gibraltar to join UEFA, the European soccer governing body. The British colony "is not an independent country," said a Spanish soccer spokesman. Do you think the protest has anything to do with Spain's longstanding contention that Gibraltar belongs to Spain? Why, that would be political. Must be some other reason. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Diego Maradona won't be allowed into Japan to watch his beloved Boca Juniors take on Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup tomorrow. His conviction for cocaine use means he is not permitted entry to Japan. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The three nominees for world player of the year, a FIFA-sponsored award, are Brazilian Rivaldo, Zinedine Zidane of France and Luis Figo of Portugal. The winner will be announced Dec. 11. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The record for most goals in a World Cup qualifier now is held by Iran, which swamped the American protectorate of Guam 19-0 in the first round of Asian qualifying Friday. Karim Bagheri, a midfielder with England's Charlton Athletic, had six goals. The Guamese (Guamers? Guamites?) haven't improved. Guam lost 19-0 to China in January at an Asian Cup qualifying tournament. ...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer admitted last week that he is the father of a son born to a Munich secretary. Beckenbauer, who is married and chairman of Bayern Munich, met the woman at the club's Christmas party, according to the mass-circulation newspaper Bild. The woman gave birth to a boy in August. Beckenbauer, 55, said he and his wife had "talked things over, and it wasn't easy, especially for her." Gee, no kidding?

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THIS could be the new-look Cathy Freeman at the Olympic Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman has tested the "Swift Suit" and is tipped to race in it this month. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The hi-tech skintight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit, complete with hood and mesh earholes, improves a sprinter's aerodynamics.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman secretly tested the suit in Melbourne late last year, and more recently in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's good," she said. 'You feel like you are slicing through the air."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been pressing Freeman to race in the suit since it was launched last month but she wanted further tests.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She is now tipped to wear the outfit in a race in Norway towards the end of the month.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 New York --- Tennis star Venus Williams, who won Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and two Olympic gold medals this year, signed what is believed to be the richest endorsement deal for any female athlete Thursday with Reebok International.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Terms were not announced, but the deal was reported to be worth $ 40 million over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We made a decision there is no better athlete to represent our brand,'' said Angel Martinez, Reebok's chief marketing officer. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Bober, who represents soccer star Mia Hamm, was impressed with Williams' contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''That's a pretty significant contract for a female athlete,'' he said. ''It can only help shorten the gap between male and female athletes on endorsements. It's another signal that we are moving toward parity, a clear message that women's sports are here to stay.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 20-year-old Williams recognized the significance of the contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''I have to be the best in everything I do,'' she said. ''We've come a long way with the WNBA and the soccer players. I'm doing what I can. Maybe that's the most important part."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Huge endorsement deals have been rare in women's sports. Monica Seles signed a five-year, $ 25 million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after returning to the women's tennis tour in 1996. Martina Hingis has a six-year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract that pays close to $ 30 million.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also has endorsement agreements with Mia Hamm, Lindsay Davenport, Lisa Leslie and Marion Jones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anna Kournikova may have the richest deal of all, a six-year contract with Adidas worth $ 50 million. But that agreement includes many incentives, including Grand Slam victories and high rankings for a player who has yet to win her first tournament. Its guarantee is about $ 3 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By contrast, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a reported $ 100 million deal with Tiger Woods, and Michael Jordan generates $ 40 million a year in endorsement income two years after his retirement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alex Rodriguez, who last week signed a 10-year, $ 252 million contract with baseball's Texas Rangers, figures to join the top echelon of athlete endorsers soon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'd like to clone myself about 80 times," said Reed Bergman of Impact Sports Marketing in Atlanta, who oversees Rodriguez's endorsements, corporate partnerships and community work. "Madison Avenue is really starting to see who this guy is and what he can be."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rodriguez already has numerous endorsements, but analysts say his record- breaking playing contract puts his commercial opportunities in a new light.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The price just went up," said Bob Williams of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago firm that matches athletes with endorsers. "When you're making as much money as he is, you can afford to do a small number of very lucrative, multiyear deals."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Apart from the usual health warnings about not going too hard too early, you might want to upgrade your footwear.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The cheapest price for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air Sanctum cross trainer was $135 at Foot Locker. Myer was a shade under $140 but Coles Myer shareholders would receive a 10 per cent discount.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jetpack 2 also ranged from $99 to $119.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said yesterday it was investigating charges that its jerseys for a popular German soccer club are laced with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But German department stores were not waiting; they have already pulled the shirts off their shelves. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The action followed a German television report that the jerseys contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an ideal additive for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the substance causes mutations in marine snails.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, pledged a quick probe to determine whether any of its products contained the substance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the public," spokesman Vada Manager said. The check will cover products sold in Germany and throughout the world.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  done it again. The shoemaker and sports colossus managed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to offend a number of viewers with a "cutting edge" TV ad during
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the Olympics on Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was so "cutting edge" in fact that on Monday morning NBC
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 cut it from its roster of spots approved for Olympic exposure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the style of teen terror movies, the spot has a masked psychopathic
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 killer sporting a chain saw terrorize an attractive woman in her
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 bathroom. The woman, Suzy Favor Hamilton of the U.S. Olympic track
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 team, flees her house with the killer in pursuit. Her speed and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 athleticism leaves the out-of-shape, would-be chain-saw killer
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 gasping for breath in her wake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The message appears, "Why sport? You'll live longer." The commercial
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 then closes with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh symbol and the familiar tagline,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Just Do It."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad provoked enough negative response for NBC to yank it from
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the rotation, spokeswoman Maria Battaglia says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The peacock network originally accepted the ad "subject to audience
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 complaint," Battaglia says. "Adverse audience reaction," meaning
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 more than 2,000 phone calls, caused NBC to pull the plug.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Scott Reames acknowledged that response has been
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "robust," though not entirely negative. "That's the risk we
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 take in trying to push borders," he says. "We think people who
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 understand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and who we are will get these ads."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reames noted that airing the spot during the Games, when families
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 could see it together, exposed it to a wider audience than its
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 intended core. Young people weaned on such fare as \b0 \i \ul0 Friday the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 13th \b0 \i0 \ul0 horror films and \b0 \i \ul0 I Know What You Did Last Summer \b0 \i0 \ul0 likely
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 found it funny.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the spot, from agency Wieden & Kennedy, did raise alarms
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with some who have praised past \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have loved almost everything \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has done in the past 15
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 years," says David Lubars, president of ad agency Fallon McElligott.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "But this spot I did not like at all, because of the violence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 against women. I am not a creative prude in any way, but that's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 not funny to joke about. It had me squirming. It's something you
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 can't kid about."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is no stranger to controversy. The marketer has cultivated
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a "bad boy" image, positioning itself as a rebel against the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 status quo. Its first ad starring Tiger Woods took on a golf establishment
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 that seemed to be slower than other sports to integrate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you don't have a lot of reaction on both sides, you've missed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the mark," says \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reames.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pitfalls of the celebrity endorsement were thrown into sharp relief this week with the news that two of its brightest (and most expensive) stars do not use the products they advertise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the United States, a lawsuit filed by a consumer group forced sports giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to admit Tiger Woods does not use the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls he is paid $1.5 million a year to endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In his recent run of victories, he has used a modified ball, created specially for him. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lawsuit, brought by a non-profit organization called Public Remedies Inc., claims \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was misleading golfers into thinking they were playing with the same ball as Woods, and demands the company returns its "ill-gotten gains" to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Britain, Jamie Oliver, the omnipresent Naked Chef who broke a BBC precedent to front a $2.25 million advertising campaign for supermarket chain Sainsbury, has admitted he uses independent suppliers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I do not buy from Sainsbury's for my restaurant," the chef whose programs air on PBS, said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For any chef, supermarkets are like a factory. I buy from specialist growers, organic suppliers and farmers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Woods and Oliver are not the first celebrities hoist by their own endorsements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Actress Helena Bonham Carter was signed as the face of Yardley cosmetics, then admitted she didn't wear makeup.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian cricketer Shane Warne was caught smoking, after pharmaceutical giant Upjohn and Pharmacia, makers of Nicorette gum, had sponsored him for $200,000 to quit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, said David Benady, deputy editor of Britain's Marketing Week magazine, sponsors should not be surprised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you've got a top footballer or pop star they're not always the most dependable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Things can go wrong, and often do."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He cited Pepsi's use of singer Michael Jackson until damaging claims about his sex life came to light.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With Jamie Oliver and Tiger Woods, (the revelations) might not necessarily be bad for business, but it just looks silly. You would expect Jamie Oliver to go to Sainsbury's."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the world of celebrity endorsement, some associations look unlikely, such as Ivana Trump's endorsement of Kentucky Fried Chicken, or the advertising by British comedian Jim Davidson, who recently signed an $8 million two-year deal with the BBC, of a car finance company, under the slogan: "Need a car but can't get credit?" "With Jim Davidson, you are targeting a certain sector of the population," said Benady.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It won't matter if they aren't going to use the product themselves, it matters that they identify with the brand."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Matthew Patten, chief executive of advertising giant M&C Saatchi Sponsorship, said:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you look at sport and entertainment, coverage used to be about the sport, or the entertainment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Now it's all about personalities, which makes endorsement all the more effective."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Savvy marketing men are ensuring their "celebrity" is never likely to misbehave, by using techno-personalities, such as Lara Croft in Lucozade ads.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A firm of jewellers which sold cut-price silver rings embossed with the trade marks of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Reebok has appealed to a judge to overturn a GBP 4,000 fine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The firm, Bountygold Ltd, was prosecuted by Gloucestershire Trading Standards, the shoppers' watchdog, after officers visited its shop Silver Mine in Cheltenham's Beechwood Shopping Centre in January last year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Gloucester Appeal Court heard the officers seized the rings claiming they breached the Trade Descriptions Act as customers would believe they were manufactured by the two international sports firms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Christine Ray, who protects the famous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "swoosh" in the UK, said the trade mark was not initially registered to cover jewellery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spends millions of pounds throughout the world every year and we must protect our trade mark."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Nigel Cole, prosecuting, said: "The public might not know the details of a registered trade mark but in this case the public would most certainly recognise these registered trade marks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's plain that the public would accept the rings were made by these companies but they were imported from Thailand."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The hearing was adjourned until Thursday.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MICK McCarthy's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Cup hopes were left in tatters last night as he contemplated a trip to the United States without two of his most important and experienced players.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Roy Keane and Gary Kelly have been ruled out of the American trip in June, as well as the Steve Staunton/Tony Cascarino testimonial and the friendly clash with Scotland on May 30.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ireland were already without Staunton, Lee Carsley, David Connolly, Ian Harte and Alan Maybury for the games, but McCarthy had put a brave face on it - until he received news his skipper Keane, and Kelly had been withdrawn by their clubs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Kelly was withdrawn by Leeds United manager David O'Leary yesterday, even though O'Leary had said at the weekend he was happy to allow the full-back to go. Kelly follows his nephew Harte in having a hernia operation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Republic take on the Scotland at Lansdowne Road on May 30, before leaving for their three-match tour of America and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Cup games against Mexico in Chicago on June 4, USA in Boston on June 6 and South Africa in New Jersey on June 11.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Keane injured a hamstring in last month's 3-2 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford and missed the Reds' final three Premiership fixtures of the season against Watford, Spurs and Aston Villa.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McCarthy said: "I'm sorry to have lost Roy. He had said he would be travelling to America, but he has informed me the hamstring injury has not sufficiently healed to allow him to travel, much less to play in the testimonial or against Scotland," said McCarthy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Roy has told me he hasn't trained since getting the injury and he's not
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  fit. And the loss of Gary Kelly is a blow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Speculation has been rife for months that Keane would not be available at the end of another long, hard season, but he had informed McCarthy recently that he was eager to spearhead the trip.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And with doubts over Niall Quinn, Stephen McPhail and Kenny Cunningham, McCarthy expects more withdrawals - however as yet he has not turned to youth to fill out the squad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Surprisingly, McCarthy has selected Phil Babb and Paul Butler, while Richard Dunne, Matt Holland, Graham Kavanagh, Steve Finnan, Steve Carr and McPhail - the only uncapped player - are the novices included.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McPhail could yet be withdrawn due to a hamstring problem, while Curtis Fleming could yet be added to the squad to give some cover at full-back.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TIGER WOODS, the World No.1 golfer who is paid GBP 8million-a-year to endorse \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products, refused to film an advert for the company because it would have meant breaking an actors' strike.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The commercial, scheduled to be screened during next month's U.S.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Open, was being filmed at Woods' home course near Orlando. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But members of the Screen Actors Guild, of which Woods is a member, were striking in order to force cable television to pay the same repeat viewing fees as terrestrial stations and the golfer refused to cross the picket line.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods is currently renegotiating his contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which is expected to pay between GBP 50m and GBP 57m for the next five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His agent Mark Steinberg said: 'We have no plans to shoot again for several weeks. There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  PAUL HEAVEY is in the running for the head coaching jobs at Bracknell Bees and Manchester Storm after quitting the Cardiff Devils.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Scot Heavey, whose 10-year playing and coaching career in Cardiff included ice hockey's inaugural Superleague crown in 1997, said: 'I'll cherish my memories of Cardiff but now I need a new challenge.' Bracknell and Manchester are looking for new coaches after last month's respective departures of Dave Whistle and Kurt Kleinendorst.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CHRIS FINCH is to remain in charge of basketball's Sheffield Sharks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A change of ownership at the club, plus attempts from Wembley finalists Birmingham to recruit him, had cast doubt over his future. But American Finch, 30, has accepted a one-year contract extension from new owner Darren Brown.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Finch said: 'Now we need to make sure the Sharks stay at the top of the British game.'

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods is refusing to film a new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. commercial because members of the Screen Actors Guild are on strike, the guild said. Members of the actors guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represent a total of about 135,000 actors, are on strike over plans by advertisers to pay actors flat-rate fees, instead of paying based on the number of times a commercial is shown on television. The 24-year-old Woods is a member of the guild. He is No. 1 on the PGA Tour's career money list with $14.7 million and has won three of the eight tournaments he's played this year. ''We're delighted Tiger understands and supports the issues in contention in this contract, his expression of union solidarity is most welcome at this time,'' guild spokesman Chris Krizman said. Woods, who also has endorsement contracts with American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. unit Buick, is one of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  most high-profile pitchmen. Woods made $47 million in combined tournament earnings and off-course endorsement in 1999, according to Forbes magazine. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hasn't rescheduled the filming, a spokesman said. The new commercial was to have aired during next month's U.S. Open. Instead, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will use commercials that profile its apparel and equipment to fill the ad time.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MARKETING executives did not wait long to begin cashing in on Cathy Freeman's Olympic gold medal in the 400m on Monday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Within three hours of her win, 220 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  billboards around Sydney had been changed to reflect Freeman's gold medal performance. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Cathy Freeman, official sponsor of joy to the Sydney 2000 Olympics," the posters declared across a photo of a triumphant Freeman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  television advertisements went to air on Channel Seven yesterday, as the hype surrounding Freeman's win continued.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  national advertising manager Nick Lewis said he had received a call from billboard company Adshel 15 minutes after the 400m Olympic final informing him the Freeman posters had been changed over at sites closest to Olympic Park.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman, who is married to American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executive Sandy Boedecker, has featured prominently in train station and bus stop advertising in Australian capital cities since the Olympics began on September 15.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Change the world 400 metres at a time," the billboards say, beneath a shot of Freeman wearing the hooded bodysuit she wore during last night's race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adshel, the company behind the bus-stop and train station advertising campaign, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the first company to take up the offer of overnight billboards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adshel publicity manager Diana O'Riordan said the international sportswear company had pre-approved the artwork in the overnight Freeman billboard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The photograph on the posters was taken months ago in anticipation of Freeman winning. Ms O'Riordan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had not arranged a back-up billboard if the unthinkable had happened.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AN IMAGE of athlete Cathy Freeman 70m high will be placed on the side of a Sydney skyscraper as part of the world's biggest billboard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cathy's image along with similar-sized pictures of tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and basketballer Lauren Jackson will be on separate faces of a commercial office building in Kent St.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The billboard should be ready within two weeks. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sports manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with the blessing of the Olympic Co-ordination Authority and building co-owners Waterways Authority and BT Funds Management, is believed to have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to display the sign during
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  During the Atlanta Games, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was renowned for its "ambush" advertising such as giving Just Do It signs to spectators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For the Sydney Games \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an official sponsor and therefore has been given a smooth ride to erect what will undoubtedly be the most dominant advertising feature in the city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An application is also before Sydney City Council for the three images, which are made out of "one-way vision" vinyl film, to be shown outside the Olympics from November 1 to December 20.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The image of Freeman is the size of a quarter-acre block -- 1082sq m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It shows her in the starting position with the words Just Do It and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh above her left shoulder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Motorists driving on the Bradfield Hwy, the main southern approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge will see this image.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The image on the western face, which will be seen by people on Sydney Harbour west of the Bridge, features South Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt having just slammed a forehand shot down the line.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While there are no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  slogans, his clothing carries the telltale logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The image of basketballer Lauren Jackson, which faces the east or city side, shows her about to make a shot and has the words Just Do It.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The image of Hewitt covers 621sq m, while the image of Jackson covers 870sq m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The application to the council claims the images are "more like public art than advertising".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The 26-storey building is about 200m from Darling Harbour -- a venue for several Olympic sports and community events.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Workers within the building will see through the sign to the outside, thanks to the film's "one-way vision" qualities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An advertising industry source said it was almost certain the three signs comprised the world's largest billboard.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * HAVE you noticed that the people insisting that globalisation is going to be good for the poor, as well as the rich and powerful, are the rich and powerful?-- Margaret Mack, Hendra.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 11
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * I'M working class and I would like more information on those "good, cheap shoes" that Michael Duffy (Perspectives, Sept 12) thinks \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is so kindly providing for me. As for the "greasy undercooked hamburgers in milk bars", I bet Duffy wouldn't mind a hamburger from my takeaway. It is non-greasy, well cooked and delicious, bursting with fresh vegetables that, at times, I wouldn't be bothered providing for myself. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We don't need McDonalds and real athletes don't need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .-- B. Pattison, Redcliffe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 12
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * WHEN Michael Duffy said "companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and McDonalds are giving workers the chance to dress and eat well" did he mean that if you work for them you can afford to buy a pair of shoes and some groceries? He can't possibly suggest paying $200 for a pair of trainers is "dressing well". As for Macs, has he ever heard the term "junk food"?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said most Australians were so unpatriotic that they'd prefer a delicious McOz burger to a germ-ridden, reheated pack of grease from a locally owned cafe. What a stupid generalisation. Did he ask them? The rationale he uses spoils the tone of his argument.-- D. Ripley, Marcus Beach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 12
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * IF anyone on the Australian Olympic swimming team deserves a gold medal, Daniel Kowalski does. I wish him all the luck in the world. Kieren Perkins may be a good swimmer but he is not God, as some would like to think.-- Susie Bauer, Ashmore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 12
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * THE thought of a catering company being willing to take legal action if someone is caught taking their own food into Stadium Australia reeks of greed. The proud cry "Let the Games begin" should be replaced by a more sensible cry: "Is the damn thing over yet?"-- Duke Shield, Tewantin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * THE most effective punishment for people caught deliberately lighting bushfires would be to make them return to the scene to face up to one of the worst consequences of their actions. They should be made to assist those people who give their time to collect and care for the burnt and suffering wildlife whose survival depends on the actions -- good or ill -- of the human species.-- Marie Tebby, Noosa Heads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 11
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * YOU report on the National Party's "bid to crush minor parties" (C-M, Sept 11). I can see the campaign coming unstuck on two fronts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  First, a lot of people vote for minor parties for no other reason than that they favour an underdog. The National Party's move could cause even more people to vote this way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Second, in some electorates, the Nationals are already a "minor party".-- Richard Carroll, Aspley.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Just what Vince Carter needs -- another advantage. Here's a guy who, during the Olympic Games, soared over the head of 7-2 centre Frederic Weis of France en route to a dunk. Legs spread in mid-air, Mr. Carter barely scraped the top of Mr. Weis's buzzcut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And now, the Toronto Raptors' star and defending slam-dunk champion will play with springs attached to his feet -- or at least the equivalent turned into a shoe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Carter wore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  new basketball shoes -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox that were 16 years in development -- at the Olympics last month and plans to keep wearing them all season.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Eric Oberman stops short of saying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox will allow Mr. Carter to jump even higher as he flies toward a hoop, but he said the shoe could help his performance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''If Vince Carter feels he can jump that much higher or dunk that much better, then that's just as good,'' he said. ''People are always talking about the mental and emotional aspects of the game.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Oberman said the shoes, which will be launched in stores across Canada and the United States on Nov. 15, act like miniature trampolines. Four small columns in the heel absorb the impact of the foot and then deflect the energy upwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''They shoot you back up,'' said Mr. Oberman, communications manager for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  basketball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''The technology is something that hasn't been seen before,'' he said. ''It's something that gives the athletes the feel of jumping higher and running faster and cross-training harder.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Carter was one of several NBA players to give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox a test run during the Olympic Games in Sydney. In the gold-medal game, Mr. Carter, Shareef Abdur- Rahim, Tim Hardaway and Antonio McDyess all wore golden versions of the shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Carter signed a $30-million, multi-year deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Sept. 17, although more than half of that money will be used to pay off the debt he accumulated when he walked away from a shoe deal with Puma.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concept behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox is actually 16 years old, meaning Mr. Carter was just seven years old when it was originally developed. The plan was to place little columns in the heel of the shoe that would act like springs on peoples' feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Oberman said designers, however, were unable to find the right product to make the springs and the shoe got put on the back burner through the 1990s when the company launched \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air and Air Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Designers came across a type of material about two years ago that would work -- a cushioning material used in Formula One race cars to absorb an impact and bounce back.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three versions of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox -- for basketball, running and cross-training -- were then developed and tested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Testers used the term ''boing'' to describe the feel of the new shoes, a term that will be picked up in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad campaigns before the launch of the shoes in Canada and the U.S. on Nov. 15 and in Europe and the Americas in February 2001.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox are already being marketed on the Internet in a series of short movies called ''movie trailers you can't see in movie theatres.'' Three of the films are shot in black and white, and feature Mr. Carter shooting hoops in an empty gymnasium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Oberman said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is uncertain at this point whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox will prove as popular as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air shoes of the 1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''I don't know if you can really compare them at this point, but obviously the prospects are high considering the research that has gone into them,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Carter and Mr. Abdur-Rahim will both be in Ottawa Thursday, to compete in the annual Naismith Cup game between the Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies at the Corel Centre at 8 p.m.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is how cool Jerome is: he doesn't use his last name. But while the twentysomething Korean-American model and sometimes actor may not yet have the name recognition of Liza, Madonna or Bono, his lean body and narrow handsome face is becoming widely known in Korea.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jerome jive-walks, runs and leaps in a string of recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ads in the pages of Korea's hottest magazines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spots are only the latest success in his modeling career which includes campaigns for Levi's and Omphalos. Though his small frame is a handicap on the runway circuit, his charisma has had him sauntering down the catwalks for Emporio Armani, Polo Jeans, Thursday Islanda and Renoma. He will also be seen at the upcoming Song Zio collection fashion show. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jerome never set out to become a beautiful person. "It all just kind of happened by chance," he said in an interview with The Korea Herald. He is referring to the summer before his sophomore year of high school, when he was spotted by a representative of Korea's Education Broadcasting Station (EBS) and was recruited to teach English on TV. The camera loved Jerome and he became a celebrity of sorts and discovered how much he enjoyed being a performer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like many models, Jerome harbors a wish to act.  He cites Michael Melton, one of his high school teachers as an inspirational figure who encouraged him to try his hand at acting. Jerome soon caught the acting bug and performed with the Far East Drama Team throughout high school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Upon graduating from the Seoul American High School on Yongsan's Military Base, Jerome set off for college, where he was enrolled at the University of Washington on a four-year full ROTC scholarship.  Upon returning to Korea to visit his parents for the summer holidays, Jerome was approached by Kim Yoon-sung, a music producer for IVY Music, to pursue a career in Korea's music industry. After months of practicing, Jerome was offered a chance to join the three-member dance group, ON/OFF.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ON/OFF turned out to be more off than on, and Jerome's foray into the music industry was short-lived. He has no regrets. He sees it as an opportunity for him to perform on stage and network with various people in the entertainment industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jerome's modeling debut came after he did a photo shoot for a friend who was a stylist for an SBS sports magazine. He was spotted by other casting agents and has since been modeling steadily.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently, he was approached to host the reality-based television series, "Happy Station" on Arirang TV. On the show, Jerome was given the task of making the dreams of foreign guests come true. "It was a great experience meeting different people and learning of their cultures, experiences in Korea and being able to give them a ray of sunshine in their lives, even it was only temporary," said Jerome of his stint as expat dream weaver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Currently, Jerome is pursuing a television career and serves as both host and reporter for "LOOK Inside," a newly launched entertainment program on cable channel 41 that features the fashion and style trends of celebrities. Jerome has also been cast in music videos for dance artists, Park Ji-yoon, SZ and balladeer Cho Kyu-man and appeared in television commercials for Dunkin' Donuts and an upcoming commercial for Cass Beer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Jerome has achieved success in his chosen career path, and when I think back to when I first met him, I am sure he has stayed true to his steadfast character," says Kim Yoon-Sung of IVYMusic. Jerome says being Korean-American has its advantages and disadvantages in the business. His goal is "to be a respected entertainer in not only his homeland but on an international level," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jerome hopes to break away from the typical Korean-American stereotypes on the screen and has focused his attention on studying Korean to achieve fluency in his ancestors' tongue. "I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had up until this point, I know that my business managers have been pivotal in spreading the word about me," said Jerome. "I believe that my love for my profession shows through the pictures and all of the projects that I'm involved in."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ANSETT has made big gains in the latest Olympic sponsorship survey at the expense of sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The official Olympic airline surged to fourth in the ranking of most recognised sponsors, five places ahead of arch-rival Qantas. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Sweeney Sports report to be released today shows that consumers have finally worked out that Qantas is not a Games sponsor after years of successful ambush marketing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Coca-Cola also made substantial gains in the survey, which placed Telstra as the most recognised Olympic sponsor ahead of AMP and McDonald's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which topped the Sweeney survey in January amid a blaze of publicity, plummeted to seventh despite the recent launch of its Australian team uniforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Sweeney survey of 1000 people also found that interest in attending the Games had risen 5 per cent over the past six months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Swimming was easily the most popular sport and almost 80 per cent ranked the Olympics as the world-leading sporting event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But 28 per cent believed it was overrated as an event.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A CORNISH research and development company has announced this week the successful completion of a deal with the world-famous sports clothing giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to supply hundreds of thousands of products to the Amercian corporate firm.  The deal, which will place Bodmin-based Micro Thermal Systems (MTS) on a global trading platform, will mean an order for nearly one million sports support items, which have been developed exclusively by the Cornish company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "When you realise that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  market share is worth GBP 46 billion, the potential for us is absolutely staggering," said MTS's managing director John McLeod. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has just launched a range of 44 sport support products, and it is amazing to be a part of that development," added Mr McLeod.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MTS was established in 1992 by John McLeod and Cornish dentist Nigel Middleton, after they noted the discomfort caused by clothing items which did not allow the body to breathe sufficiently while undertaking strenuous sporting activity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Following months of research and the securing of a worldwide patent for their new product, Stomatex, which has revolutionised the technologies in this area and won the pair countless trade awards and prestigious regonition from the Department of Trade and Industry, the British Museum and the Millennium Dome, this contract could be seen as the next logical step forward for the firm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Stomatex product has been tried and approved by world-famous UK boxer Lennox Lewis and British athletes who competed in the last winter Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The main element of the design, Neoprine, can be extensively used in the watersports, soft orthopeadics, sportswear, footwear, equestrian and thermal protective equipment sectors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The founding patent was secured in 1993 and additional patents were subsequently established in 19 of the world's major trading trading nations with three separate patents in the USA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MTS has won a number of awards with its revolutionary product, including the Design Council Award for design and technology in 1992, the DTI's Business Link Award for marketing in 1998, the Millennium Product Award from the DTI in the same year, and a permanent place as an exhibition at the British Science Museum's 'Bio-Mimetics' department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The next few months will be very, very exciting for this little Cornish company which sprang from the innovative ideas of a Cornish dentist," added Mr McLeod.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Prince George Plastics under-16 girls soccer team won a medal Sunday at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Provincial B Challenge Cup, it just wasn't the colour they had planned on taking home. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the bulk of the team won silver medals at the last two provincial tournaments, winning gold in front of the home-town crowd was the script they hoped to follow.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead, the local side needed a 1-1 tie against the winless Kelowna Heat in their final round-robin game to come away with the bronze medal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After two wins Friday to open the tournament, Dean Lebel's team was still talking gold, but a disastrous Saturday came back to haunt them. Prince George fell 1-0 to eventual gold medalist Nanaimo and then lost a heartbreaker 2-1 to Abbotsford, winners of the silver medal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Things just didn't go our way Saturday,'' said Lebel, whose club was also named the top team from the Interior in the six-team division. ``The girls worked as hard as they could but we were just a little unlucky Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``But I'm proud they came out (Sunday) and did what they had to do. It would have been easy for them to fold their tents, but they showed a lot of heart in winning the bronze.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prince George was unlucky not to beat Kelowna Sunday as striker Tannis McCubbin and midfielder Chaley Drazenovic peppered Heat goalkeeper Mallory Grant with numerous shots.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An early penalty kick from Lyndsay Lebel was the lone marker to beat Grant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``I don't know what it was but we just didn't totally click this weekend,'' said Drazenovic. ``We had high hopes because we've been playing together for a long time now, but sometimes things don't go your way, I guess.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Friday P.G. Plastics downed Penticton 2-0 and Richmond 3-1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 n The Prince George Lakeland Mills under-15s also earned a bronze medal and were named the division's Interior champions after they pounded the Kelowna Express 4-0 Sunday at Massey Place Stadium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After beating the Kootenay Selects 2-1 Friday Prince George lost back-to-back games to Powell River and the North Shore Vipers. The locals then drew 2-2 with Burnaby's Cliff Avenue United before downing Williams Lake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Powell River went on to win the gold medal and was the only team in the entire tournament to have a perfect 5-0 record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 n The Prince George Jewelers under-17s downed Williams Lake 2-0 Sunday to claim fourth place and the Interior title for the division.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prince George finished with a 2-1-2 record, losing only to the West Vancouver Devils, who went on to take the bronze medal. The locals also beat Nelson and tied Eagleridge and Gordon Head. Gordon Head, of Victoria, won the gold, while Eagleridge took the silver
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 n Prince George Proaction Photography under-12s lost 1-0 to the Kelowna Strikers in their final round-robin game Sunday and that left them out of the medals in fourth place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The locals finished with a 2-3 record with wins over ICSF Phantoms and the Vernon Selects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gordon Head won the gold, with Eagleridge taking the silver and Kelowna the bronze.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 JAKARTA, Indonesia
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MOST Indonesians have never heard of Tiger Woods or they might think it was unfair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  top salesman, so to speak, Woods earns $20 million a year for promoting the company's products simply by playing golf. The Indonesians who actually make those shoes and sports clothes earn an average of $786 a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An extreme example, perhaps, but that is what globalization is all about. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of many American companies that have taken advantage of the world's economic inequities to make a profit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Contrary to popular belief, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not manufacture its own products. It is a marketing and design firm that buys its goods from independent contractors in underdeveloped nations, where wages are low, and resells them in richer nations where people can afford to pay $100 for a pair of sneakers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You may be interested to know that those sneakers cost about $16.75 cents on the factory floor. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  breakdown is 65 percent for materials, 15 percent for labor, 15 percent factory overhead and 5 percent profit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Americans don't want to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nikes\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If they did, U.S. wage scales would make the cost and markups prohibitive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Worldwide, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has contracts with 700 factories that employ 550,000 workers in 50 countries. Indonesia, for example, has 11 footwear factories, 12 apparel factories and four equipment factories manufacturing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products that account for approximately $1 billion in exports a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These plants employ 110,000 Indonesians whose take-home pay averages $65 a month. This may not be much by our standards but is nearly double Indonesia's minimum wage of $34 a month and comes with other benefits that include overtime and holiday bonuses, social security, free health care, free schooling, free clothing, at least one free meal a day and sometimes free housing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a country where 36 million people are unemployed and 60 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, pegged at $1.50 a day, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  jobs are highly desired.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 85 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  workforce consists of women who labor for a few years in the factories, then go home to get married, further their educations or move on to better things. Few have any regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kusniah, 21, and Dunnarli, 22, both work at Astra Graphia Tbk., a factory that makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tennis shoes 25 miles outside Jakarta. Their only other alternative would have been wading in rice paddies to help their families eke out an existence in agriculture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kusniah has only a junior high school education, Dunnarli finished high school. Both met their husbands at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  plant in Balarajah, and both consider themselves lucky to be employed at a time when Indonesia is experiencing massive political and economic turmoil.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have good working conditions and they take care of our health," said Kusniah. "What more can you ask?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That said, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come under heavy criticism for running "sweatshops" in Southeast Asia. And company spokeswoman Tammy Rodriguez is the first to admit that public pressure forced the company to clean up its act.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has contracted for independent auditing of workplace standards. All production lines in Indonesia have stopped using solvent-based adhesives and substituted water-based adhesives that produce no noxious odors. All limit their workers to 20 hours of overtime a week. And any worker who does not have a high school education can get one gratis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The only sweatshops that exist in Indonesia today are those that make "unbranded" shoes, such as those sold in Target or WalMart. Many are joint ventures between Indonesians and Koreans or Taiwanese, and industry sources say conditions in those factories remain "terrible."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But don't blame Tiger Woods.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come under fire for using Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in a TV commercial featuring the word sorry 15 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman plays only a minor role in the ad but the timing of its release has angered Aboriginal activists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  National Sorry Day Committee chairwoman Audrey Kinnear claimed yesterday \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to exploit the Aboriginal reconciliation process. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She said the continuous use of the word sorry trivialised the issue of whether the Federal Government should apologise to the stolen generation of Aborigines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Why select a word that is current, politically and nationally ?," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using sorry in so many ways and so many times, they are actually trivialising what sorry stands for." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has used 20 mainly Olympic athletes who apologise to family, friends and workmates for an obsession with sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, say sorry in a lighthearted manner for being driven by success. Freeman does not actually say sorry in the ad but turns to the camera and says "Can we talk about this later?" before running off into the distance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympics spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the timing of the "No apologies" commercial was purely coincidental.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Ryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to show how athletes had to apologise to a lot of people they did not have time for during Olympic preparations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Whilst we understand that there is some sensitivity and contention around the sorry issue it was a more behind the scenes look at athletes who make no apologies for the fact they have to say sorry to a lot of people," she said. "Sorry is word used by people every day." But Ms Kinnear said Aborigines were offended that Freeman was being "used" to capitalise on the reconciliation debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I thought with all the publicity, nationally and internationally, they would have been a bit more sensitive about it," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not Cathy's fault but many Aboriginal people would be thinking that Cathy is guilty by association."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman's managers were unavailable for comment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC, the official American broadcaster of the Olympic Games, has pulled \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Horror advertisement off the air. The company's mistake? Emulating about 15,000 camp horror movies, ranging from the Halloween series to Scream, by showing a chainsaw-wielding murderer chasing a nubile blonde.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  version, the would-be chainsaw killer wheezes and gasps for breath after about 10 steps. But the blonde turns out to be an athlete, so fit that she easily outruns him. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  closing message is: ''Why Sport? You'll live longer.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Considering that the message is fundamentally upbeat, barring the commercial seems silly. Or does North American society only tolerate horror sequences when the girl doesn't get away?

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SIR ALEX Ferguson will walk out of Old Trafford and into an GBP 8million job if he accepts the offer to become a world ambassador for sports equipment giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sportsmail understands that the American company, synonymous with Tiger Woods, are ready to pay the Manchester United manager GBP 2m per annum over four years to roam the globe, promoting their name within football. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Earlier this week Ferguson, who stands down in two years' time, revealed: 'I've got a lot of offers and one is really staggering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'It would be a four-year contract for huge money and would involve a lot of travelling.' That job is almost certainly with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who intend being the leading brand name in soccer a position they are acquiring in golf thanks to Woods. Ferguson told the Shareholders United magazine: 'I don't think you want a manager to grow old in a job. In two years' time I'll have done 16 years, which is a long time. And there are the pressures. But I still feel young and fit and in two years I'll still feel young enough to take up other activities.'

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maybe now all guys will be able to jump.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is launching high-tech shoes called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox that literally
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 put springs on your feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Basketball shoes go on sale Nov. 15, runners and cross-trainers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in December. Suggested retail: $ 150.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox feature spring-like columns in the heels made from resilient
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 foam similar to that used in Formula One race cars' nose pieces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The "springs" produce a "trampoline-style" effect, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company hopes the sneakers put bounce in the flat $ 7.6 billion
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 sneaker market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This industry needs a lightning rod right now," says Dave Larson,
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  director of brand initiatives. "Sales are flat, and retailers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 are looking for a kick-start. We're doing what we can to jazz
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 up the industry."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shoe's $ 150 tab puts it at the high end of the market, says
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 John Horan, publisher of \b0 \i \ul0 Sporting Goods Intelligence \b0 \i0 \ul0 newsletter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "The average consumer will say that's an awful lot of money for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a sneaker. But the 14-year-old sneaker connoisseurs will think
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 it's cool and new. And that's where this is aimed."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBA star Vince Carter, who signed a $ 30 million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in September, is the center of the $ 18 million ad campaign to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 introduce the shoe. Carter and four other Team USA players wore
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the shoes at the Olympic Games. Sprinters Marion Jones and Maurice
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Green also wore Shox during medal ceremonies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter is wearing the shoes in NBA preseason games and the Toronto
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Raptors star, along with some others, will wear them for the regular
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 season.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertising campaign is built around a single-word theme:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Boing." Print and outdoor ads starting Nov. 15 have the shoes,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the logo, the swoosh and just one word of copy: "Boing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why "Boing"? Because consumers used the word repeatedly during
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 testing, Larson says. "We figure one word sums it up."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some consumers during testing worried about getting debris stuck
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in the spring area, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  finally decided to keep it open for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the look.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter's first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  TV ads begin in January. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is negotiating
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to use images of Carter's in-your-face dunk over hapless 7-foot-2
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 French center Frederic Weis during the Olympics, Larson says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Picking the NBA's new slam-dunk champion is a smart move by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 marketing experts say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Vince is assuming the high-jumping throne from Michael Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 So positioning \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox as successor to Air Jordan is a neat
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 second-generation idea," says Jack Trout, president of Trout
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 & Partners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How much jumping benefit will the average consumer really get?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Larson says: "I say, imagine spring on your heels. They're not
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 catapults. You're not going to hit your head."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Will the NBA raise red flags over the shoes? Spokesman Mike Bass
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 says: "We think it's great \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come out with a new shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 We're looking to get more information on it."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three teams will carry the Nelson Youth Soccer flag at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Cup provincial tournaments in Chilliwack and Prince George.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The U15 and U17 boys as well as the U17 girls have qualified for the six-team provincial tournaments. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm very confident," said U17 boys coach Mike Sedlbauer, the defending provincial champs. "We have a very good mix with the potential to win it all again."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sedlbauer is hopeful the team can ride the back of provincial-team alternate goalkeeper Matt Bird. The Nelson keeper has spent most of the spring attending tryout camps for the U17 boys B.C. team
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With a couple of break in our favor, who knows," said Sedlbauer. "We, of course, have Matt (Bird) in the net. Plus we're very good in the midfield, led by Chris Thast and Dave Martin anchors our defence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The U17s open the tourney Friday morning against Prince George before pre-tourney favorite, Gordon Head of Victoria. Gordon Head last year won the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  A Cup title.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Saturday, Nelson meets Penticton and then Langley in the afternoon. The U17s conclude the tournament Sunday morning against Cliff Avenue United from Burnaby.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 U15 coach Deb Fuhr has a tough task ahead, molding a team that has yet to put it all together into a provincial champ in Chilliwack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The U15s, who defeated Cranbrook 2-0 in a best-of-three series to advance to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Cup, have displayed flashes of brilliance en route to the provincial berth. However, at a tourney in Kelowna last weekend the team struggled to a 2-1-1 mark.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The same holds true for Sabrina Sedlbauer and the U17 girls. Sedlbauer, off to Prince George, has seen her team hampered by injuries this season. Those setbacks led to a 1-2 record during the Kelowna Summer Soccer classic last weekend in the Okanagan City. N

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOME things are true even though Phil Knight, the chairman of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , believes them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight recently made news for withdrawing a contemplated $30 million gift to the University of Oregon after the university balked at joining a coalition -- the Fair Labor Association -- that was formed by human rights groups, colleges, the U.S. government and companies such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to alleviate global sweatshop conditions. Oregon opted to join an alternative group being pushed on college campuses, the Worker Rights Consortium, which also plans to combat sweatshops, but refuses to cooperate with any companies, such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The natural assumption is that Knight is wrong. The truth is, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a shameful past when it comes to tolerating sweatshops. But on the question of how best to remedy those conditions in the future -- which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has now agreed to do -- Knight is dead right and Oregon wrong: The best way to create global governance -- over issues from sweatshops to the environment -- when there is no global government is to build coalitions, in which enlightened companies, consumers and social activists work together to forge their own rules and enforcement mechanisms. That's what the FLA represents and it's what the WRC doesn't.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It comes down to this: Do you want a make a point or do you want to make a difference? The FLA was formed to make a difference. The WRC was formed to make a point.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FLA was forged four years ago, and it now includes the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the National Council of Churches, the International Labor Rights Fund, 135 universities and major apparel companies such as Liz Claiborne, Levi Strauss, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Reebok and Adidas. After long talks, this diverse group agreed on a nine-point code for any apparel factory anywhere in the world -- including rules against forced labor and child labor, as well as freedom of association, minimum wages, maximum working hours, lighting, bathrooms and safety. They also agreed on a system of independent monitoring, surprise inspections and follow-ups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Companies whose factories comply will be able to sew an "FLA" label into their clothing, and the 135 universities have agreed that their logos will go only on FLA-made products.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WRC, by contrast, is backed by protectionist U.S. unions, such as Unite, that don't want any system that would give a stamp of approval to any production outside the United States. That's one reason the WRC won't work with companies. But that means the WRC has no way of consistently monitoring factories or following up remedies, and it is only focused on clothing sold on college campuses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you want to improve people's lives in the absence of a global government, you need to align the economic interests of the better global companies with the social interests of the least advantaged people," said Sam Brown, the 1960s anti-war activist, former U.S. ambassador and now director of the FLA. "We need to make these companies our allies, not our opponents. We won't change the world overnight. But it is foolish to dismiss the FLA because it does not go far enough or fast enough. The issue is how to get from here to there, and the FLA has a real strategy for harnessing U.S. consumer power to change the lives and working conditions of real people."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some of Australia's leading athletes have defended the repeated use of the word "sorry" in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisement, as the company refused to back down and withdraw the commercial from air, as demanded by some Aboriginal community leaders. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They have condemned the ad as distasteful and a commercial capitalisation of the political climate in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad, created by Sydney agency FCB, features 20 athletes, most of whom are contracted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , saying sorry for such things as being late, not having a nickname, eating all the eggs or for not being the girl next door because they are in training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cathy Freeman is the only athlete who does not say sorry, instead running past the camera, saying, "Can I get back to you later?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman, who married a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executive, Mr Sandy Bodecker, last year, is in London training for the Olympics. But other athletes who appear in the advertisement defended \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  apologetic theme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hammer thrower Debbie Sosimenko said: "I did the ad because I interpreted it as saying thank you to all the people that have been understanding of the demands on my time and helped me get where I am. It wasn't my intention to offend anyone in any way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brisbane rugby league player Gorden Tallis, who is Aboriginal, said he could not see what the fuss was about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't see any problem with the ad at all, Cathy Freeman is the biggest Aboriginal name in the world, and she is the focus of it and she doesn't have a problem with it, and so I don't."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Audrey Kinnear, of the National Sorry Day Committee, and Ms Lowitja O'Donoghue, of the Journey of Healing, have called for the commercial to be taken off air because, they say, it offends and hurts many Australians. Ms Kinnear said indigenous and non-indigenous Australians had been appalled at the commercial. "You would think the company would be more sensitive to Cathy at this stage leading up to the Olympics. It is heavy in our hearts to see she has been used this way ... It is very much distasteful and trivialises what `sorry' means to us."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials said they had no plans to change the advertisement or take it off air, but welcomed debate with Aboriginal groups on the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The ad is about showing an insight into the athletes and portraying the behind-the-scenes life of an athlete," a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman said. "The ad has nothing to do whatsoever with reconciliation."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SOCCER giants Manchester United are at the centre of a child slave labour scandal after signing a world-record pounds 300million sponsorship deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fans will be shocked to learn that kiddies as young as 12 are working for 75p a day in sweatshops to produce the famous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sports gear. At one slum factory in Cambodia, children toil seven days a week with dangerous machinery in searing heat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And Fiona King from Save the Children said: "Situations like this are all too common." United's 15-year deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  starts in 2002 and will net the club pounds 20million a season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One fan, a father of two, saidlast night: "I'm shocked that in their greed they have signed with a firm that exploits children."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The club's marketing boss Peter Draper said: "We are working with UNICEF to bring pressure on suppliers and ensure they work to guidelines."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said: "We deeply regret what happened in Cambodia and have pulled out of the factory concerned. It breached our code of conduct."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  BRISBANE-based AV Syntec Pty Ltd will use old athletics shoes in its famous Rebound Ace tennis court surfaces after striking a strategic alliance with US sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rebound Ace, one of only four Grand Slam tennis surfaces in the world, has been used at the Australian Open for the past 12 years and was installed at the NSW Tennis Centre for the Sydney Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now, under a deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , AV Syntec will incorporate into all its sports surfaces \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Grind -- the recycled rubber from old sports shoes collected through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reuse-a-shoe programme. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The deal is designed not to have any impact on the costing of our systems -- it is cost neutral," said Tony Newton, national product manager of AV Syntec's Rebound Ace Sports division.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But from a business perspective, certainly we are looking for brand strengthening from the alliance with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  . . . and we expect there to be a dollar benefit to us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The privately-owned company was formed in Brisbane in 1977 by three industrial chemists who patented their design for a cushioned surface made from polyurethane acrylic combinations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All the liquid materials, such as adhesives, used in the construction of the Rebound Ace surfaces are manufactured at AV Syntec's Carole Park factory, in Brisbane's south-west.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, it outsources all the pre-fabricated rubber mats, which are mostly made from recycled tyres and will now also include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Grind.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two thousand recycled tyres and 12,000 old shoes were recently used to produce two new multi-purpose courts and a play area at the South Sydney Police & Community Youth Club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That facility is the first Rebound Ace court in Australia to use \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Grind and one of 15 locations internationally, reflecting an informal tie between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and AV Syntec over several years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AV Syntec's sports surfaces division generates an estimated $5 million-plus a year in revenue, with exports to more than 40 countries accounting for roughly half of these sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The success of Rebound Ace in the Australian Open has really springboarded us around the world," Mr Newton said, noting that the major opportunities for Rebound Ace are overseas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the US, Mr Newton said AV Syntec wanted to leverage off \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strong ties with universities and colleges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In Australia and throughout the rest of the world we will look at improved sales through the brand strengthening aspect of having \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associated with AV Syntec."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods is making the switch to the swoosh. After testing a new golf ball during competition in Germany and in the Memorial, Woods said he formally will switch to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball when he plays the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in two weeks. Woods finished third in the Deutsche Bank Open, then won the Memorial. "I think it's done pretty good so far," he said last week. The announcement officially ends a marketing conflict between Woods' top sponsors - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist - that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ore., headquarters last summer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  CEO Phil Knight had assembled two dozen managers from across the company to figure out how it could leverage the Internet to grow its $\b \i0 \ul0 9 billion business. In earlier sessions, Knight had invited Net luminaries including Broadcast.com founder Mark Cuban and Novell (NOVL) chairman Eric Schmidt to join his brain trust to discuss various issues affecting the digital economy. Knight then personally drafted five case studies and put his lieutenants to work. Managers were split into teams, each assigned to a case. Topics included e-commerce, marketing and PR, general operations, finance and sports marketing.\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Phil said there were only two rules," recalls Ian Yolles, a participant in the sessions. "They were: 'One: I don't want you spending more than five hours on this. And two: I'm going to give you 50 bucks for beer and pizza to get it done.'"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The groups engaged in a kind of corporate soul-searching, exploring every conceivable scenario. What's our e-commerce strategy? Should we seek venture capital funding for a dot-com spinoff? What about a tracking stock? Should we divert more money into online advertising? Should we build a business-to-business exchange for our raw materials suppliers to cut down on manufacturing costs?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some ideas, such as the tracking stock, were scrapped. Others, including working with VCs, were moved to the back burner. And others got the green light; one of them, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  iD custom shoe-building feature, debuted in November. In the end, Knight and his team zeroed in on the Internet as a prime opportunity for investment and development.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The most significant thing about the seminars and the case studies was that it did exactly what Phil hoped it would do," says Yolles, director of marketing at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com. "It engaged people in the company to think about the Internet and the future of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight is making \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com the cornerstone of the company's global strategy. Once little more than a corporate brochure, the site now figures in just about every aspect of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  business, from PR to e-commerce to brand-building and even original programming. And the Net operation's momentum continues to build: It's at the heart of the company's new consumer electronics business, launched in early May. The first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -branded gadget to hit stores is a digital-audio device that plays MP3 files; soon to come are walkie-talkies and watches that double as heart-rate monitors and altimeters. Over time, each of the gadgets will become more compatible with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com, allowing for athletes in training, for instance, to download their heart-rate information to the site and pull up pointers from pros.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Driving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  innovations is the company's obsession with its image. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been a master marketer for three decades. Its ad campaigns sell more than shoes; they sell the idea that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes champions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Air Jordan basketball shoes, inspired by Michael Jordan, vaulted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to its spot as the most-dominant consumer sports brand of the mid '80s and early '90s. What Jordan did for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the last two decades, Knight thinks the Net can do for the brand now and in the near future. As he says, the Internet "has a power equal to [Jordan]" in the new millennium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More so than at any other time in its 32-year history, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs high-tech help. For the past two years, the "swoosh" brand has been in a swoon. Fickle teens have been turning away from white sneakers and toward Timberland hiking boots and skateboard brands like Vans (VANS) and Skechers (SKX) . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  problems overseas are equally daunting. Weak currencies in Europe and Asia are expected to depress sales in the very markets where the company was banking on the greatest growth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These factors have contributed to declining sales two years running. In February, the company warned analysts that revenue would fall short of estimates this year and next year due in part to the woes of its biggest retail partners, including Just for Feet and the Venator Group (Z) , the parent company of Foot Locker. The news sent the stock into a tailspin, shedding more than $\b \i0 \ul0 2 billion of its market cap.\b0 \i0 \ul0 \b \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (It has now recovered half that amount.)\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If your shirt smells after a good run, be thankful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. shirts in Europe are being recalled after a television report said they contain a chemical that can lead to infertility.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shirts in Canada do not contain the chemical, used to keep shirts from smelling like sweat, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Canada Ltd. says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''None of these jerseys are sold in Canada,'' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michelle McSorley said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In fact, she said, preliminary testing by the company yesterday showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not deliberately add the chemical in Europe, either, and that only a small batch of clothes from factories in Italy and Britain had the chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Complete test results should be available today, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shirts in question are replica soccer team shirts sold through two German clothing store chains. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made the shirts and sewed on logos provided by the soccer teams whose uniforms were being replicated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McSorley said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is investigating the possibility that the chemical got on to the shirts by way of the logos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''We certainly would not have added it,'' she said, adding that concentrations of the chemical are very low.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''This isn't a life or death situation.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chemical, tributyltin, is a fungicide that removes the smell created by the bacteria in sweat. It is often used in the shipping industry to control the growth of mould and mildew, said Thomas Kullick, an environmental spokesman for a European textile association.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The heavy metal compound is also used in anti-barnacle paint for ships, but has since 1989 been banned in Canada for environmental reasons for use on any ship less than 25 metres.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  German retailer KarstadtQuelle AG has pulled all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer shirts from its shelves, while Metro AG's Kaufhof Warenhaus AG department store unit stopped selling the soccer shirts and may pull the rest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''We're immediately removing all shirts from sale, until we know exactly what is going on,'' said Karstadt spokesperson Michael Scheibe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He estimated Karstadt has sold more than 10,000 of the shirts, which retail for about 140 deutsche marks ($110) apiece and are replicas of the Borussia Dortmund soccer team's yellow-and-black outfit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Karstadt will refund or exchange shirts it has sold but has not reached an agreement with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on who will pay the cost.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The risks and benefits of tributyltin have been debated for years. A study of 140 snail species has shown that a high concentration of the chemical caused infertility, sparking calls for a ban on its use.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 LOS ANGELES -- Tiger Woods has signed a five-year endorsement contract extension with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a company spokesman said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those close to the negotiations declined to discuss the financial terms of the contract, but the Associated Press cites ''a source close to the negotiations'' saying it was for $100 million and the largest contract in sports marketing history.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood said the only formality left in the yearlong negotiation process was receiving the signed contract in his office. He said he expected to receive it this morning. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''The negotiating has been done for several weeks now,'' Wood said. ''The only thing left is the logistics of physically having the contract here.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, said the contract had not yet been signed, but said the negotiations were complete and the signature was a mere formality.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''All of the deal points are in place,'' Steinberg said. ''There are very few times in a player or an endorser's life that both truly feel they got what they deserved. But, in this case, they do. I would venture to say that Tiger is very happy.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal, which calls for Woods to continue wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothes and using \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls, is comparable in length to any deal Michael Jordan had while he was an active player.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jordan's endorsement contract terms were never made public, but Wood hinted that Woods' package was worth more than anything Jordan made while he was an active NBA player.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earl Woods, Tiger's father, said he did not know the financial details of the contract, but said, if the $100- million speculation was correct, it was worth it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It doesn't surprise me at all,'' Earl Woods said. ''He's worth every bit of it. And when the next contract comes around, this one will look like chump change and peanuts compared to that one.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knight recently made news for suddenly withdrawing a contemplated $30-million gift to the University of Oregon after the university balked at joining a coalition - the Fair Labour Association (FLA) - that was formed by human-rights groups, colleges, the U.S. government and companies such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to alleviate global sweatshop conditions. Oregon opted to join an alternative group being pushed on college campuses, the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), which also plans to combat sweatshops but refuses to co-operate with any companies, such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shameful Past
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The natural assumption is that Knight is wrong. The truth is, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a shameful past when it comes to tolerating sweatshops. But on the question of how best to remedy those conditions in the future - which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has now agreed to do - Knight is dead right and Oregon wrong: the best way to create global governance - over issues from sweatshops to the environment - when there is no global government is to build coalitions, in which enlightened companies, consumers and social activists work together to forge their own rules and enforcement mechanisms. That's what the FLA represents and it's what the WRC doesn't. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We've heard plenty this year about the downsides of globalization. The question is what to do about it. The more radical protesters, such as the WRC, want to trash multinationals and get the World Trade Organization to set rules for workers and the environment, not just for trade. And what practical effect have the protesters had so far? Zero.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So what to do? Well, it comes down to this: do you want a make a point or do you want to make a difference? The FLA was formed to make a difference. The WRC was formed to make a point.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FLA was forged four years ago, and it now includes the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the National Council of Churches, the International Labour Rights Fund, 135 universities and major apparel companies such as Liz Claiborne, Levi Strauss, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reebok and Adidas. After long talks, this diverse group agreed on a nine-point code for any apparel factory anywhere in the world - including rules against forced labour and child labour, as well as freedom of association, minimum wages, maximum working hours, lighting, bathrooms and safety. They also agreed on a system of independent monitoring, surprise inspections and follow-ups, which is now being tested in five developing countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FLA Label
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Companies whose factories comply will be able to sew an ''FLA'' label into their clothing, and the 135 universities have agreed that their logos will go only on FLA- made products. Global brands can't afford any longer to be associated with sweatshops, and the FLA creates a credible system for empowering consumers to punish dirty companies and reward improving ones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WRC, by contrast, is backed by protectionist U.S. unions, such as Unite, that don't want any system that would give a stamp of approval to any production outside the United States. That's one reason the WRC won't work with companies. But that means the WRC has no way of consistently monitoring factories or following up remedies, and it is only focused on clothing sold on college campuses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's good that there's a WRC out there noisily protesting against sweatshops and embarrassing companies. But the WRC is not a substitute for the FLA, which has a comprehensive strategy for upgrading the whole apparel industry. It's a pity that some cowardly college presidents - intimidated by a few vocal and often uninformed students - have quit the FLA in favour of the WRC.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''If you want to improve people's lives in the absence of a global government, you need to align the economic interests of the better global companies with the social interests of the least advantaged people,'' said Sam Brown, the 1960s anti-war activist, former U.S. ambassador and now director of the FLA. ''We need to make these companies our allies, not our opponents. We won't change the world overnight. But it is foolish to dismiss the FLA because it does not go far enough or fast enough. The issue is how to get from here to there, and the FLA has a real strategy for harnessing U.S. consumer power to change the lives and working conditions of real people.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There's some kind of disconnect between a religious symbol and a company emblem," said Rabbi Andrew Bachman, a spiritual leader in New York. His colleague, Rabbi Yerachmeil Milstein, has said he will only permit the traditional black velvet in his school. The cap, he said, represents a relationship with God. "Somehow that message can get lost with all this brand noise. When it becomes this commercial, it loses its true significance."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The concern has become so intense that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been forced to deny it has anything to do with the trend. "The yarmulke, as venerable and noble an article of clothing as it is, is not something we sell among our performance athletic line," insisted Vado Manager, Director of Global Issues.He blamed unlicensed traders for the trend. However, to the dismay of rabbis, the company has made clear it does not plan to try too hard to halt the misuse of its copyright, otherwise known as free advertising.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EVER since Tiger Woods sported that cap with the simple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signature,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the red swoosh, every sportsman wants to wear that same "badge".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From being a brand promoting classy sportswear, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has since moved to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 introducing revolutionary sportswear and goods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Add a touch of glamour to your sweaty and grimy exercise routines with
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  full-length, yoga and workout pants. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Check out the stretchy lycra pants that gives the much desired slimmer
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 silhouette while not compromising on ease of movement. Who says we all
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 can't look like Jennifer Lopez?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And then there are the well-cut tops that provide support and optimum
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 comfort.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What lends character to the pieces are the fashionable construction and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 placement of straps, innovative stitching and seams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Aside from the workout theme clothes, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also brings other sports-
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 inspired tops. The sports brand's latest collection features tops that are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 comfortable and fashionable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fabrics used effectively keep sweat away, leaving the wearer dry
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 even after a strenous workout.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Check out the D.R.I. Fit Tees that keep that sticky feeling at bay.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From mock turtlenecks to boatnecks, necklines echo the styles of the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sleeves go from three-quarter to cap sleeves to flatter all body types.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The minimalist cuts further emphasise body parts that you want to show
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 off.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also introducing the revolutionary "Presto" sports shoe that is
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 described as the T-shirt for feet!
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It may be zany but it will give your precious feet the comfort they need
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in a kaleidoscope of colours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The revolutionary sizing exhibits the flexibility of the range. Once the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 laces are adjusted to the desired tightness, the shoe can be slipped on
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and off. No more struggling with pesky tangled laces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Women's tees are available at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -only stores. Head on down to the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Women's Specialty Store on the first floor of Bangsar Shopping Complex in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Kuala Lumpur.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And do pop by the newly-opened flagship store in KL Plaza (second floor)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 as it not only offers the largest selection in Malaysia, it also happens
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to be the largest store in Southeast Asia. Yet another exciting milestone
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  indeed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the launch of the flagship store, there was, in true \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  style,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 nothing predictable or ordinary. Interesting games were organised, where
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 winners took home \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  goodies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Game stalls were also set up where people could win a T-shirt or a flask
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 just by tossing a ball.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IF I were an NBA team owner outside of the Wizards, I'd be very unsettled by the news that Michael Jordan's in the ownership loop. After all, from the time Jordan was an NBA pup, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been right there, and in a big, big way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While long ago diagnosed as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -intolerant, I also learned that to underestimate the power and methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to miss the bigger picture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alonzo Mourning said it a few years back when his contract negotiations with the Hornets broke down after he was drafted. Asked which NBA team he planned to work for, Mourning said, "I work for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." Just like his college coach, John Thompson. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jordan, still \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  most valuable property, now doubles as part-owner and director of basketball operations of an NBA team. Hmmm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How long before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  becomes Jordan's silent but highly visible partner in the Wizards? How long before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  provides the Wizards a salary-cap end-run by paying huge endorsement fees to players in order to load the team with hand-picked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stars? Then, how long before Team \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  buys its way into the NBA Finals?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the pro level, such a precedent exists. In 1994, when Deion Sanders went from the Falcons to the 49ers, it was widely reported that he had to take a paycut to do so. It made for a sweet story, but it was nonsense.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sanders had his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  salary increased as a pre-determined element of the deal to join the Niners. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reasoned that the national exposure that Sanders would receive by playing for a contender instead of the miserable Falcons was worth its weight in cash.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made up the difference, and perhaps more, in Sanders' football salary. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as much as the Niners, was responsible for Sanders changing teams. And, not that Sanders made all the difference, but the Niners, with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  help, won the Super Bowl.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What prevents the Wizards, through Jordan, from serving as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -laundering operation in the same manner and then some? Technically, nothing. In fact, it's hard to imagine that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would not try to thoroughly exploit such an "in."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why not? Sneaker companies have met little resistance buying college programs. Many big-time Division I team basketball teams essentially operate as warehouse showrooms for sneaker company-owned players and coaches in return for sneaker company cash and recruits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And once the schools learned just who owns their coaches and players, once they learned the drill, did they stand up and demand that such influence peddling cease? Hell, no. They got in line for their cut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some colleges have sold exclusives to sneaker companies that disallow a stitch of clothing carrying the school's name or logo from being sold unless the merchandise shares the spotlight with the sneaker company's name or logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sneaker companies even try to make deals that include clauses through which the college agrees to prevent any negative publicity about the companies in school-operated media. Hush money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The largesse of the sneaker companies, what I'd call racketeering, the schools identify as "good corporate citizenship." Heck, the schools and sneaker companies would have you believe that until they showed up, everyone played basketball in their bare feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Remember, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has the power to force Olympic Dream Team members, including Jordan, to literally wrap themselves in American flags, not to express their national pride, but to cover the Olympic-issue Reebok logos on their uniforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And now Jordan, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all-time salesman, is doubling as a hands-on executive and part-owner of an NBA team. Why do I get the feeling that out there in Nikeland, Oregon, either someone's working on a plan, or the plan is ready to enter Phase II?

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A GROUP of Manchester United shareholders has warned the Premiership football club to be wary of entering into a multi-million pound partnership with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The call by Shareholders United follows allegations that the sportswear giant sub-contracts orders to a factory in Cambodia that employs children to work in sweat-shop conditions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United has been rumoured to be close to signing a 10-year commercial deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth nearly GBP 300million. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a letter to club chief executive Peter Kenyon, Shareholders United wrote: "United should not conclude any deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  until you are totally satisfied that it is 100 per cent clean on this issue the use of child labour ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The club has recently agreed a new charter with its supporters and shareholders which states: "Manchester United plc opposes the exploitation of child labour. No orders will be placed with suppliers employing child labour under the age allowed in the country concerned."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A recent BBC Panorama programme alleged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used a factory in Cambodia that employs children under the age of 15, the legal working age in the country. Shareholders United representative Michael Crick urged the club to make the most thorough investigation over a potential shirt supplier's records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It will not be good enough simply to take a potential partner's word for it," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman for United said yesterday it was inconceivable the club would enter into an agreement with a company if there was an alleged problem over use of child labour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or anybody else would have to convince Manchester United that it was doing all it could to eradicate this problem," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United backed a worldwide Unicef campaign against exploitative child labour, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shareholders United was formed during the controversial GBP 365million takeover bid for the group by satellite operator BSkyB.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In its early days the pressure group had a stormy relationship with the club's board, then led by Martin Edwards.Recently, however, the club has taken the views of the group more seriously. "The plc has taken a radically different approach to relations with shareholders and supporters over the past year," the group said on its website.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A runner's speedometer invented by a University of Alberta engineering professor has been snapped up by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as one of five new high-tech devices for the "digital athlete," the sports marketing giant announced Wednesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The device, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will sell with a version of its popular Triax wristwatch for $199 US starting in October in the United States and likely soon after that in Canada, consists of sensors and a microprocessor designed to clip on to shoelaces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a sophisticated, wireless gadget measuring stride length and velocity. It transmits the information to the watch, which gives constant speed and distance readouts. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken Fyfe, who teaches mechanical engineering at the U of A, came up with the idea a few years ago while talking with his wife, Anne Galloway, about ideas for a design project to give his students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A veteran marathon runner, she suggested something to help runners improve their training. Fyfe, also a runner and coach of the Leduc Track club, decided he would work on it himself rather than give it to his students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He later formed Dynastream Innovations Inc. with his younger brother Kip, an electrical engineer in Cochrane, to further develop prototypes and shop them around to sports equipment manufacturers, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fyfe said his invention, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is labelling the SDM (Speed Distance Monitor) Triax 100, is a big improvement over the typical pedometer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A pedometer simply counts how many steps you take and then uses what you say is your average stride length to tell you how far you've gone, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This thing is actually measuring each and every stride. So even if you change your stride length, this calculates that." The device has an accuracy of more than 97 per cent.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vice-president Clare Hammil said: "The simple question when you go out for a run, go for a walk, you're out hiking, is how far did I go and how fast did I move?"
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  created a new division -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Techlab -- to market the new products including a heart monitor, a portable digital audio player, a backcountry wristwatch that will act as a compass and provide weather readings, and a new two-way radio for snowboarders, hikers and the like.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fyfe said getting the product to this stage has been long and sometimes difficult. Some of the research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. The university's industry liaison office helped him get a patent and provided some money to develop prototypes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At one point the Fyfes' company ran out of money and they had to shut it down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kip ran the company out of his garage, said Fyfe. And a meeting with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials was conducted around a kitchen table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It has literally been running on a shoestring, no pun intended," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "So many roadblocks had to be overcome. But it has been a lot of fun to work on. What better way to do your research than put this thing on and go outside to run for an hour."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IN THE LONG RUN...
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - U of A professor Ken Fyfe's invention will first be marketed to runners who want to find out how fast and far they're going.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - But down the road it could be used to help people with artificial limbs enhance their sense of motion and position.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has reached agreement with Tiger Woods to pay him a reported $ 100m - the richest endorsement in the history of sport. Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, of the International Management Group, said yesterday the deal, covering a five -year period to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worldwide brand leader, would be signed within the next few days.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It is a very, very fair deal, which compensates Tiger for what he has done, not just for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but for the game of golf," said Steinberg. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I cannot imagine there has ever been a more creative contract, there are so many different parameters. He is setting standards and marks that have never been thought of - on and off the course."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  paid Woods $ 40m when he turned professional five years ago and were rewarded with a rise in global sales and profits through his increasing dominance in golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The value received now will be a bargain when next time comes around," insisted his father, Earl, who controls his son's financial investments. "There is no doubt he is going to get better. He is far from reaching his potential.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This reflects the growing nature of Tiger in the world market. But it is not about money with him, and it never will be about money."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods Sr argued that other players would not benefit from increased sponsorship, because of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  benchmark deal. "My gut feeling is that Tiger is so special and unique, that what he accomplishes in the markets has no effect on others," he maintained. "Where his impact will be is in the next television contract. That is where the players will capitalise."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The US PGA Tour was able
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  to double purses after
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  renegotiating television contracts two years ago. When these are up for renewal the Tour will be in a much stronger bargaining position, because TV ratings for golf in the USA have risen steeply thanks to Woods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to his associaties, Woods made $ 50m last year from all sources and his net worth was calculated to be $ 150m. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal will take him significantly closer to becoming sport's first

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger Woods, winner of the last three major championships and four of the last five, has signed the richest endorsement contract in the history of sport - for $ 100 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That is what it has cost \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to retain his services to September 2006, and yesterday the president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, Bob Wood, said: "We are really, really happy. We have a comprehensive agreement that covers Tiger from head to toe, plus using our golf ball." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The contract is said by the American magazine Golfweek to be "far beyond anything Michael Jordan received". Quoting a scource close to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it went on: "This is absolutely the richest-ever sporting endorsement. Nothing has ever been close."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not that it unduly impresses Earl Woods, Tiger's father. When his son turned professional in August 1996 the golfing world gasped when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  paid $ 40m for his signature. But Earl, with an eye to the future, described that sum as being only "chump change" and yesterday he was similarly guarded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The next contract," he said, "in 2006 will make that $ 100 million look like a bargain. There's no doubt that Tiger is going to get better, he's far from having reached his potential. This deal reflects the growing stature of Tiger in world sports, and that is just going to continue to grow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has already won nine tournaments on the US Tour this year, the first to reach that mark since Sam Snead won 11 in 1950, and at St Andrews this year he became the youngest man ever to win a career grand slam when he won the Open by eight shots.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prior to that he had won the 2000 US Open by 15 shots, and his first major championship, the US Masters in 1997, was won by 12 shots. Only in the US PGA of 1999, when he was chased to the line by Sergio Garcia before winning by one shot, was the slam in any danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He has ruled world golf in the past two years and, as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has discovered, such brilliance has its price. There is even scope for extending that contract because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as of now, does not make golf clubs, and so that aspect of the Woods career is not covered by the current agreement. But it is anticipated that they will start, and when they do it will doubtless cost them yet more millions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The scale of the new contract is bad news for the television companies in America who will shortly have to renegotiate their contract to cover the US Tour. The Tour organisers will be sure to capitalise on the fact that ratings soar whenever Tiger is anywhere near contention and will demand yet another huge increase, so enabling prize funds to go up yet again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That in turn could be bad news for the European Tour which is already losing many of its best players to America, after the last round of TV talks produced purses of between (pounds) 3m and (pounds) 5m sterling for many events in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If that figure were to rise substantially yet again then even players like Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and Colin Montgomerie might be tempted to play more in the States, diminishing the attraction of European events.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Known for its edgy and sometimes controversial ads, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has stirred up a tempest in the U.S. because of its new Olympic commercial featuring a chainsaw-wielding maniac chasing a scantily-clad female athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC, the American broadcaster of the Games, has pulled the Horror ad -- part of the Why Sport? campaign -- off the air. Horror features U.S. 1,500-metre runner Suzy Hamilton being pursued through a house and dark woods by a man sporting a mask, similar to the one the Jason character wears in the Friday the 13th flicks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unlike most horror movies, where the killer easily catches up with the beautiful victim, even though she's in a flat-out run and he's limping along, Ms. Hamilton gets a burst of energy and easily dashes to safety as the bad guy slogs off in defeat. The line at the end of the cheeky ad concludes, ''Why Sport? You'll live longer.'' 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The network received hundreds of complaints that said the ad is misogynistic and promotes violence against women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia says the ad was yanked because of ''adverse audience reaction.'' The network, she says, had concerns about the ad even before it aired.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We made it very clear to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that we were accepting the ad with a strong provision that we would monitor audience reaction,'' Ms. Battaglia said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ads will no longer run on NBC, CNBC or MSNBC, though two other ads in the Why Sport? series -- one featuring U.S. Olympic cyclist and two-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on an elephant, and another that portrays a battle between a gladiator and a skateboarder -- will continue to be seen on the network. The ads were never sent to CBC, but ESPN continues to run all three of the commercials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is not the first time \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come into trouble with Olympic-time commercials. During the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  enraged some Olympic athletes with such in-your-face slogans as, ''You don't win the silver, you lose the gold,'' and, ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of Atlanta.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  employees handed out ''Just Do It U.S.A.'' signs in ad-free zones, putting bees in the bonnets of Olympic officials. Fans, officials worried, were giving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  free exposure by flashing signs that incorporated the famous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  slogan during televised events.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Scott Reames, a spokesman at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, says \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been on the vanguard of the advertising world with its edgy campaigns. He says the company expected a strong reaction from the Horror commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''People expect that from us,'' Mr. Reames says. ''I don't think (consumers) expect us to deliver cheesy, safe, bland advertising . .. for us to create ads with puppy dogs, flowers and cheery music. That's just not who we are.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Reames said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't trying to offend or make light of violence against women. ''In our view, Suzy Hamilton is the victor, not the victim because of her athleticism.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And though \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has fielded complaints regarding the ad, it has received compliments, too.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''One woman called and said, 'I'm a runner. This is fantastic. Thank you for not portraying us as weak and scared,' '' Mr. Reames said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anne Hale, a marketing professor at the University of Victoria, disagrees. She said the message of a happy outcome gets lost in the slasher-film cliche, and she wondered whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tested the ad with women. ''It does reinforce (the idea) of women as victims. It's a good outcome, but the parametres are still a male aggressor and female victim. That is the stereotype that I think women, as a rule, are getting very tired of.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said it's also inappropriate for that violent an ad to be shown during the Olympics, when a lot of young children are watching.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The hijacking of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc.'s Web site last month has sparked an international argument over whether the footwear company or Internet domain-name registrar Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) should bear responsibility for the temporary theft of www.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 On June 21, a group calling itself S-11 redirected traffic from www.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com to servers at a Web hosting company in a slap at both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the World Economic Forum. Now, the hosting firm is threatening legal action against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Greg Lloyd Smith, director of FirstNet Online (Management) Ltd. in Edinburgh, said the wayward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  traffic swamped his company's Web servers and impaired service to its real customers. After unsuccessfully trying to bill \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for use of his company's servers, Smith said he's preparing to sue the Beaverton, Ore.-based company for neglecting to secure its Internet domain. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Blame-Shifting
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in turn, said responsibility lies with NSI in Herndon, Va. Changes to the status of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  domain name are supposed to be made only via NSI's security system, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Corby Casler. But NSI allowed S-11's spoofed e-mail to change \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  registry without requiring a password, she claimed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Casler added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has locked down any further changes to its registration information at NSI. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also working with the FBI and local police in Oregon "to see exactly what happened and who is liable," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Smith disputed the claim by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that it had access to the Crypt-PW encryption system through NSI, and he charged that the footwear maker subscribed to a level of security that lets changes to its information be made from an approved e-mail address. "A responsible company would not deny the fact that their domain was stolen because they did not have satisfactory security in place," Smith said via e-mail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 However, Casler insisted that Smith's claims are inaccurate and said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't consider itself liable for the unintended usage of FirstNet's Web servers. Smith "did try to bill us for it, and our response is we are both victims and the real problem is [with] whoever it was who hacked into the system," Casler said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Smith got into a legal battle with Amazon.com Inc. last year after the company won an injunction against him for using the Amazon.gr domain name in Greece in an alleged attempt to coerce a partnership. But Smith rejected any suggestion of complicity against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "Our involvement was as an injured party," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NSI, which declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  domain theft, has been criticized for similar thefts, including the heist of 1,300 domains from New York-based Internet.com in May. Alan Meckler, chairman and CEO of Internet.com, said NSI told his company that its information had been changed by forged documents sent via fax.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NSI officials "deny that it's their fault," Meckler said. "But the fact is that if you pay [NSI], you are presuming that in the morning the last thing you have to worry about is whether you own your domains."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 But Connie Ellerbach, a partner at Fenwick and West, a law firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said past case law indicates that NSI wouldn't be liable for the theft because it's merely a conduit for domains and takes no responsibility for their validity or for changes in domain-name registrations. A recent domain theft suit brought against NSI by Sex.com was settled in favor of the registrar, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Ellerbach added, though, that it would also be difficult for FirstNet to prove that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was negligent. "How is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  going to police registration of a domain and keep them from spoofing or fooling NSI?" w

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MANCHESTER United could be sued by sportswear manufacturer Umbro over revelations that the Reds have agreed a record-breaking kit deal with US giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  Legal experts believe Umbro have the potential for a substantial claim for damages against United, running into tens of millions of pounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bosses at Umbro, which recently moved from Wythenshawe to Cheadle, have retained a dignified silence since news of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal emerged.  But, privately, they are furious that it became public knowledge with almost two years remaining on their deal with the Premier League champions. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Umbro fears that sales of replica United shirts between now and the end of next season - when its contract expires - will be seriously damaged.  United confirmed in a short statement to the Stock Exchange late last month that it was in negotiations with a major sportswear manufacturer'' after the media got wind of the deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An announcement had been expected two weeks ago, when United posted its annual results, but it is understood \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were not ready to complete the deal.  Today Umbro was remaining tight-lipped on its plans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Head of marketing Martin Prothero said he was unable to confirm or deny'' that the company, which also supplies the England kit to the Football Association, had taken legal advice.  We are in constant discussions with Manchester United. The nature of these discussions are confidential,'' Mr Prothero said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  News of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal came as a bitter blow to Umbro which has had strong links with Manchester United over many years.  Reds chief executive Peter Kenyon and group marketing director Peter Draper both joined the club from Umbro's ranks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Kenyon was today not immediately available for comment.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which sponsors the likes of golf superstar Tiger Woods, seems determined to strike a deal with Manchester United.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The world's richest soccer club is also arguably the leading global sports brand.  The reported deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is expected to be worth a staggering GBP 20m a year over 15 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The previous record sponsorship deal also involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and was GBP 65m for a 10-year link up with the Brazilian football association.  Sports lawyer Lee Brierley, a partner at law firm DLA in Manchester said: Normally, these contracts have a clause in them which prevents the football club from announcing a new supplier until before the end of the contract.  Umbro will be looking at their contract and will have to prove that they suffered a loss in sales and profits.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE business of sport is costing football fans a small fortune.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since multinational sportswear labels \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Puma and adidas stitched up endorsement deals with clubs from all codes, fans have been left to pay a higher price to dress like their heroes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Supporters of rugby league, Australian rules, rugby union and soccer can expect to pay up to $150 for a jersey in their team's colours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tony Kaye, owner of the Rugby League Megastore, Darlinghurst, which carries official merchandise for league, union and AFL, says the price of supporters' gear has risen in line with the explosion in player payments and American-style marketing of our
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Global brands such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Reebok have outbid local manufacturers for exclusive rights to sell official merchandise of the AFL and NRL.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Kaye said: "They are paying big licensing fees and it's out of the reach of most Australian companies to compete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Accordingly, because the money is so big, it's got to come from somewhere and it's usually the fan who pays."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sportswear sales assistant Scott Daly said: "While clubs are paying players $600,000 the league has to make its money somehow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Mr Daly, who worked in the buying program of rugby league merchandise for Grace Bros for two years, said garment quality had risen with the prices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Parents decking out their children in their favourite team's colours won't get much change from $100, including a replica kids-size jumper selling for about $75, shorts $18 and socks $8.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NRL fans have been hit hardest, with prices varying from $129 to $149 depending on the endorsement deals each club has with a sportswear manufacturer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NSW and Queensland State of Origin jerseys cost less under a deal struck by the Australian Rugby League.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the NRL is believed to take a licensing fee of about 20 per cent from each official item sold, the ARL takes a smaller fee, keeping prices for adult jerseys below $100.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 RUGBY $100

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 LONDON -- An English designer has developed a full-length sprinter's body suit that could make it harder for British and Canadian athletes to win in the 2000 Olympic Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Swift Suit, which was used for the first time in competition last weekend by U.S. track star Marion Jones, raises the prospect of a hooded army of runners marching on the Olympics in Sydney in September.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eddie Harber, 33, a Londoner with a degree in fashion from East London University, has been working since 1997 on a suit that its manufacturer, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims offers unparalleled benefits by managing muscle temperature and reducing drag. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit, which has been cleared for use by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, will be available to national teams at the Olympics, but only those sponsored by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The Canadian and Great Britain teams are sponsored by Adidas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The U.S. and Australia teams are sponsored by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, if the suit proves effective, competitors will find it even harder to beat American Maurice Greene, the world-record holder in the 100 metres. The world's second-fastest sprint hurdler behind Britain's Colin Jackson is Allen Johnson, another potential hooded hero from the U.S., and the favourite in the women's 400 metres is Cathy Freeman, from Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jones, the reigning women's world champion in the 100 metres, gave the suit its first public test in the Prefontaine Classic at Eugene, Oregon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Warm muscles are essential to sprinting. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  says the suit manages muscle temperature by using darker colours on certain body zones to absorb radiant heat from the sun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Drag reduction, the manufacturer says, has been achieved by using differently textured fabrics, the effect of which is said to be similar to that of dimples on a golf ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why the hoods?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Hair is a very unaerodynamic surface,'' Harber said. ''We measured and compared hair styles in the wind tunnel and put hoods over them. There was nearly a pound more drag with a large wig versus the hood. Shaved heads aren't bad, but we can engineer textiles that are more aerodynamic than the skin.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The potential benefit is seen as less than that gained by the controversial Fastskin suit that many swimmers will wear when the Olympics begin on Sept. 15. Although the Fastskin suit counts as equipment because it is a performance aid, the Swift Suit is being regarded as mere apparel. The latter suit will not be on sale, but has been valued at about $1,800 Cdn.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That could be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  slogan as the sneaker giant pulls controversial
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ads to fend off protests.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has always been a controversial marketer. From its edgy ads
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to its ambush marketing of the Olympic Games, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has cultivated
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 an image as a bad boy of the marketing world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the swoosh has come under attack recently: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has yanked
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 two ads deemed offensive by consumers and is battling a lawsuit
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 over another.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And the company's recent trials should be a lesson to other marketers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 on how consumers can turn the speed of the Web against Corporate
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 America via e-mail campaigns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Consumers are becoming very vocal. Before, they had to go through
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 channels. Now, the Internet gives accessibility they've never
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 had before," says consumer trends analyst Tom Julian of Fallon
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've certainly hit a rough patch," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Scott Reames
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 says. "They say bad things come in threes. From a PR standpoint,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 we're hoping these are the three." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recent stumbles with
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 consumers:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pulled a print ad for Air Dri Goat running shoes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 after an uproar that the ad insults people with disabilities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The parody ad says the shoe prevents runners from slamming into
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 trees and becoming "a drooling, misshapen, non-extreme-trail-running
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 husk of my former self, forced to roam the earth in a motorized
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 wheelchair with my name embossed on one of those cute little license
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 plates you get at carnivals or state fairs fastened to the back."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  posted a public apology on its Web site. "There's nothing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 funny about this ad. It should have been stopped," Reames says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dan Wieden, head of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad agency Wieden Kennedy, says: "We
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 have stepped over the line with this advertisement, and there
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is no excuse for it. We have hurt a group of people for whom we
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 have enormous admiration. These are men and women who demonstrate
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 more courage in a single day than most of us will in our lifetime."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That controversy also showed the Web's power as a protest tool.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  went from zero to 172 e-mail complaints in a weekend. "The
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 explosion of the Internet means people can mobilize quickly,"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Reames says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * NBC dumped \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "chain saw" movie parody, starring
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Olympic sprinter Suzy Hamilton, after complaints. Hamilton told
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the press in Sydney, Australia: "We didn't want to make people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 uncomfortable. We wanted to make people laugh. I'd do the ad again."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is being sued by singer Billy Paul for using the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 song \b0 \i \ul0 Me and Mrs. Jones\b0 \i0 \ul0  in a recent spot starring Olympic
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 superstar Marion Jones. Paul alleges \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Wieden & Kennedy
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 used it without consent and seeks $ 1 million in damages. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 denies the claims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some argue \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been asking for it with in-your-face ads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been bothering people for a long time. But it's never
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 reached a point where they had to pull stuff," creative development
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 expert Michael Markowitz says.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not alone. Consumers have gone after ads from companies
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 as diverse as Campbell Soup and FedEx to Taco Bell and Benetton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The rising tide of consumer beefs could have a chilling effect
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 on the ad industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The result, marketing experts warn, could be "invisible advertising"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 -- ads that don't offend but don't grab attention and sell, either.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a doom loop," says Ken Harris of marketing consultants
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Cannondale Associates. "Marketers have to try to break through
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with risky ads. But consumers have more ways of fighting back
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than ever before."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What's next for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ? "We'll take risks but smarter risks,"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Reames says. "If we see there's a potential for controversy,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 we'll ask if it's a controversy we're ready to deal with."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IN their early incarnations, Internet retailers were chided for spending more time creating pretty and entertaining sites than actually delivering quality products, on time, to the right place. Duly chastened, they spent 1999 building stronger fulfillment and customer service systems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now that those systems are mainly in place, many Web merchants are devoting an increasing amount of time and money to implementing audio and video features -- hoping to provide so entertaining an experience that users will stay glued to the computer, credit cards at the ready. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  These companies are taking advantage of faster connection speeds and better technologies from audio and video providers to feed users a multimedia experience that would have choked their computers as recently as a year ago. But while technology is making it easier for sites to create that experience, retailers are still grappling with hard questions about how much media to mix with their commerce.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's a very fine line between offering an entertaining interactive experience and alienating people who aren't as tech savvy or who may not have the connection speed to make it work well," said Ian Yolles, vice president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 com. "It's a very delicate balance."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  audio and video efforts have been steadily building since the site's official rollout last summer. Now \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 com includes several multimedia programs, the most notable example being the company's "Cliffhanger" promotion that worked in conjunction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  television ads. The ads showed famous athletes involved in chase scenes, and directed viewers to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Web site to see various endings of the scenes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Yolles said the campaign was somewhat risky because it required "a certain amount of technical sophistication" on the part of the users, including the most up-to-date software for viewing Internet multimedia presentations. "And the higher the bandwidth, the better the performance," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But we're interested in the younger consumer," Mr. Yolles said, noting that those types of consumers are more apt to have both high-speed connections -- as do most college students -- and the newest software. "So we really hit that sweet spot."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the strength of that and other multimedia presentations, Mr. Yolles said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  traffic to the site increased 50 percent in January over the previous month, "and we expect the same in February." Mr. Yolles declined to cite sales figures, but said "the risk really paid off for us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and chairwoman of Shop .org, an industry trade group, "users are going to see a lot more of this type of thing in the future," as Web sites try to emulate the store environments made popular by Barnes & Noble and NoodleKidoodle, a toy store "where you take the kids when there's nothing to do, and oh, by the way, buy four or five things while you're there."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms. Rubin said that on the simplest level, e-commerce sites were starting to include background music, just as stores do. Barnes & Noble's online store (www.bn.com), for instance, recently rolled out its "BN Radio" feature, enabling users to listen to a selection of background music while browsing. Notably, the feature allows users to continue listening as they surf other sites, since the audio technology, made by RealNetworks, streams music in the background of the Web browser's software.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We also see extending this to other areas," said Daniel Blackman, vice president of music, video and software for Barnesandnoble.com. "People could listen to a tax expert give advice while they are looking at tax software."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since a "buy" button displays the artist or speaker featured in the audio, Mr. Blackman said, "It not only extends our brand, but it's a fantastic way to capitalize on the impulse buy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Such virtues aside, Ms. Rubin said e-commerce sites must approach multimedia with caution. "Sites that are doing this have been careful, as they ought to be, to put audio and video in parts of their site where users can choose to use it or avoid it if they just want to shop," Ms. Rubin said. "Otherwise you'll lose them."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One site giving users that choice is Victoria's Secret (www.victoriassecret.com), which analysts say is at least partly responsible for the growing interest in multimedia entertainment in e-commerce. The company's online fashion show in February 1999 attracted such a swarm of visitors that some users were not able to access the site at the time. And even though viewers were not given the chance to purchase lingerie directly from the fashion show, traffic to the site remained high for weeks following the Webcast, as did sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret, said the company would hold another online fashion show in May, and planned to let visitors purchase the clothing being modeled as the show proceeded. Meanwhile, he said, the site's Glam Lounge currently offers visitors a selection of multimedia presentations that changes regularly; this month's feature is a behind-the-scenes video of models during a photo shoot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other e-commerce executives note the power of multimedia. Matt Hyde, vice president of online sales for Recreational Equipment Inc. (www.rei.com), acknowledged that in recent multimedia tests "most people, when given the option, chose to look at nonmultimedia." And yet, those who did choose to view video product presentations bought "significantly more" than those who did not view the video, he said. "So we're still figuring out how to do it so there's a real benefit to the customer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As are many others. Companies like AudioBase, RealNetworks and Yahoo Broadcast (formerly Broadcast.com), all of which provide Internet multimedia services, have seen a recent surge in interest from e-commerce companies. AudioBase, which sells audio services to sites including those of Nickelodeon and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., charges between $750 and $27,500 a month, depending on the total number of hours of music use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 RealNetworks, which provides multimedia services for Gap and Holland America Line, charges $3,000 a month to start, with rates increasing "drastically from there, with more customization," according to a spokeswoman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yahoo Broadcast, which conducted the Victoria's Secret fashion show, as well as a Webcast of a Cranberries concert on Ford Motor's site, charges between $7,500 and $100,000, depending on the extent of production assistance required.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For retailers with their roots in merchandising, not media, expenditures like that may be difficult to swallow. But according to at least one e-commerce executive, retailers should prepare themselves for a new online environment. Chris Edgar, chief operating officer of Delia's Inc. (www.delias.com), a retail and catalog company geared toward girls and young women, is trying to gauge the extent to which his company's Web site will include multimedia entertainment in the future.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The battle cry of making shopping fun again requires retailers to do it," Mr. Edgar said. "And we recognize we have to run our merchandizing business like a media business."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Still, "you have to be careful not to tell consumers the reason they should buy something is that they can see someone famous on the site," he said. "Successful marketing of a product still ultimately relies on the quality of the product."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In advertising circles they call it "ambush marketing" but in the boardrooms of Qantas and adidas it's all about being smarter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Much to the annoyance of official sponsors Ansett and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , shrewd marketing by Qantas and adidas has resulted in the average Australian incorrectly naming the companies as official supporters of the Games. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A survey of 1,000 people living in capital cities conducted in June and July by Melbourne-based Sweeney Research found that adidas ranked seventh and Qantas eighth among the top 10 most-recognised Olympic sponsors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Official sponsor Ansett ranked third and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sixth, while Telstra topped the list ahead of equal second-place getters AMP and McDonald's. Westpac came in fourth, Coca-Cola fifth, Visa ninth and Channel 7 10th.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Both Ansett and Qantas are enjoying the benefits of being associated with the Olympics but only Ansett had to pay the huge sum to be a sponsor," a Sydney-based sponsorship consultant, Ms Kim Skildum-Reid, said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I think a lot of sponsors have missed an opportunity and wasted a lot of money becoming sponsors. Qantas is always going to kick Ansett's arse because the company is a natural ambusher. They have the right positioning, being the Australian airline ... even their tagline, the Spirit of Australia, is in line with the Games's Share the Spirit."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Qantas, which had sponsored the Olympics for 40 years but ended its association after the Atlanta Games, has spent the interim signing up high-profile Olympic athletes, including Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent weeks, giant billboards featuring the likes of Freeman under the Qantas logo and Spirit of Australia slogan have been going up around Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Similarly, adidas has successfully aligned itself with the Games through sponsorship of Ian Thorpe and the controversial swimsuit that created headlines earlier in the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 International Olympic Committee rules prohibit non-sponsors associating themselves with Olympics and Olympians during the Games. Qantas has assured the Australian Olympic Committee that its billboards will come down before the Sydney opening ceremony.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An Ansett spokesman said the airline had met its objectives from its estimated $50 million Olympic sponsorship, which he claimed did not include public awareness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've been very successful in using it as an incentive to win and retain major accounts with many of our larger corporate customers," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It has also helped boost staff morale significantly. We would have been naive to think we could wipe 40 years' association Qantas has had with the Olympics."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reebok International is in talks with the NFL over a blockbuster apparel rights deal, The Post has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The talks center on a possible exclusive apparel license for Reebok, including all authentic game uniforms, sideline apparel and replica jerseys, said people familiar with the talks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NFL sold $1.8 billion worth of licensed apparel last year, industry figures show. A deal with the mighty NFL can lift Reebok - the No. 3 U.S. sneaker brand, with $2.9 billion in sales last year - out of a years-long slump. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the NFL and Reebok refused to comment on any possible ongoing talks, whispers surrounding the negotiations say the two sides are also swapping proposals about the NFL getting stock or stock options in Reebok.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are currently evaluating all our options as they relate to our consumer products business," an NFL spokesman told The Post. "We are not going to comment on specific plans."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Getting equity in a licensee, which would be a first for the NFL, highlights the league's innovative thinking and team owners' never-ending search for increased revenues. It also points up the stagnant nature of the licensing business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The league's current apparel licensing deals - with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Puma and Adidas - expire at the end of the season. Any Reebok deal will begin with the 2001 season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reebok's occupation of the inside track on the NFL deal is the third piece of evidence that the long-suffering sneaker and apparel company may finally be ready to climb off the canvas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canton, Mass.-based outfit got some marketing mileage by aligning its brand with the highly successful CBS program "Survivor." Reebok is also getting high marks from retailers on its latest sneaker collection.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This has to be good news for Reebok shareholders who have seen their stock drop 80 percent since December 1994. In 1994, Reebok's market share was in the mid-20s and trailed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by just a few percentage points. Today, Reebok owns just 12 percent of the U.S. sneaker business, while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  slice has more than 40 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ironically, it was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ego that re-opened the NFL licensing door for Reebok.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had hoped to take over the entire NFL licensing game, but its offer to the NFL was said to be "insultingly low," sources told The Post. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed it was the only game in town, a person familiar with the talks said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead of rushing at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  offer, the NFL pivoted to Reebok. But don't expect Puma and Adidas to simply roll over. Both companies are still in the picture, although Reebok is in the driver's seat, people say.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman's decision to race in full bodysuit was a psychological masterstroke, her coach Peter Fortune said yesterday, while the suit's maker will see it as a face-saver and a huge commercial bonus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman had worn the regulation team-issue two-piece outfit during the opening three rounds of her 400m, before changing into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bodysuit for the final.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman's decision to race in full bodysuit was a psychological masterstroke, her coach Peter Fortune said yesterday, while the suit's maker will see it as a face-saver and a huge commercial bonus.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stock plunged for a second day on earnings worries, smaller rival Puma went the other way -- it jumped 7 percent, after the German athletic wear maker said 1999 earnings more than doubled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Puma shares closed at $15.88, up 50 cents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Puma also said its order backlog, an indicator of future sales, soared 40 percent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Puma appears to be shaking off the prolonged slump that is gripping most of the athletic wear industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its stock soared 49 percent last year; it opened a flagship store in Los Angeles, and the company is considering another one in New York City, and analysts say more retailers are adding its products all the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company has plenty of buzz, too, thanks to the recent launch of Christy Turlington's yoga wear line and the red-hot career of Puma spokesperson Serena Williams. Boxer Oscar De La Hoya is also an endorser of Puma.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why does Puma look so hot when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appears to be cooling?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Buzz is part of it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Analysts say teenagers, who buy most of the athletic shoes and apparel, see Puma's clothing as more of a fashion statement than something to play basketball in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's not a lot of new technology right now, so fashion has become even more important," said retail consultant Alison Boswell. "And right now kids are drawn to these kind of cleaner retro looks."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Boswell says Puma has also been persuading increasing numbers of athletic chains, specialty and department stores to carry its products in the last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Puma is also benefiting in comparison to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of its relatively low market share and its status as a comeback kid.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Just two years ago, Puma was struggling itself and had virtually disappeared from the U.S. market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And all of its growth has bought it just about 1 percent of the U.S. market for athletic wear -- so there is plenty of room for increases.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , by contrast, has 43 percent of the market here, and analysts say it could be close to saturation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lost another $3.25 to $33.75 yesterday, bringing its two day loss to $10.75.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tuesday's $7.50 loss was its biggest one-day drop in 17 years.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shocked investors when it said 1999 earnings would fall short of Wall Street's expectations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Oregon-based company blamed store closings at the Foot Locker chain and the bankruptcy of Just for Feet for its troubles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A slew of analyst downgrades followed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there are still some faithful, who point out that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still growing -- and they expect profit growth in the mid-teens for 2,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early word on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fall fashions is good, and its women's fashions, which are about 20 percent of its business and growing, are selling well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Shanley of First Security Van Kasper is one of the believers. He raised his rating on the stock and gave it a 12 month price target of $60.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE sporting goods manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  admitted last night that football shirts and replica kits worn by thousands of children in Britain contain a toxin identified in German soccer shirts. But the company, which has launched urgent tests of all its sports shirts, denied there was any danger to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Laboratory tests carried out by a German television channel this week found that shirts worn by the football team Borussia Dortmund, manufactured by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Britain, contained trace levels of TBT. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Three German department store chains have withdrawn the yellow and black shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In industrial use TBT is used on the underside of ships' hulls to keep them clean. It is also an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent used in some textiles. High levels of exposure can cause neurological problems, damage the immune system, cause breathing difficulties, skin irritation and birth defects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last night said it had carried out its own tests, which confirmed low levels of TBT were present, but in such low levels as to pose no health risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company said: "We are treating this really seriously, but the levels are so low there is no cause for concern." It was puzzled how TBT came to be in the shirts, as it was not used at any stage in production.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which produces shirts for Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers, has contacted the clubs to reassure them there is no danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  British and Dutch marine biologists have shown that TBT can cause mutations in marine snails, and there have been calls for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, Professor Michael Braungart of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency, based in Hamburg, said: "At no time has there been any risk from wearing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shirt. In seafood, for instance in clams from the North Sea, the contamination of TBT is up to 10 to 20 times higher than in the sports shirt."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Olympics 'horror' ad repulsive
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a parent, grandparent and community pediatrician, I am very sensitive to violence-loaded programming that is shamelessly doled out to us and our children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the midst of enjoying the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympics, I was shocked and then repulsed by the "horror" commercial promoting the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Corp. This comes just at a time when media violence is again being studied by Congress. NBC and ESPN deserve credit for withdrawing the commercial.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. is a corporate giant, a major Olympic sponsor. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisements have been recognized with Clio awards and even an Emmy. We know their commercial messages can be more creative. Yet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chose to present a horror style film clip against the backdrop of the Olympics our modern day attempt to promote global peace and unity and harmony. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It did this to millions of viewers. How many of those viewers are impressionable young men? How many young women were unnerved seeing the "horror" commercial? Surely the corporate leaders of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can wield their influence in a more constructive and influential manner. Public concern about violence in the media is not a coincidence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This violent commercial detracts from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  promotions for a healthy life style. Marketing and advertising boost name recognition. We all recognize the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh. But with ads like "horror," the swoosh may now repel conscience-minded consumers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ad empowers women
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I completely disagree with the column Ellen Goodman wrote Sept. 26 regarding the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisement titled "Horror." I thought the ad was great.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was so nice to see a woman empowering herself for a change. How many movies, books and magazines are out there that depict women as victims? A lot! The mistake \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made was broadcasting the advertisement in prime time, when children are awake. They should have broadcast it later in the evening.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I believe that being strong and in condition saved my life not once, but twice. I lived in Pleasanton in the early '90s, and was attacked on two different occasions in broad daylight. Both times the saving grace was my ability to fight off my attacker, and then outrun him. The unfortunate truth is that there are sick people in the world, and those people take advantage of the weak, and victimize them.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  created a strong woman who fended off her attacker. She refused to be a victim, and she won. I found myself at first very upset by the ad, but as it went along I was cheering that the runner got away. I explained the ad to my children, as any parent should have done. Even my children understood the concept "Why run? It could save your life."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Becoming a victim can happen to anyone no matter where you live. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sent a very strong message in that commercial, and I hope it empowers more women and children to fight back.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Broken heart
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Dismayed" doesn't describe this horsewoman's feelings. "Heart-broken" does.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Your article "Horsemen Dismayed Over Demolished Arena" (San Ramon Valley Times, September 28) missed a key point. While the site of the former Double D arena is currently the battleground between the Danville Junior Horsemen and the Humphrey family over who has ownership rights, the demolition of the arena is not just about court documents and dueling attorneys as your article described. At least, not to this horsewoman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before it was reduced to a pile of dirt, the arena was a small sanctuary for generations of adolescent horse lovers, including me. While I attended Los Cerros and later Monte Vista, the arena was where I learned those lessons I never learned in school discipline, sportsmanship and leadership.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was more than a place to ride. It was about membership in the Danville Junior Horsemen organization, where kids and adults met regularly and planned events through group leadership. It was at that arena and in this club setting that I found true friendship and confidence, at an age when I needed it the most.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am dismayed that the current dispute continues. But, when I drove past that freshly bulldozed patch of land on Stone Valley and remembered all the rewarding experiences my fellow horsemen and I shared there, it just broke my heart.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Willy Reid's letter regarding the dangers of the drug Ecstasy he asks for, "Drug Enforcement Agencies and other law enforcement agencies as well as the American Medical Association to just come out and tell the public exactly what the popular drug Ecstasy really is."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Wednesday from 7-9 p.m. at Charlotte Wood Middle School in Danville, several of our local agencies will do just that. A student whose life has been touched by the drug will be part of this powerful presentation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Ecstasy presentation is one of several workshops which are part of the 2000-01 parent education series.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The series is sponsored by the Del Valle Council of PTAs, Communities Against Substance Abuse (CASA) and the San Ramon Valley Unified School District's Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Committee.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The series helps to meet three goals set by the San Ramon Valley Advisory Committee for youth safety and development with regard to parent education:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 *Promote community awareness regarding youth issues;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 *Develop and implement comprehensive, consistent procedures to address prevention and identification of at risk behaviors;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 *Develop family support services to address issues facing youths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The challenge put before parents and community members is to help break the "valley of denial" label given to our community by attending this important presentation.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gore fights for Al
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently, Vice President Gore has promised to "fight for the people." But I think Gore will fight only for Al.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gore's Gulf War vote provides a troublesome example. Legislators from both parties weighed their vote seriously, hesitant to send hundreds of thousands of American children to war.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The night before this monumental debate, however, Gore went to the GOP leader, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, and asked "How much time on the debate floor will you give me if I support the president's decision to go to war?" Democrats opposing the war only offered Gore seven minutes, so Gore bargained for more: "Damn it, if I don't get 20 minutes tomorrow, I'm going to vote the other way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gore attended the vote with alternative speeches, waiting to see who would offer the most speaking time. Gore got it from the pro-war side, and read the pro-war speech.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If Gore puts personal politics over the people's interest on this most important issue, how can we trust him to fight for us on any other issue. He hasn't for the last eight years. I doubt he ever will.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER UNITED will confirm their status as the most marketable football club on the planet on Monday by announcing an alliance with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the American sportswear company, which will bring in the staggering sum of Pounds 300 million over a 15-year period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal, which will come into effect at the start of the 2002-03 season, will earn United Pounds 20 million a season, a figure three times higher than the existing record, which is held by the Brazil national team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Brazil accepted a sum of $ 100 million over a ten-year period, which works out at roughly Pounds 6.7million a year, from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in exchange for the contracts for all their kits at every representative level, including that of the women's team. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  That record is not so much eclipsed as dwarfed by United's latest deal, which, while good news for the club's shareholders, is bad news for Umbro, the Manchester-based company who have made United's kits for the past eight years. Its determination to hold on to the contract was no match for the financial muscle of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Meanwhile, David Beckham, United's midfield player, who has been touted as a future England captain, has denied charges that he spat at Markus Merk, the German referee, during PSV Eindhoven's 3-1 victory on Tuesday evening.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I did not spit at the referee at all. Things happen, you react and get headlines for it, but sometimes it looks worse than it is," Beckham said last night. He did admit, however, that the issue of his temperament remains unresolved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I did have an argument with Gary Neville on the pitch and I shouldn't have," he said, "but it was a frustrating night. A lot of people have opinions about my temperament, but it's part of my game and it's helped me get to where I am."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Beckham aside, the aftermath of United's abject performance in the Philips Stadium was dominated by the extent of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad rotation. "When we saw that Beckham and Giggs were not on the team sheet, we couldn't believe it," Arnold Bruggink, the PSV forward, said. "You can't take Beckham and Giggs out of the team and play the same way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It made us all the more motivated because we thought 'why should Manchester United believe they can beat us with a weak side?' You could see that from the way we played. There's no reason why we can't go to Old Trafford next month, put on the same performance there and get a good result'.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A JOGGER is suing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for GBP 6million after tripping over a shoelace on her trainers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Orthopaedic surgeon Deborah Faryniarz says she suffered serious and permanent injuries to her wrist when she fell while running.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a result she now has to have help while performing operations, including getting others to twist screws into bones. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dr Faryniarz, from New York, said in documents filed in Manhattan District Court that she was wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  GBP 62 a pair Certitude Cross-trainers when her right lace hooked around the back tab of the left shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She was pregnant at the time and fell, hurting her right wrist just days before she was due to begin performing wrist surgeries as part of her hospital residency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'She ended up with her supervising professor also treating her,' said her lawyer, James Kreindler. He added that her child, her first, was born healthy despite the fall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since the injury, he said Dr Faryniarz had managed to continue to perform operations but only with aid from other doctors and nurses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She alleges \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was negligent for carelessly designing, manufacturing, assembling, inspecting, testing and distributing the trainers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Kreindler added that the crux of the lawsuit was that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  knew their product was hazardous, but failed to fix the flaws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The lawsuit alleges that the fall was caused by a leather tab which rises about an inch and a half from the back of the shoe and is used to pull it on to the foot. Mr Kreindler said that on the shoe in question the tab was larger and more rigid than on other designs, making it easier for the shoelace to catch on it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said the style had only been on the market a few months, but he alleges \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had received several complaints about the design and should have made changes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He added: 'Just as important, they should have warned consumers about the defect months before my client was sent sprawling. Because they didn't, Miss Faryniarz has suffered permanent physical disfigurement and disabilities with far reaching effects on all aspects of her personal and professional life as well as great pain, suffering and mental anguish.' The lawyer said: 'She's still trying to be a surgeon but is uncertain what her future will be.' Mr Kreindler described his client as a serious competitive runner in her spare time. He claimed that made it unlikely she would be careless with her footwear when she ran regularly through the streets and parks of Manhattan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Cheryl McCants, a spokesman for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Beaverton, Oregon, said the company was not ready to comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the world's leading maker of athletic shoes with revenues of more than GBP 5billion last year and profits of GBP 330million.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Parents who try and get their kids to watch less sports on TV might have noticed their task has become easier lately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Do not, however, claim victory, because the alternative can be like being forced to watch Marty McSorley's woodchopping act every time it's been replayed this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We're talking about a series of ads run by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , shoe giant and kings of in-your-face messaging, that encourage viewers to make the ground-breaking switch away from the tube and head for the Internet at whatever.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .com.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The TV ads start with three scenarios, including one in which the viewer is made to think a giant snowball is about to roll on them. That's tame compared to the endings, where you get to pick your fate. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flip to the Web site and you can turn yourself into an insect and be squashed by U.S. Olympian Marion Jones, get thrown overboard off a cruise ship by Mark McGwire, be hacked up by a flying chainsaw or have Terrell Davis either throw switchblades at you or hit golf balls off your nose.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charming, indeed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you're not totally grossed out at this point, you can click on an icon to buy their latest shoe. The shock spots note you can use \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products to run, play basketball, get trampled ... whatever.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If this is the type of stuff that made you swear off TV years ago, it's just found another home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was an Internet feeding frenzy three or four years ago, but advertisers weren't promoting their Web sites. Now advertisers are seeing how they can direct traffic into their own hands," said longtime Vancouver media analyst David Stanger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is TV sports in trouble if high-profile advertisers are switching to the Internet?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Just the opposite," said Stanger. "TV people are rubbing their hands with glee knowing they can show advertisers how powerful they can be directing consumers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Taking people away from television was not our primary goal," said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Canada advertising manager Josie Seguin. "It just happened that way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's great cross-branding, of course, and nobody does it better than the company that made paranormal athletes out of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, et al.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It all would be pretty laughable, which is the reaction \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wanted in the first place, unless you consider it wasn't that long ago that the company considered forming its own TV network.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The wave of sports TV on the Internet is about to crest and companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may simply be further ahead than many are willing to admit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What's news on the airwaves:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GLOBAL DOMINANCE? It wasn't a day after the proposed purchase of BCTV by Global when talk of a possible switch of Sports Page to WIC's current Burnaby compound began making the rounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most likely suitors for CKVU is CHUM Ltd., which operates CITY in Toronto, and Craig Broadcasting's A-Channel of Edmonton, neither of which have a particularly strong sports presence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "To say we're not concerned about it would be a lie, but there hasn't been a lot of talk about it," said Sports Pager Barry Macdonald.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keeping a proven Sports Page would make sense. So would moving BCTV's late news to 11 p.m. But not every Sports Page host has a contract that lasts past the planned switchover next fall. Said a hopeful Squire Barnes at BCTV: "It'd be great if they popped more money into sports."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 30-SECOND CLIPS: CTV Sportsnet programming vice-president Scott Moore was up at 4 a.m. Toronto time Tuesday e-mailing congratulations to staffers for two solid reporting jobs. The upstarts first broke Web site stories on the possibility of CFL U.S. expansion plans. CTVSN also had a big jump on Marty McSorley-Donald Brashear, with footage by VTV's Jason Lee from the guilty party, but were pounded by TSN on the suspension announcement. ... The NFL Today got better Thursday when CBS hired Mike Ditka. "I don't want to be over-analytical and I don't want to be boring," said Ditka, who is neither. What of fellow ex-coach Jerry Glanville? Said CBS Sports president Sean McManus: "Jerry will have his seat, seeing as he took it with him off the stage last season."... Hockey Day in Canada was an unqualified success Saturday: One suggestion: Why not let Don Cherry take phone calls from viewers more often?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FIVE WORTH WATCHING
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best in TV this week:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HOCKEY: Canucks-Kings, today, 7 p.m., VTV. Like Don Cherry said, where was this team the last two months?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CURLING: Canadian women's final, Sunday, 10:30 a.m., CBC. Sandra Schmirler's illness has forced two networks to change plans. TSN's Dave Hodge was to interview the cancer-stricken curler on his special (Saturday, 7 p.m.) With Newsworld weather person Colleen Jones free this weekend, don't be surprised if she stands in for Schmirler as an analyst Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GOLF: World Match Play final, Sunday, 11 a.m., TSN, KOMO. Already, this year's final will be better than Andrew Magee-Jeff Maggert.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOCCER: Gold Cup final, Sunday, CTVSN. This one comes with options, depending on Canada's late Thursday game. If Canada's in the final, Sportsnet will go live at noon. A loss and it's on tape at 7 p.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BASKETBALL: Grizzlies-Lakers, Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., CTVSN. "Is there a better two-guard in the NBA now than Michael Dickerson?" asks Sportsnet's Tom Glasgow. If so, he gets a good test tonight against Kobe Bryant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SHORT STUFF
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TIP SHEET: Sportsnet had good, behind-the-scenes Grizzlies footage this week, although with the access they get holding broadcast rights granted by Orca Bay, it's a wonder they didn't do it a lot earlier. Equally revealing was a piece with Michael Heisley outlining his first moves when he becomes owner. ... Sports Journal's piece on abused ex-Blue Jays outfielder Rob Butler on CBC was a revealing look at the secret he held for 15 years. ... CBC's Bruce Baker had a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 good local piece on the B.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hockey College. ... CTVSN drew
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 203,000 viewers for Canucks-Bruins Monday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 QUOTE RACK
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Memorable lines from the week:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - John Shorthouse on CKNW, with the first words on Marty McSorley, and the most definitive: "That is the worst thing I've ever seen."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - Don Taylor of Sports Page, same topic, first to raise an ugly possibility through good tape-editing work: "That looks like a spitting motion (at Donald Brashear) to me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - Perry Solkowski of VTV on a Canucks-Bruins setup, giving Dan Murphy a ribbing but forgetting his female viewers: "The problem with the Bruins, Dan, is something you don't relate to ... they have problems scoring."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not all that glitters is gold, but in the case of Michael Johnson's track shoes, 3M Co. made certain they were.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Johnson, the American sprinter who won the 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Sydney, accomplished the feat in shoes made of 24-carat gold. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Johnson wore gold-colored shoes four years ago at the games Atlanta, but his cobblers at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  called 3M afterward to see if it could make a material that looks more like real gold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 3M, a large producer of reflective material for shoes and clothing, said it thought it could make the material literally from gold if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  didn't mind the material also being reflective. After all, a bit of promotion in front of a world-wide audience doesn't hurt. 3M's personal safety products are part of a unit that generated $3.23 billion in sales last year, 21 percent of the Maplewood-based company's $15.66 billion total.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was delighted, said Claud Lacey, director of 3M Personal Safety Products, so a bunch of scientists in a company lab in St. Paul ordered one small bar of gold and went to work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The eventual result was 45 pairs of gold shoes - 20 for Johnson, 24 for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  promotional purposes, and one pair - signed by Johnson - for 3M.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We'll take them around to trade shows to demonstrate the need for reflective gear for outdoor visibility," Lacey said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In case you were wondering, the answer is no. The gold shoes didn't weigh Johnson down. 3M made the material with a "vapor coating" of 24 carat gold, "so it doesn't add substantially to the weight," Lacey said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's measured in microns."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertisement describing disabled people as drooling, misshapen husks roaming the earth in motorised wheelchairs has sparked international outrage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The clothing giant, which outfitted Australia's Paralympic team, apologised for the advertisement, which appeared in several US outdoor magazines available in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The advertisement says: "You're probably asking yourself, 'How can a trail running shoe ... help me avoid compressing my spinal cord into a Slinky on the side of some unsuspecting conifer, thereby rendering me a drooling, misshapen ... husk of my former self, forced to roam the earth in a motorised wheelchair with my name embossed on one of those cute little licence plates you get at carnivals?'." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Australian disability groups yesterday labelled the advertisement vicious and joined US counterparts in demanding compensation -- a donation for spinal injury research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We offer a sincere apology," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said in a statement issued after its website was bombarded with complaints from around the world. "Clearly, disabilities of any form are no laughing matter and that paragraph should not have been included in the ad. We are immediately pulling this offensive ad from future publication."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company's statement mentioned it outfitted the 2000 Australian Paralympic team and former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  president Bob Woodell uses a wheelchair after injuring his spinal cord.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman for the Australian Paralympic team last night said officials had not seen the advertisement and were unwilling to comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Physical Disability Council of NSW president John Moxon said yesterday the advertisement denigrated accident victims who used wheelchairs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "People with spinal-cord injuries don't end up dribbling. They don't end up silly," said Mr Moxon, who is in a wheelchair as the result of a car-racing accident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We've got a big sense of humour and tend to laugh at ourselves a lot, but that ad was not funny. It was just vicious."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Marcie Roth, director of advocacy and public policy at the US National Council of Independent Living, has demanded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make a sizeable donation to the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MAMBO is negotiating with footware giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to form a distribution alliance in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The anti-establishment leisurewear icon, bought out by Gazal Corp last March, has held talks with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executives visiting Sydney for the Games, The Daily Telegraph has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gazal boss Michael Gazal yesterday said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alliance was being considered as a means to break into the tough US retail market. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We had one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys ring up and ask about it," he said. "It was one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guys out here for the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  " He visited one of the stores."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal ruled out any sale of Gazal's marketing rights to Mambo in the US. Instead, the two are pursuing a joint venture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They could be a good distribution partner," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would have to be one of the giant trademarks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Obviously, getting into bed with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we will have to weigh up all the issues carefully."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Mr Gazal said he was also considering establishing Mambo in America using internal resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Down the track, we may decide we may want to have our own business in the US. We might send someone from Australia to live there and do it ourselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Another option is a joint venture with someone like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but there are a number of different ways we could do it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal is compiling a masterplan to develop a global distribution for Mambo, beginning in the UK and Europe before taking on the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And a stock exchange listing may be in the pipeline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "A float is possible," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Depending on what shape the business takes over the next couple of years and what sort of funding is required to be able to achieve the sort of growth that the brand needs, we could float.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Nothing is imminent, it's probably three to five years away."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Gazal said the Mambo purchase in March had transformed Gazal from a brand renter to a global brand owner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a lot different from being an Australian licensee," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are really focusing on the Australian operation, the European operation and getting our international sourcing structure ready to supply world markets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's an exciting time for us. We just have to make sure we have the right business plan and execute it properly."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Gazal paid Mambo creator Dare Jennings and his partner Andrew Rich $8.7 million worth of Gazal shares, making them the largest shareholders outside the Gazal family with an 8 per cent stake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Jennings remains Mambo's creative director and has joined the Gazal board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How they compare
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * Mambo -- with its flatulent dog imagery -- has global sales of $55 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had US revenues of $A8.61 billion in 1999-2000 against $8.65 billion and $US10.37 billion in the previous two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  revenue breakdown for the latest year was: $6.09 billion (footwear), $2.09 billion (apparel) and $407 million (equipment).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the global sportswear giant, is to create a new unit specifically designed for the women's market. Its move comes as companies finally start to realise that female consumers are interested in a great deal more than make-up and cleaning products.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The new division will be spearheaded by Clare Hamill, appointed vice president of women's business by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman and chief executive Philip H Knight. Mr Knight this week praised Ms Hamill: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  women's business is one of our major growth accelerators in the US, and ... such a critical initiative requires a strong and visionary leader, which is exactly what we have in Clare." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  currently sells only 20 per cent of its $ 7.5bn annual turnover to women. However, it is the leading sportswear brand for women and has seen an opportunity to capitalise on the rapidly increasing interest in women's sports and fitness in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The success of the American women's national soccer team, which won the World Cup in 1999 and the Olympic title at Atlanta in 1996, and then the introduction of the Women's National Basketball League, has attracted huge media coverage across the pond. Increasing interest in women's sport, prompted by these achievements, has sparked a surge in demand for women's sports clothing and footwear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, the products will not only be designed for "active" sportswomen. Corby Casler, communications director at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Oregon, revealed that its women's products aim to "expand beyond the 'core athletics' and reach active women who do not necessarily consider themselves an 'athlete'."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She added: "The business model we will follow is to build upon the way women think. They want to be fit in a way that fits their lifestyle, and that may mean comfortable, performance clothes all day long."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This approach will be mirrored in the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  plans to promote these products. Certainly, it will use its selection of top athletes such as Marion Jones, the popular US sprinter, to gain the required attention, though it hopes to shed a slightly different light upon them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "You will be seeing us signing on more high profile women athletes and expanding the visibility of our current athletes," explained Ms Casler. "Our marketing will help consumers better understand these athletes as people who have lives beyond the professions in which they compete."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soccer duo, Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain, are sure to be at the forefront of this campaign. Ms Hamm was the star of the national side, leading it to victory in the women's world cup in 1999. However, she was eclipsed in the end by Ms Chastain who scored the penalty to seal the win and hit the headlines by tearing off her shirt in the victory celebrations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has historically benefited from close links with top sporting figures, such as Michael Jordan, Ronaldo and Michael Johnson. However, it has recently run into trouble with its deal to sponsor golf sensation Tiger Woods. After persuading Mr Woods to swap his Titelist golf balls for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  it was discovered that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls he used were not the ones on sale to the general public.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite all the huffing and puffing, the vain side of us wants to look
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 great while sweating it out. We usually don't want to wear the same old

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I REFER to your report (ST, June 20) on a seminar held for PSC scholars, where Mr Lim Swee Say, Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology, delivered an address.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Firstly, we thank Mr Lim for acknowledging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a company driven by "value-creation", with strong marketing, design and cutting-edge technology. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, we feel we must clarify the mistaken perception that "a pair of shoes selling for US$ 120 ... costs only US$ 2.20 to make". This is not an accurate reflection of the cost.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A pair of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  footwear is made up of many components. Typically, each shoe is made of up of 34 individual parts, for which the right materials are sourced globally prior to production.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These individual product-component costs certainly have to be factored into the cost of production, as does the investment in machinery and general set-up of the premises where final assembly is conducted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As highlighted by Mr Lim, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does expend great effort and resources in research, testing and design to ensure innovative products and up-to-date designs for our products, and these elements should be reflected in the "cost" of producing a shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the details of product costing remain confidential in every company, including ours, we feel that we have to take the opportunity to make this simple clarification, particularly as the message was addressed to "scholars" who, presumably, will have a strong influence in shaping the future of the nation, and as the article was meant for the public.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tiger Woods, winner of the last three major championships and four of the last five, has signed the richest endorsement contract in the history of sport-for Dollars 100m (pounds 70m).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  That is what it has cost \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to retain his services to September 2006, and yesterday the president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, Bob Wood, said: "We are really, really happy. We have a comprehensive agreement that covers Tiger from head to toe, plus using our golf ball." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract is said by the American magazine Golfweek to be "far beyond anything Michael Jordan received". Quoting a scource close to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it went on: "This is absolutely the richest-ever sporting endorsement. Nothing has ever been close."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Not that it unduly impresses Earl Woods, Tiger's father. When his son turned professional in August 1996 the golfing world gasped when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  paid Dollars 40m for his signature. But Earl, with an eye to the future, described that sum as being only "chump change" and yesterday he was similarly guarded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The next contract," he said, "in 2006 will make that 100 million look like a bargain. There's no doubt that Tiger is going to get better, he's far from having reached his potential. This deal reflects the growing stature of Tiger in world sports, and that is just going to continue to grow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods has already won nine tournaments on the US Tour this year, the first to reach that mark since Sam Snead won 11 in 1950, and at St Andrews this year he became the youngest man ever to win a career grand slam when he won the Open by eight shots.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Prior to that he had won the 2000 US Open by 15 shots, and his first major championship, the US Masters in 1997, was won by 12 shots. Only in the US PGA of 1999, when he was chased to the line by Sergio Garcia before winning by one shot, was the slam in any danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He has ruled world golf in the past two years and, as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has discovered, such brilliance has its price. There is even scope for extending that contract because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as of now, does not make golf clubs, so that aspect of Woods's career is not covered by the current agreement. But when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does start making clubs, as is anticipated, it will doubtless cost the company yet more millions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The scale of the new contract is bad news for the television companies in America, who will shortly have to renegotiate their contract to cover the US Tour. The Tour organisers will be sure to capitalise on the fact that ratings soar whenever Tiger is anywhere near contention and will demand yet another huge increase, so enabling prize funds to go up yet again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  That in turn could be bad news for the European Tour, which is already losing many of its best players to America, after the last round of TV talks produced purses of pounds 3m-pounds 5m for many events in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If that figure were to rise substantially yet again then even such players as Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and Colin Montgomerie might be tempted to play more in the States, diminishing the attraction of European events.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EDMONTON -- A runner's speedo-meter invented by a University of Alberta engineering professor has been snapped up by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as one of five new high-tech devices for the ''digital athlete,'' the sports marketing giant unveiled yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The device, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will sell with a version of its popular Triax wristwatch for $199 U.S. starting in October in the United States and soon after that in Canada, consists of sensors and a microprocessor designed to clip onto shoe laces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a sophisticated wireless gadget that measures stride length and velocity and transmits the information to the watch, which gives constant speed and distance readouts. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken Fyfe, who teaches mechanical engineering at the U of A, came up with the idea a few years ago while talking with his wife, Anne Galloway, about ideas for a design project to give his students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A veteran marathon runner, she suggested something to help runners improve their training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Fyfe, also a runner and coach of the Leduc Track club, decided he'd work on it himself rather than giving it to his students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He later formed a company called Dynastream Innovations Inc. with his younger brother Kip, an electrical engineer in Cochrane, Alta., to further develop prototypes and shop it around to sports equipment manufacturers, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Fyfe said his invention, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is labelling the SDM (Speed Distance Monitor) Triax 100, is a big improvement over the typical pedometer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A pedometer is a stride counter that counts the number of steps you take and then uses what you think is your average stride length to tell you how far you've gone, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''This thing is actually measuring each and every stride. So even if you change your stride length, this calculates that.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's more than 97 per cent accurate and can also be used to store data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clare Hammil, vice- president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Equipment, said at a news conference at company headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, that of the five devices the company touted yesterday, it was most excited about the speed and distance watch. ''The simple question when you go out for a run, go for a walk, you're out hiking, is how far did I go and how fast did I move?''
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  created a new division it is calling \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Techlab to market the speed-distance monitor and four other new products for what it's calling the dotcom or digital athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its other products include a new heart monitor, a portable digital audio player, a backcountry wristwatch that will give out altitude, compass and weather readings and a new two-way radio for snowboarders, hikers and the like.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ray Riley, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Equipment creative director, called the speed- distance watch a simple out-of-the-box solution for today's athletes who are hungry for information about their workout. ''You take it out, you put the little pod on your foot, you put your watch on, you push a button and you go and you find out what you need.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state Supreme Court yesterday agreed to decide whether athletic shoe and apparel giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Inc. can be held liable for alleged misrepresentations of its labor practices in the Asian countries where its products are made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A San Francisco Superior Court judge and a First District Court of Appeal panel had rejected a private attorney-general suit brought under the unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code Sec. 17200.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lower courts rejected Marc Kasky's suit on First Amendment grounds. They said the company's effort to persuade consumers that it was acting responsibly on the issue shouldn't be judged by the same rules that govern advertisements generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Chief Justice Ronald George and Justices Stanley Mosk, Joyce L. Kennard, Kathryn M. Werdegar, and Janice Rogers Brown voted to grant review, a court official said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oregon-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products are largely manufactured by South Korean and Taiwanese firms at factories in those countries and in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Those companies reportedly employ between 300,000 and 500,000 employees to manufacture the shoes and other athletic gear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -hired consulting firm reported favorable working conditions at the factories, other investigators reported poor health conditions, 11- to 12-hour work days, compulsory overtime, violation of minimum wage laws, exposure to dangerous levels of dust and toxic fumes, and employment of workers under the age of 16.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A series of newspaper and television reports in 1996 and 1997 put additional pressure on the company for its overseas labor record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fought back with a costly public relations campaign that characterized the company as a leader in the fight to improve working conditions in the hot countries. Press releases detailed answers to the allegations, as did a series of letters to collegiate athletic directors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kasky sued over those releases and letters, alleging that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misrepresented the facts when it asserted that workers are not subjected to corporal punishment or sexual abuse, that the laws and regulations on wages, hours, health and safety were observed, that pay averaged double the minimum wage in Southeast Asia, and that employees receive free meals and health care and a "living wage."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kasky's action was dismissed on demurrer, and the First District's Div. One affirmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Justice Donald Swager said the statements at issue for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were intended to promote a favorable corporate image and demand a different analysis than that applying to product advertisements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The press releases and letters at issue here cross the boundary between political and private decisionmaking," the justice said. "The citizen may want to translate personal discontent over \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labor practices into political action or may merely wish to refrain from purchasing its products manufactured by undesired labor practices, just as he or she may wish to buy products with a union identification."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The analysis isn't changed by the fact that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an economic motivation in defending its corporate image from criticism, he said. The communications were still part of a "public dialogue on a matter of public concern within the core area of expression protected by the First Amendment," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  KATHARINE MERRY modelled the revolutionary running kit created by her sponsors yesterday on her first day as Britain's women's captain. But she will never be allowed to wear it in her country's cause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merry's rise to the forefront of British athletics was formally acknowledged when the 400metres runner succeeded the injured Paula Radcliffe as captain of the women's team for this weekend's European Cup in Gateshead. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But she cannot match her new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  outfit with her new role for Britain because the American sportswear company is not the official supplier to the national squad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merry, though, is looking forward to her new responsibilities, not that she needs an introduction to them.The 25-year-old, who first made the team 12 years ago as one of Britain's youngest ever internationals, said: 'I don't think it entails much more than I have always done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I've always kept an eye out for the younger girls in the team and been there if they need advice.' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stole a march on German rivals, adidas, when Merry showed off its new head-to-toe racing suit for the cameras.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But adidas will be the official supplier to Britain's athletes for the Olympics in Sydney in September, although it doesn't launch its new kit until today when heptathlete Denise Lewis performs the modelling honours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Reebok, meanwhile, will clothe the British team for the European Cup.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merry has a personal contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which insists she wears its kit whenever national uniform is not obligatory. But the sportswear giant will not demand she wears the Swift Suit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merry, however, is keen to give it a whirl. She may premiere her outfit with its hood and gloved hands when she races world champion Cathy Freeman at Crystal Palace on August 2.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Another Midlander, Bob Weir, has waited even longer than Merry to be men's captain as successor to injured high jumper Dalton Grant.When Weir, 39, was first on the team 18 years ago, UKA's chief executive David Moorcroft had still not set his world 5000m record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Britain's line-up for the European Cup was changed for the ninth time yesterday when European javelin champion Steve Backley was replaced by silver medallist Mick Hill after citing 'technical problems' with his throwing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  BEN JOHNSON sprinted again in Rome yesterday where he ran a world 100m record in 1987.This time his opponent was a woman pickpocket, and he lost. At stake this time for the Canadian stripped of an Olympic gold medal after a positive drug test was not a medal but his own wallet containing GBP 3,150.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Johnson, who is banned for life from athletics after two positive tests for steroids, was robbed by gypsies who distracted him as he walked to a bank on Rome's elegant Via Veneto.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chairman of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Phil Knight, will not make a planned $30 million contribution to help his alma mater, the University of Oregon, renovate its athletic stadium because the university joined a factory monitoring group other than the one he supports, a senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Knight, a billionaire who heads the world's largest footwear company, has given about $30 million to the university over the last decade, but company officials said he was disturbed that the university joined the Workers Rights Consortium, a student-backed monitoring group. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which has faced criticism over working conditions in its overseas factories, has often faulted the consortium for being unfriendly to apparel and footwear manufacturers. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an enthusiastic member of another monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association, a White House-backed organization that, unlike the Workers Rights Consortium, has apparel companies on its board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said: "The University of Oregon, despite its unique relationship with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Phil, is free to align itself with the Workers Rights Consortium. However, it does not mean that we are required to support those efforts with which we have fundamental disagreements."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The University of Oregon, based in Eugene, has been developing plans to renovate and expand Autzen Stadium, a project that is expected to cost $80 million. University officials said they still hoped to talk with Mr. Knight to see whether he might reconsider his decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Randy Newnham, a university senior and a coordinator of the Survival Center, which supports social justice and human rights, criticized Mr. Knight's decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's kind of amusing, considering that he's upset that we joined some labor-monitoring body," Mr. Newnham said. "He keeps claiming that his company is socially responsible and they don't use sweatshop labor. If that's the case, why is he so upset that we joined this monitoring group? It kind of implies that something isn't quite up to par."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the last six months, student groups at dozens of campuses have held sit-ins and demonstrations to pressure their universities to join the Workers Rights Consortium, instead of the Fair Labor Association. The consortium, set up by students with the backing of several labor unions, now has 45 universities as members. It monitors overseas factories that make hats, T-shirts and other apparel that are made under license and carry a university's logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The students assert that the Fair Labor Association is dominated by corporations and will not be vigorous in its monitoring. Its members include several consumer groups, human rights groups and 130 colleges.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials criticize the consortium's makeup and its requirement for surprise monitoring visits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We object to the Workers Rights Consortium because it does not provide a seat on the table for companies," said Vada Manager, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman. "Another issue is it has a 'gotcha' monitoring system, which in our minds is not a serious way to achieve the common goal that we all want to achieve, which is to eradicate sweatshop conditions."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To pressure \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  United Students Against Sweatshops, the umbrella group backing the consortium, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and other groups issued a report yesterday that criticized \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for using sweatshops. The report faults \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for doing much of its production in China, where independent unions are prohibited and where, the report said, workers are paid at most $1.50 for a pair of shoes that sells for $100.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials assert that the company has made great strides in improving its factories, that they do more monitoring than most companies and that their factories usually pay more than other factories in the regions where they are situated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last month, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it was ending its agreement to supply Brown University's hockey teams after Brown joined the consortium. Brown officials said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  move resulted from miscommunication.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nicholas Reville, a Brown junior active in United Students Against Sweatshops, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Mr. Knight moved against Brown and the University of Oregon, to warn other universities against join the Workers Rights Consortium.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  TEENAGERS are set to jump on the latest craze - high-tech bouncing shoes dubbed "trampoline trainers".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are releasing the pounds 100 a pair shoes, named Shox, with a huge advertising campaign simply called Boing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite their high cost industry experts think they will soon become a cult fashion accessory for youngsters around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, said: "The 14-year-old trainer connoisseurs will think it's cool and new - and that's where this is aimed." Scientists have spent 16 years perfecting the trainers, which use special foam - the same as that used in the nose cones of Formula 1 racing cars - in the heel to produce the bounce effect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There are three types for running, basketball and training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They will go on sale in Britain this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But top American sports stars including Olympic gold medallists Maurice Greene and Marion Jones and basketball star Vince Carter, are already wearing the shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mario Lafortune, director of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sports research laboratory, led the team which has been testing them since 1984.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said that four columns of high density foam in the heels act "just like the suspension system of a car - they are the suspension system for the athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They make the difference between landing on concrete and landing on a small trampoline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They the most tested piece of footwear technology ever to come out of our lab."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And Juliet Moran, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vice-president, added: "With \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox we set out to really push the envelope of athletic footwear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shox delivers on what people expect from us - a unique combination of innovation and performance with a little bit of magic."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Following hot on the high-tech heels of the adidas neck-to-ankle compression suit, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has unveiled its rival "swift suit" for sprinters at the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cathy Freeman and fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -backed athletes Marion Jones, Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson have tested the full-body version which has been two years in the design and making.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teams from Australia, the United States, Kenya and other countries contracted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the Olympics will be offered the suits to test and wear at the Games, subject to approval. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Athletes testing the adidas suit include Commonwealth 100m champion Ato Boldon, Olympic champion Donovan Bailey and Matt Shirvington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like the adidas model, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit is designed to protect muscles and facilitate movement. It differs from adidas in that it is hooded, has mesh ear holes, half-gloves and stirrups, and is made from five different fabrics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marion Jones, the world's fastest woman, will line up in the suit for the first time in the 100m at the Prefontaine Classic grand prix meeting in Eugene, Oregon, this weekend.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 100m world champion has already tested it in training and declared it "awesome".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When you get into the suit and it's so sleek and smooth, it seems like you are going to cut through the wind, through the air," Jones said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I am ready to run fast period. I am probably going to do that whatever. It's going to be interesting to see this weekend ... how much faster I am going to run. But it's about performance, that's what it comes down to."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -backed Australian sprinter Damien Marsh agreed, saying that training and performance made the athlete, not clothing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marsh said he was wearing distance-running spikes to relieve pressure on a sore Achilles when he lined up and won the 1995 grand prix final in Monte Carlo in 10.13s. He spent the next two years out of the sport after rupturing his Achilles but is now back training for the Olympics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "To me it doesn't matter what you wear. Because of the rigid spike plates you get on shoes these days you'll get a lot of guys getting Achilles problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can see the sense with these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suits being tight-fitting but it gives you a false sense of security. What happens when it starts to stretch and doesn't hold you in the same way? The only way is to do it yourself, get out there and do the sit-ups to get strength through the abdominals and back work to keep your shoulders strong.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At the end of the day Carl Lewis didn't need a suit to run fast. It's not for me, either."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -backed Australian Commonwealth long-jump champion Peter Burge was circumspect about the prototype suit he has seen but not worn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The one I saw was all-white, so it looked a bit suss, it would look good on Oxford Street but when they put some colour to it, it should be fine," Burge said. "I've been told there's a good chance we'll have it for the Olympics which would be pretty cool. I would only wear it in warm-up if it was cold to keep warm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It would stop getting sand in your shorts but I wear tights so I've got that problem sorted. I get sand in my shoes but I am too superstitious to take my shoes off in between jumps. I like everything to feel the same the whole competition. I just try and shake it out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't think a suit is going to make me jump further, either. I don't want to attract people because of the way I look. I want to attract people because of how far I jump. That is the issue."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tucked away in a office on Baltimore's South Street is Global Alliance for Workers and Communities, a not-for-profit group with a grand scheme -- to alleviate poor working conditions in overseas factories -- and even bigger partners, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. and Gap Inc., to carry it out.      Global Alliance, an initiative of the International Youth Foundation, was formed in April of last year by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the Gap, The World Bank Group and Pennsylvania State University, among other organizations, to give foreign factory workers a voice about their working conditions through one-on-one interviews, which guide Global Alliance in developing programs that address those concerns.     "The Global Alliance formed as part of an effort to provide workers with an opportunity to develop their potential and fulfill their aspirations," said Kevin F.F. Quigley, executive director of the group. He pointed out that healthy and happy workers help the factories run more smoothly and the corporations that run them turn better profits.     \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said this program is a chance to attack a pervasive issue differently and strategically.     "We felt like we needed to do something completely innovative and to focus on the worker and the factory manager," said Maria Eitel, vice president and senior adviser for corporate responsibility at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "We are opening up the whole process with opinions of workers. This is really a different way of working and will make some really important contributions."    \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has supplied $ 7.7 million and the Gap has pledged $ 5 million during the next five years, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation provided a $ 250,000 grant.      The funds will support the assessments and programs in 12 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and possibly India, Mexico, Bulgaria and Romania. The group expects to spend about $ 14 million over five years.     There are no conflicts of interest, Quigley said, because worker interviews are confidential and the corporations and factory managers cannot attach strings to their participation or in the funding of Global Alliance. Survey participation is voluntary and workers are compensated for their donated time.     Eitel touted the group's "transparency" as it publishes its methods and quarterly findings on its Web-site, www.theglobalalliance.org.     Thus far the group has surveyed about 4,000 workers -- most of whom are young women -- in 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  apparel and shoe factories in Thailand and Vietnam. Operations are underway in 19 of Indonesia's Gap and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  factories, said Quigley. Global Alliance will be working with factory workers in China by early next year, he added.     Most workers in the Thailand and Vietnam factories believe they are paid fairly but want access to health care and training for future job growth opportunities, according to Global Alliance's first annual report. For instance, 47 percent of Thailand's survey participants want to resume basic education. Many workers complained about persistent colds and headaches. Although they receive free annual physicals, they often do not know how to interpret the results, the report said.     Global Alliance is in the midst of organizing health clinics, medical training seminars and health-care education programs on reproductive health in the Thailand and Vietnam factories. Setting up schools and classes for workers during and after work is in progress.     Faced with a daunting challenge, the partnership has trimmed some of its initial goals during the past year. It originally planned to reach 25 countries and to monitor illegal working conditions, but the number of countries has been cut to 12. Global Alliance will only report illegal activities when revealed during the assessment process, the annual report said.     The group's partners have realized they can't fulfill every worker need and will rely more on local nongovernmental organizations to help carry out programs, the report stated. More corporate partners will augment the group's potential through funding and access to other types of factories, Quigley said.     "We are beginning to lay the foundation for a very successful initiative, but this is not easy. It is a complicated environment to work in," he said. "This is just our first step. The next step is to act and to deliver effective and sustainable programs. At that point we could say with much more confidence that we have been successful."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PREMIERSHIP champion Manchester United has struck a world record GBP 300m kit sponsorship deal with US sportswear firm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it was reported today.  The GBP 20m-a-year contract, to run for 15 years, could be confirmed on Monday, when the club announces half-year results.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Manchester United shares climbed 17p - 6.59 per cent - from 257p to 274p in early trading.  The deal, yet to be confirmed by either party, will dwarf the GBP 65m \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  paid for a 10-year deal with the Brazilian FA. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract, which underlines the strength of Manchester United as the leading global sports brand, is set to begin at the start of the 2002-3 season.  While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal is good news for United and its shareholders, it will be a body blow to Manchester sports brand Umbro, which has supplied the famous red shirts for the last eight years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, Martin Prothero, head of marketing at Umbro International, was not giving up hope.  Umbro has a contract with Manchester United until July 2002. We continue to be in negotiations about our ongoing situation.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite the strong links between Umbro and Manchester United - Reds' chief executive Peter Kenyon and group marketing director Peter Draper both used to work in senior roles there - Umbro may ultimately lack the financial muscle to out-bid \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , one of the biggest sportswear companies in the world.  Umbro also supplies the England kit and also has deals with leading clubs Chelsea and Celtic. Mr Prothero was not willing to discuss the possible impact of losing Manchester United, which experts say would be the jewel in the crown'' for any sportswear company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Roy Kaitcer, of Manchester stockbrokers Wise Speke, raised questions about whether United will be able to confirm the deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with so much of the Umbro deal still to run.  United's group marketing director Peter Draper declined to comment on the reports today, stating: I am not in a position to say anything.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SIR ALEX FERGUSON is being head-hunted by sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to become their football ambassador - on a massive contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talks between the Manchester United boss and the American company are at an advanced stage and Ferguson may sign a deal shortly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson has been targeted by the firm as the ideal man to front their push for top football contracts with clubs and players worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He revealed to United shareholders that he is considering one lucrative job offer after being pursued by dozens of top companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I've got a lot of offers already. One of them is really staggering. It would be a four-year contract for a huge amount of money and would involve a lot of travelling."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The salary being discussed is around pounds 1million-a-year on a four-year contract with VIP expenses, and the possibilities of bonuses are endless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may even be willing to offer Ferguson the job on a 'part-time' basis. However, it would too demanding for Ferguson to work at United in a significant capacity as well.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ambush marketing, or parasite marketing as some prefer to call it, is not about ethics but opportunism. And it is a major problem for the IOC because it can devalue an Olympic sponsorship, writes Rochelle Burbury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 hile Ian Thorpe basked in the adulation of winning a Gold medal in the 400 metres swimming last week, one Olympic sponsor was not amused.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As Thorpe stood on the dais, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  logo on his team tracksuit was covered by the Australian flag. Thorpe is, of course, sponsored by non-Olympic sponsor adidas, and there are suggestions that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed adidas had persuaded Thorpe to intentionally cover the competitive logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both adidas and Thorpe deny any deliberate attempt to hide the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  logo, but the incident has echoes of the US Basketball "Dream Team" at the 1992 Games, when several high-earning players refused to wear the Reebok team tracksuit to receive their medals because they were sponsored by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A compromise was reached when the players draped the US flag over the logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I've got about two million good reasons not to wear Reebok," player Charles Barkley said at the time. His \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stablemate Michael Jordan added: "We agreed not to deface the Reebok outfit. The American flag cannot deface anything."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thorpe's manager, David Flaskas from Grand Slam International, says he and Thorpe would not condone such activity, which he describes as "bordering on paranoia".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Ian was there to race, not to worry about his sponsorship obligations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "On the night of the 400m everything was a blur [to Ian] and he was so emotional he was in no state to put a flag over a logo," Flaskas says. "The rivalry between adidas and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has probably got more to do with it than Ian."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before it became a Sydney Olympics sponsor at the 11th hour late last year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been known as one of the most celebrated ambush marketers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Atlanta, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  built an interactive sports centre overlooking the Olympic park and after sprinter Michael Johnson, wearing gold \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes, won a Gold medal, he said: "Just as I'm part of the Olympics, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  part of the Olympics."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Sydney, the now non-sponsor adidas has built an athlete hospitality and international media centre at Sydney's Shore school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has hosted numerous exclusive media events with its sponsored medal-winning athletes, including one with Thorpe at Taronga Zoo's seal pool which saw 150 members of the media attend. "adidas has done a fabulous job," says sponsorship marketing expert Kim Skildum-Reid, who hosted a series of ambush marketing workshops before the Games. "They partner 26 of the 28 sports in the Olympic Games and that's absolutely a 100 per cent true statement and that's what people take away. And everyone knows the two sports they don't [sponsor]. They've almost outNike-ed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 adidas marketing director Rob Mills says adidas equips 3,500 athletes and has every right to promote its association with sport. He denies, however, that adidas put Thorpe up to covering the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  logo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We briefed all our athletes pre-Games. We sat down and said we expected them to comply and wear the [team] uniforms. Frankly, it's ironic that some people are making those assumptions," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We in no way asked out athletes to do that ... We've been on the other side of that as well and we respect that another brand is a sponsor and has certain rights."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mills also defends adidas's marketing program. "We define ambush marketing as when you break laws. We've been very careful right from the start of our planning in '97 that we don't break local laws and our commitments to the International Olympic Committee," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't at all see ourselves as ambush marketers but as sports marketers at the biggest sporting event ... If we come out of research results as an Olympic sponsor we'll be extremely disappointed. We want our brand to strengthen and be seen as a premium sports brand [and] we are confident that we're moving in that direction."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ambush marketing, or parasite marketing as some prefer to call it, is not about ethics, but opportunism. An IOC international study of consumers in 1996 found that 25 per cent thought ambush marketing was clever. Done well, it can muddy the waters of who is an official sponsor. You only have to look at research in June and July by Sweeney Sports, which measures consumer awareness of Olympic sponsors, to see how effective ambushing can be. Among its rankings of most recognised Olympic sponsors, non-sponsors adidas and Qantas ranked seventh and eighth respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ambushing is a major problem for the IOC because it has the potential to devalue an Olympic sponsorship. Ambush marketing is notoriously difficult to police, despite legislation to protect sponsors, and there is no law that states that it is prohibited, according to lawyer Kate Jordan from Clayton Utz.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even though IOC marketing director Michael Payne sees Sydney's Games as the most ambush-free of any Olympics, there has been plenty of borderline activity and several breaches of legislation designed to protect sponsors before the Games began.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before the Games, SOCOG was able to prevent incidences of ambush marketing, including attempts by washing powder manufacturer Omo and National Australia Bank. Mazda was forced to withdraw an ad in July which congratulated its sponsored swimmers Michael Klim and Thorpe for making the Olympic team, and Fairfax narrowly averted pulping its Good Weekend magazine last week after an ad from OzEmail featured pole
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 vaulter Emma George breaching the AOC's guidelines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Non-sponsor Mitsubishi, whose ads use the line "Gold, Silver Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond", has slipped through the loop because its ads are considered to be congratulatory. Non-sponsor Yamaha, which featured on musicians' instruments during the Opening Ceremony, was able to get away with it because instruments were considered equipment by the IOC, as are the giant TV screens and time results with branding by sponsors Panasonic and Swatch in various venues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No company would admit to being an ambush marketeer, preferring to defend their right to promote themselves during the world's biggest sporting event. But there is little doubt that ambushing is alive and well in Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 National Australia Bank tried its luck in 1997, just after Westpac was announced as a sponsor, with its "Team National" advertising featuring 12 athletes. But sponsorship experts branded it as "contrived", particularly because NAB had little history of supporting sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Qantas has been more successful. It began its campaign back in 1997, when it signed up 40 athletes 30 of whom were Olympians to feature in its advertising. Qantas has consistently denied that it is ambush marketing but rather promoting its long association with sport. It was caught out last month, however, after Olympic sponsor Ansett took legal action over two newspaper advertisements one featuring Cathy Freeman and another promoting its "Olympic sale".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The matter was settled out of court and overnight just before the start of the Games all Qantas's advertising featuring athletes was removed and replaced by a new "I still call Australia home" campaign with the children's choir. Its ads now carry the disclaimer "Qantas is not an Olympic sponsor".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ansett accused its rival of being "un-Australian" and at the time, Qantas deputy chief executive officer Geoff Dixon said: "No-one and no legislation I know of says that an 80-year-old company with our reputation cannot market ourselves during this event."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ansett Olympics spokesman Michael Rolnick says his airline has not had any concerns from Qantas during the Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We didn't go to court to say [Qantas] couldn't advertise during the Games. There were two examples in newspapers which indicated to us a trend where it specifically violated the Trade Practices Act and the Olympic Indicia Act. We had a very strong case and had some support from SOCOG and the IOC but we could have had some more," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's something any sponsor would do to defend its position ... the legal action and subsequent settlement left Ansett very pleased with the outcome."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Skildum-Reid says without the legal action, Qantas has mounted an almost perfect ambush.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "What sponsorship is about and when it's really powerful is when it makes an emotional connection with your audience.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They've managed to convey a pride in our athletes and showcasing Australia and a pride in Australia more than any other sponsor has. They're almost ambushing the emotion and that's what makes it so powerful," she says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sponsor Carlton & United Breweries also had cause to take rival Lion Nathan to court after it ran ads stating that its brand Tooheys was the "beer of choice" at Stadium Australia. The matter was settled out of court but CUB is still seeking damages and relief and will head back to court next month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lion Nathan, however, defends its position. "Those ads stopped in August before any of this CUB suggestion we were involved in ambush marketing," spokesman Gabriel McDowell says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Tooheys New is the official beer at Stadium Australia for every event outside Olympic events and we believe it's perfectly legitimate and a natural promotion for us to be involved with. We'll definitely be defending it [in court] because we believe we've done absolutely nothing wrong with that promotion."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tooheys' television commercials, including one where the marathon blue line diverts to a backyard barbeque, has featured in stories on German, French, American and British TV shows. The ads carry a similar disclaimer to Qantas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The ad makes it abundantly clear that we're not a sponsor ... it's entirely appropriate beer is a large part of celebration and we all have a duty to promote ourselves during this period. If it was ambush marketing I'm sure CUB would be on to it. Just because our competitor is a sponsor of the Games doesn't mean that we'll sit back and do nothing. That would be unprofessional."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Olympic venues and live sites so far have been relatively ambush free. SOCOG legal counsel and brand protection manager Catherine McGill and her team of 50 ambush police have found only isolated incidences of breaches, usually by spectators carrying flags partly branded who did not understand the laws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've been very, very lucky ... There's been nothing on an orchestrated level and we're extremely pleased with the result," she says. "The counterfeiting program has been extremely successful as well ... We have found certain infringements but it's much lower than prior to the Games."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Skildum-Reid says ambushers are more sophisticated with their programs today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are starting to realise that old-style ambushing of sneaking your logo into the stadium and holding it up behind a goal post doesn't work anymore ... In the past a lot of ambush was done for ambush's sake because it was there but did it work for their brand? Not really," she says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Now it's bigger and functions very much like a sponsorship without the fee. It's planned and budgeted for for years exactly the way their counterparts, the sponsors, are doing."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods formally signed a new five-year endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday as industry analysts tried to answer the 100-million US question.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is a golfer worth that much money?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Part of that answer rests with what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ultimate goals really are," said Bob Williams of Chicago-based Burns Sports Celebrity Service, which matches athletes with corporate sponsors. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The good news is they found Michael Jordan's replacement as the most marketable athlete in the world, and the best athlete in the world."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The downside, Williams said, is that golf is a niche sport that doesn't reach the masses and doesn't have the television ratings the NBA pulled in during the Jordan era.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "How much growth is there in golf?" Williams said. "And how much can \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  capitalize?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal is worth an estimated $148.6 million Cdn over five years, according to a source close to the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity. It is believed to be the richest endorsement contract in sports, depending on how that is defined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Williams said Jordan made as much as $37 million a year, depending on sales. Former heavyweight champion George Foreman recently sold his likeness to Salton Inc., which makes barbecue grills, for more than $204 million in cash and stocks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But that was a lifetime deal. Woods' new contract expires in 2006 when he will be 30 and just hitting the prime of his career.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The value \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  received on the first contract caused me to come to my conclusion that it would be chump change," his father, Earl Woods, said of the five-year, $59.4 million deal that raised eyebrows in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And this contract will be chump change compared to the next one, because Tiger is only going to get bigger and better."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While not discussing specifics of the contract, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood said money was not the best way to measure Woods' worth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't even look at it like that," he said. "When the first one came out, everyone said, 'What the hell did you do that for?' His representation is enough to reinforce everything we stand for -- competitiveness, excellence and a desire to be better."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Trying to measure Woods' value goes beyond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Agent Mark Steinberg said yesterday he is working on contract extensions with other companies Woods endorses, such as American Express and EA Sports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said "They will compensate Tiger fairly for what he does for each of them."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is in a different league. Woods is a walking swoosh from the top of his hat to the heel of his shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's the most photographed athlete -- and maybe the most photographed entertainer," Steinberg said. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the only brand you can see on this person. That's why it makes it a more all-encompassing endorsement."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cathy Freeman earned more than the Australian cricketer Shane Warne from her main sponsor \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, rather than being naive, was actively involved in her financial affairs, her former accountant Peter Jess claimed yesterday.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first deal was a personal contract worth "multi-millions" as a result of compounding performance bonuses that he said made her Australia's highest-paid sportswoman. The second was a contract co-joined with the Melbourne International Track Club (MITC) which was specifically designed to "double-leverage" her money. Both were signed in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jess said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was totally unaware that the bulk of its four-year $1 million contract with MITC would go to Freeman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman has submitted court documents saying she was only entitled to $5,000 a year and some licensing rights under the MITC \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract, but Jess yesterday alleged that Freeman "received nearly $500,000 in direct benefits from it".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jess and Freeman's former partner Nick Bideau, who are both directors of MITC, are suing the Olympic champion for breach of contract after she ripped up their management contract in May. The case is to be heard in the Victorian Supreme Court today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jess said: "The only people who will win out of this case are the lawyers; it is just a joke. She hasn't done badly, and we have been pilloried for doing a creative job."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bideau said yesterday: "The case is out of my hands, otherwise it would have been sorted out by now". Jess has rejected Freeman's claims to the court that she was "at a special disability" and "naive and inexperienced". He says she attended nearly all of the meetings with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when the deals were being negotiated and that around 12 months ago Freeman and her husband Sandy Bodecker went through her financial dealings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They understood the structure of her finances and approved of it all," Jess said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the MITC was a vehicle for Freeman to recoup sponsorship monies lost just after the Atlanta Olympics, when Kelloggs and Schweppes failed to renew their deals after she won a silver medal. Bideau and Jess had come up with the idea of creating a private club based around Freeman, but attracting others of the ilk of marathon runner Steve Moneghetti.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "MITC mirrored the contract she already had with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and for that we gained an extra $500,000 over the period of the contract without her doing one extra single thing," Jess said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  didn't know how much money was going to Freeman; from their point of view it was a sponsorship deal of 27 athletes, although the bulk of that went to Catherine Freeman."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Assistant Enforcement Unit head Ahmad Sharif said action was taken

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Doug Smith HONOLULU - A Vince Carter-Tiger Woods showdown, perhaps?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter, one of the NBA's most marketable commodities, may be soon joining Woods, arguably the hottest personality in the sports world today, in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  endorsement fold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Internet site Hoopstv.com reported yesterday that Carter, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Puma had agreed to a deal that would settle a dispute with Puma for about $18 million (all figures U.S.) and pay Carter about $12 million over the next six years as another \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  client.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Merle Scott, one of Carter's agents with the firm IMG, told The Star yesterday that no deal had been finalized to allow Carter to finally get fully clear of a contract he had originally signed with Puma three years ago. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter denied the Internet report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There's no deal," he told Associated Press. "Everybody thinks they know everything that's going on with me. I'm tired of it, really," Carter said at the U.S. Olympic basketball team training camp. "I just got out of a Puma suit, so how can I have a deal ready?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Everybody's jumping the gun."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But a source close to Carter did say negotiations are continuing and could wrap up before the end of the week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's my impression (Vince and his agents) still have some work to do with Puma," Ralph Greene, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  global director of basketball, was quoted as saying by the Internet site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Puma and Carter are trying to settle a contentious $13.5 million arbitration award the footwear and clothing company won after Carter breached his original deal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter's original agent, the currently indicted Tank Black, got his client a 10-year, $25 million deal with Puma. Carter tried to walk away from the deal in the middle of last season, saying the Puma shoes he was wearing were ill- fitting and uncomfortable, but the company won the $13.5 million judgment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's unclear exactly how much Puma will get immediately in any deal Carter reaches with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how much might be in future cash considerations. Carter's agents and lawyers have been negotiating with Puma and other footwear-clothing companies since the arbitrator awarded the company the startling sum last month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although the value of shoe and clothing deals in the NBA are closely guarded secrets, people with knowledge of the contracts say the Carter deal would be one of the most lucrative in the league if it approaches the $2 million a year value.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It will also allow Carter to finally wear clothing and shoes that bear a logo.  Under terms of the binding arbitration decision, Carter had been unable to wear the logos of any company that competes with Puma.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Meanwhile, the rift that's apparently developed between Carter and his one- time teammate Tracy McGrady has caught Carter by surprise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Disrespected by members of McGrady's family and entourage and the subject of some thinly veiled jealousy from his former teammate, Carter now thinks he might have read the situation between him and his cousin wrong all along.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "That's the only surprising thing," Carter said of a magazine story that made it apparent he and McGrady might not have been as close as Carter thought.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I felt we were (close) and I read that we weren't.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I guess that's my fault. I read too deep into the relationship."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter refuses to get into a war of words with McGrady, who bolted for the Orlando Magic.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods signed a five-year endorsement contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday that is believed to be worth $85 million, making it the richest endorsement deal in sports history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The exact worth of the contract is hard to estimate because some of the value is tied to sales and incentives. But having already won three major championships and nine tournaments this year, Woods has continued his incredible 2000 run with an unprecedented endorsement deal that will continue his strong relationship with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Woods has his own \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  line of clothing and shoes, he switched to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball in May, and he appears regularly in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercials. Woods's current five-year, $40 million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expires in September 2001. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The new deal, which runs through September 2006, will begin when his current deal expires.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bob Wood, the president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, refused to reveal specifics of the deal, but he was elated that an agreement had been reached.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The final details were worked out about 90 minutes ago," Wood said last night from his office in Beaverton, Ore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've been negotiating for about 18 months, but I.M.G., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Tiger have all been in the same ballpark for awhile now," Wood continued. "A lot of people thought we overpaid for Tiger in his original deal, but we don't feel we overpaid for him then, and we don't feel we overpaid for him now. We think it's a fair deal for everybody. He's had a huge impact on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf, and we think that will continue for the next 25 years or more.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A lot of people have compared Tiger to Michael Jordan, but one thing that makes them different is that the career of a professional golfer is so much longer than the career of a basketball player. The earning power of a professional golfer is far greater over the course of a lifetime. We're looking forward to extending our relationship with Tiger for the duration of his career, which will extend for the next 20 to 25 years and beyond."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At 24, Woods has won all four major championships, becoming the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, and he holds the career scoring record in all majors in relation to par. Television ratings for tournaments increased dramatically when Woods plays, and his galleries are by far the largest on tour, attracting record-setting crowds to tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods signed a five-year $30 million endorsement deal with Buick worth $30 million earlier this year, and he has endorsement contracts with several other companies. Obviously, Woods is financially secure for several lifetimes, but his father, Earl Woods, said that no business deals would diminish Woods's intensity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For Tiger, it has never been about the money," Earl Woods said yesterday from his home in Cypress, Calif. "I have a kid who is basically self-motivated, and for that, I thank the Lord. He doesn't need someone waving dollar signs in front of his face to get him going. His performance isn't going to drop off just because he signs a deal, or earns a certain amount of money. Tiger has no comfort zone when it comes to competition. People don't believe me, but he's going to get much better. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considering making golf clubs as well in the future, but Wood said the company had not made a final decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods will make his next appearance at the President's Cup in mid-October. Having already won a record-setting $8.2 million this year, he could become the first player to reach $10 million in earnings in a single year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They were in the boot when they got stolen. It must have been only the third or fourth time I'd ever left my bags in the car overnight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sales reps in London have been mugged for samples - these are the lengths some people will go to to steal sportswear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Most of it wouldn't be available in the stores until next spring. It's from our All Conditions Gear range, which is pretty rare. We're very selective about which outlets sell it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and trading standards officers are hoping the designs will be too hard to copy for counterfeiters, but if the designs are successfully copied, they could be flogged on the internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dave O'Brien, trading standards manager at Newcastle City Council, said: "The internet is now one of the biggest marketplaces where people buy and sell stolen or counterfeit goods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is one of the areas our team is increasingly having to check."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest haul includes shirts, shorts, combat trousers and jackets which have never been on sale and 30 watches, two of which are prototypes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PC Colin Summer-scales, of Wallsend Police, said: "We understand this was one of only four sets in the UK".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Trading standards officers across the region are being notified in a bid to find the gear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr O'Brien said: "Some counterfeiters often have to wait until the sportswear is released before they can copy the designs, but this could give them advance warning for next year. But most bootleggers are only interested in printing a logo on a cheap T-shirt - this might be too complicated for most".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  NEVER before has football been so seductive to the advertiser. Euro 2000 has had financial injections from no less than 22 official sponsors and suppliers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Top brands - including Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, McDonald's and adidas - are battling fiercely for visibility during the tournament. This battle will intensify and the costs escalate as the new TV football revolution takes hold. The official backers are not only competing against each other, but against the hordes of other advertisers who want to grab the attention of some of the biggest and most captive audiences that television has to offer. Live football is one of the few TV products that needs to be watched there and then, not at some later time of the day when the result is known. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  For the bigger matches, the price of a prime-time, 30-second television spot has soared from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 80,000. Television companies and advertisers are benefiting from the Euro 2000 commercial bonanza as huge audiences and huge revenues combine to form a potent money-making opportunity. They will do even better when the new format kicks in next year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Take two of the most conspicuous rivals during this tournament, adidas and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The importance to them of cashing in on the football boom was highlighted at last week's International Advertising Association Congress when the top advertising gurus for each brand took the stage for a head-to-head debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tim Delaney (adidas) and Jim Riswold (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) agreed that it was not enough to spend millions on advertising - your ad had to be bigger and better than that of the opposition. But here the agreement ended.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The two brands have come up with radically different approaches in their ad campaigns for Euro 2000. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest commercial is a fierce blockbuster in which the brand's stars are sent on a mission to retrieve the Geo Motion football. Special-effects, fireballs and dungeons show that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  means business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas has chosen a more accessible approach with an advertisement set in a deserted Amsterdam square. A thousand footballs are let loose while a hidden camera films passers-by and top footballers enjoying the subsequent kickabout.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and adidas both focus on sport rather than fashion. Delaney boasts: "Adidas is a straight-through-the-rock sports brand. What other people do with adidas equipment is their problem. Adidas is only prepared to talk about sport."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Riswold claims that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approach is more personal: "Our ads talk athlete to athlete. We work on the principle that it is OK to satisfy your friend and ignore everybody else."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sports advertising exploded in the 1980s when Reebok overtook \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the No 1 sports brand. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  retaliated, storming on to our TV screens, closely followed by adidas. For a while there seemed to be a clear divide between the two. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was upbeat, letting its football stars show off their skills in settings such as international airports or Hackney Marshes. Adidas was dark: moody black-and-white footage and Massive Attack's churning music
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has taken on the mantle of aggression. Tony Barry, from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agency Wieden & Kennedy, says: "Adidas has successfully muddied the water. Their latest ad could be for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." Insiders at Wieden & Kennedy admit that adidas's latest ad has stolen a march on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Euro 2000 battle. Adidas has come up with a fresh approach, while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "mission" commercial is a tired hybrid of two of its earlier, more successful ads - the gladiatorial football match of "good versus evil" and the popular airport ad featuring Brazilian football stars.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The challenge to come up with ever-more imaginative ad campaigns has pushed the stars to greater prominence. But it is getting harder to impress an audience, even with coachloads of top athletes at your disposal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There was a time when it was amazing to see all the players together in one ad," says Barry. "Now the top players of the world are regularly seen together on TV playing in the (European) Champions' League, so the advertising has to go even further."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  All this advertising clutter means that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and adidas have to work harder than ever to make themselves heard. And in the battle for sporting supremacy, advertising creativity is the only way to win the game.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods has signed a five-year endorsement contract extension with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a company spokesman said Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those close to the negotiations declined to discuss the financial terms of the contract, but the Associated Press cites "a source close to the negotiations" saying it is for $100 million and the largest contract in sports marketing history.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf President Bob Wood said the only formality left in the yearlong negotiation process is receiving the signed contract in his office. He said he expects to receive it today. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The negotiating has been done for several weeks now," Wood said. "The only thing left is the logistics of physically having the contract here."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, said the contract has not yet been signed, but said the negotiations are complete and the signature is a mere formality.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "All of the deal points are in place," Steinberg said. "There are very few times in a player or an endorser's life that both truly feel they got what they deserved. But in this case they do. I would venture to say that Tiger is very happy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deal, which calls for Woods to continue wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothes and using \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  balls, is comparable in length to any deal Michael Jordan had while he was an active player, Wood said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jordan's endorsement contract terms were never made public, but Wood hinted that Woods' is worth more than anything Jordan made while active.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earl Woods, Tiger's father, said he did not know the financial details of the contract, but said if the $100 million speculation is correct, it's worth it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It doesn't surprise me at all," Earl Woods said. "He's worth every bit of it. And when the next contract comes around, this one will look like chump change and peanuts compared to that one."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earl Woods said the same thing in 1996, when, before Tiger hit a shot as a professional, he raised eyebrows by signing a reported five-year, $40 million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . That deal would have expired in September 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since then, Woods, now 24, has won 24 PGA Tour events and has won all four major championships. He holds the scoring record in the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open and shares the mark in the PGA Championship.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ONE of the world's most powerful sports powerbrokers yesterday delivered overwhelming endorsement of Sydney's Games preparations, predicting the 2000 Olympics would be the best yet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fresh from a first-hand inspection of the Olympic facilities, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  president Tom Clark also promised a few surprises at the Games from the sporting apparel giant. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Clark predicted scandals engulfing the Olympic movement and SOCOG last year would fade as September approached.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I think as we move closer to the Games, the focus will fall on the athletes and the competition," he said. "People will be looking forward to the performances of wonderful athletes. They want to taste the spirit of the Games."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Clark undertook ground and aerial tours of the Homebush site yesterday and came away impressed with the competition arenas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's fantastic. It looks to me as if they have done a tremendous job with the facilities. It's great for the athletes," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  boss, who has attended all the summer Olympic Games since Los Angeles in 1984, predicted Sydney would be remembered as the host of the best Games yet: "Without a doubt. I can't wait."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His remarks echo the view of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who offered a similar assessment earlier this month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The famous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swoosh is set to be one of the most recognisable images during the Games after the corporate heavyweight tied up a deal as an official sponsor last year, replacing rival brand Reebok. It will outfit the Australian Olympic and Paralympic teams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We ... look forward to contributing to the event," Mr Clark said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman's decision to race in full bodysuit was a psychological masterstroke, her coach Peter Fortune said yesterday, while the suit's maker will see it as a face-saver and a huge commercial bonus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman had worn the regulation team-issue two-piece outfit during the opening three rounds of her 400m, before changing into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bodysuit for the final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I though it was a bit of a masterstroke, the suit," Fortune said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "From my point of view she looked special down there. Everyone else was boom, boom, boom -- and then there was the phantom in lane six.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't know whether it really affected the other girls, but it made her look a bit special."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It first crossed Freeman's mind last month at Gateshead in England, but until she arrived at the Olympic Stadium late Monday afternoon she told no one she was going to wear the bodysuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman did her sponsor proud. After rumours of discontent within \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when star US sprinter Marion Jones chose not to wear her bodysuit during her 100m final on Saturday night, and the subsequent drugs scandal over Jones's husband CJ Hunter, Freeman brought the sportswear company some much-needed kudos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has spent tens of millions of dollars and many years developing the suit, so to have it left in the locker room at the main event would have been an embarrassment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It has so far failed to win over the athletic community in the way the neck-to-ankle equivalent in swimming has, although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be counting on the Freeman endorsement to change perceptions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I actually believe in the product," Freeman said yesterday. "I actually believe in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Swiftsuit. I just thought it would be an advantage to my performance."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The suit is designed to give the runner an aerodynamic edge. It is made up of five different fabrics, which are designed for different parts of the body, which move at different speeds during a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman first used it in race conditions in appalling weather at the August meeting in Gateshead and was reportedly pleased with the feel and performance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Kathryn Reith said yesterday Freeman's decision to wear the suit was her own. Reith also said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expected the suit to become regular running equipment in the future, but that it needed a pioneer to show how it worked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She denied that Freeman had been offered any financial inducement to wear the suit on Monday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was quick to capitalise on the Freeman victory, erecting a stream of posters around the Sydney CBD featuring Freeman in the bodysuit. The extra ads were an extension of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing campaign which has been running for about two weeks featuring Freeman and Jones.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman's decision to race in full bodysuit was a psychological masterstroke, her coach Peter Fortune said yesterday, while the suit's maker will see it as a face-saver and a huge commercial bonus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman had worn the regulation team-issue two-piece outfit during the opening three rounds of her 400m, before changing into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bodysuit for the final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I though it was a bit of a masterstroke, the suit," Fortune said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "From my point of view she looked special down there. Everyone else was boom, boom, boom -- and then there was the phantom in lane six.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't know whether it really affected the other girls, but it made her look a bit special."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It first crossed Freeman's mind last month at Gateshead in England, but until she arrived at the Olympic Stadium late Monday afternoon she told no one she was going to wear the bodysuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman did her sponsor proud. After rumours of discontent within \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when star US sprinter Marion Jones chose not to wear her bodysuit during her 100m final on Saturday night, and the subsequent drugs scandal over Jones's husband CJ Hunter, Freeman brought the sportswear company some much-needed kudos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has spent tens of millions of dollars and many years developing the suit, so to have it left in the locker room at the main event would have been an embarrassment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It has so far failed to win over the athletic community in the way the neck-to-ankle equivalent in swimming has, although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be counting on the Freeman endorsement to change perceptions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I actually believe in the product," Freeman said yesterday. "I actually believe in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Swiftsuit. I just thought it would be an advantage to my performance."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The suit is designed to give the runner an aerodynamic edge. It is made up of five different fabrics, which are designed for different parts of the body, which move at different speeds during a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman first used it in race conditions in appalling weather at the August meeting in Gateshead and was reportedly pleased with the feel and performance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman Kathryn Reith said yesterday Freeman's decision to wear the suit was her own. Reith also said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expected the suit to become regular running equipment in the future, but that it needed a pioneer to show how it worked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She denied that Freeman had been offered any financial inducement to wear the suit on Monday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was quick to capitalise on the Freeman victory, erecting a stream of posters around the Sydney CBD featuring Freeman in the bodysuit. The extra ads were an extension of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing campaign which has been running for about two weeks featuring Freeman and Jones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was not the only sponsor delighted with Freeman breaking convention. Qantas would have been delighted with Freeman's subliminal plug for the airline at a press conference on Monday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "All I know is that I've made a lot of people happy from all kinds of backgrounds who call Australia home and I'm happy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's a variation on the "I still call Australia home" theme, which Qantas has used for years in its television commercials and one that has obviously sunk into the Freeman psyche.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman is expected to don the suit again during the 200m, which starts today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  American superstar Marion Jones also wore a bodysuit once during the opening rounds of the 100m.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SIR ALEX Ferguson is being head-hunted by sportswear giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to become their football ambassador - on a massive contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talks between the Manchester United boss and the American-based company are at an advanced stage and Ferguson may sign a deal shortly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson has been targeted by the firm as the ideal man to front their push for top football contracts with clubs and players worldwide. He revealed he is considering one highly-lucrative job offer to United shareholders after being pursued by dozens of high-profile companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I've got a lot of offers already. One of them is really staggering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It would be a four-year contract for a huge amount of money and would involve a lot of travelling."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The salary being discussed is around pounds 1million-a-year on a four-year contract with VIP expenses, and the possibilities of bonuses are endless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may even be willing to offer Ferguson the job on a 'part-time' basis, leaving him to keep other interests in football and horse racing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ferguson is still intent on retiring from Old Trafford when his present contract runs out in two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As well as revealing aspects about his own future Ferguson explained how United plan to tempt the game's best players by offering shares in the club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They plan to introduce a share saver scheme in an effort to counter the incredible wages available in Italy and Spain.Instead of paying players pounds 100,000-a-week they could buy shares in the world's richest club at a special rate.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  OLYMPIC hopeful Cathy Freeman was roasted last month by some Aboriginal activists for toying with the word "sorry" in an advertisement for the sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The pressure applied by those members of the Aboriginal community paid off on Sunday when, in an interview with a British newspaper, Freeman turned on the current Australian Government and accused it of being responsible for separating her grandmother from her great-grandparents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman is not the first to apply such bizarre X-File dimensions to the blame game. Crossing time zones and investing current political personalities with the spectral identities and philosophies of long-dead politicians and public servants is par for the course among those in the Sorry Industry who do not wish to fairly acknowledge all aspects of past policies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Typical of the heat applied to Freeman in June were the remarks of National Sorry Day Committee chairman Audrey Kinnear who claimed "many Aboriginal people would be thinking that Cathy is guilty by association" because her sponsor, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , had used the word "sorry" repeatedly in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 its commercials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using 'sorry' so many times and in so many ways, they are actually trivialising what 'sorry' stands for," Ms Kinnear told this newspaper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not Cathy's fault, but I thought that with all the publicity, nationally and internationally, they would have been a bit more sensitive about it," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercials showed 20 athletes apologising to their family, friends and workmates for their obsession with sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, said "sorry" in a lighthearted manner for being driven by success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Teenage runner Georgie Clarke apologises to her school friends for training instead of walking home with them and embattled spin bowler Shane Warne says sorry to Dennis, in an apparent reference to breaking Dennis Lillee's wicket-taking record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman didn't actually say "sorry", but turned to the camera and said: "Can we talk about this later?" before running off into
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 the distance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Kinnear claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to exploit the reconciliation process and that the continuous use of the word "sorry" in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercials trivialised the issue of whether the Federal Government should apologise to the stolen generation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She might consider that the word "sorry" has not yet been entirely appropriated by the Black Armband Brigade and that there are many, many people indeed who manage to utter the expression meaningfully on a daily basis without once considering its connotations for Aboriginals, Esquimaux or even the Innuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman is said to be angered by a denial of the truth about the so-called Stolen Generation yet it would seem it is precisely the truth that eludes her appreciation of history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To be charitable, she is concentrating on her Olympic training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She can't be expected to have studied the documents regarding the so-called Stolen Generation, but there is no reason why those presenting her understandably emotional views should not fairly present the facts as well as her subjective opinion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  No matter how the statistics are juggled, the record clearly shows that there was never a "stolen generation". The term is inaccurate but highly emotive and thus more likely to be seized upon by those more interested in making political capital than in dealing with disadvantaged people. Just as Freeman's own heartfelt but misguided words
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 were yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even historian Peter Read, whose work has been credited with giving rise to Sir Ronald Wilson's painfully flawed Lost Children inquiry, has conceded that his estimate of 100,000 separations was "misunderstood" and "far too high".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There is no doubt that Cathy Freeman is a great Australian.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Her athletic achievements bring the nation to its feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a runner, she is also a great role model. Her grasp of history and understanding of policy, however, is at about the same level of her knowledge of her own business dealings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And that according to her new business manager and accountant, Alistair Hamblin, is small indeed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But, having now bowed to the politics of her Aboriginal critics, let's hope she will be left alone to prepare herself to run for her nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In that field of endeavour, she surely carries the best wishes of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 all Australians, regardless of colour or creed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman today came under fire for her involvement in an athletic shoe advertisement that prominently features the word sorry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ad features several athletes looking at the camera as the word sorry appears on screen. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Towards the end, Aboriginal star Freeman turns around as she is running, mouthing the words: "Can we talk about this later?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Audrey Kinnear, co-chairwoman of the National Sorry Day Committee, said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad trivialised the importance of the word, which is closely associated with Aboriginal reconciliation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If viewers around the nation feel like I do, and like many other Aboriginal people would be feeling, then Cathy is guilty by association," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We all love Cathy and I think one of the hardest things, and the most painful things, is when our own people are used against us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should have made Freeman aware of the implications of the ad, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using sorry in so many ways and so many times, they are actually trivialising what sorry stands for."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing director Brent Scamshaw denied the accusation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Everybody in Australia right now wants a piece of Cathy Freeman, whether it be media calls, whether it be Cathy just trying to live her life on a day-to-day basis," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I guess we shot the commercial with that insight in mind and at the end of the day Cathy's sole focus is on performing in Sydney 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I think the only coincidence is the use of the word sorry."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTS goods manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday insisted there was no evidence that some of its British-made football shirts were laced with a toxic chemical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fears have been raised over the safety of shirts of German side Borussia Dortmund after a German TV show commissioned lab tests and claimed the shirts contain a chemical used on the bottom of sea vessels, which is also used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman yesterday confirmed the Borussia Dortmund shirts were made in Britain and Italy. He refused to say where in Britain they were made. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He repeated that initial testing had failed to find any Tributyltin, or TBT. "Initial research findings suggest that TBT is not used in production of the garment," he said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also make shirts for Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers, though not in Britain, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Both clubs reported no concern over their shirts. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said Borussia Dortmund shirts were made by sub contractors in Britain which specialised in manufacturing football shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Further tests are being carried out and we await the results of those," he said. "We are consulting outside industry experts and fabric suppliers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He repeated the company's message to the public - "Don't panic".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And he added: "Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A scientist with a German institute for consumer health has said that TBT at high levels in humans is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyse the risks," Juergen Kundke said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn't be in textiles that people wear."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Three German department store chains have withdrawn the 47 yellow and black shirts, as a precaution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  British and Dutch tests have shown that TBT can cause mutations in marine snails, and there have been calls for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has said it does not appear British retailers are following their German counterparts by withdrawing the kit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The spokesman said it makes Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers shirts, but not in this country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An Arsenal spokeswoman said: "We have discussed the matter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and at the present time have no cause to recall any replica shirts from our club shops."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman, the runner who gave Australia its greatest sporting thrill on Monday night, yesterday pledged to return to a normal life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But armed with a gold medal, Freeman has already moved another step away from the normality she craves -- and the marketing and political spotlights intensified on her yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Within hours of her winning the 400m grand final at the Olympic Games, 220 billboards in Sydney had been altered by sportswear manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to reflect its association with the nation's latest sports superstar. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Cathy Freeman, official sponsor of joy to the Sydney 2000 Olympics," the new posters declared across a picture of the triumphant runner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The billboards were to be followed by new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  television advertisements on the Seven network last night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman boosted her sponsor's campaign by wearing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit in Monday night's run. Yesterday, though, she was talking about a life beyond athletics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't know if it gets better than this," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One thing she craves is to be out of the limelight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "In my simple world, I wake up in the morning and have breakfast and I clean my teeth, life is very normal when I'm on my own. The only thing that will change after this is the way the public treats me, I think.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I know my family sure won't, though. Everything will settle down after this euphoria has gone and I'll just be a family member."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley used the biggest event in Australian sport to push one of the biggest issues in Australian society, describing her Olympic victory as "400 metres of national reconciliation".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ATSIC chairman Geoff Clark said her popular win would increase pressure on Prime Minister John Howard to apologise to Aborigines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the Prime Minister pointedly avoided being drawn on any link between Freeman and reconciliation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Look, I think everybody's happy for her and very happy for what it represents," Mr Howard said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "She's a role model to young Australians, Aboriginal Australians and other Australians."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CATHY Freeman, the runner who gave Australia its greatest sporting thrill on Monday night, yesterday pledged to return to a normal life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But armed with a gold medal, Freeman has already moved another step away from the normality she craves -- and the marketing and political spotlights intensified on her yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Within hours of her winning the 400m grand final at the Olympic Games, 220 billboards in Sydney had been altered by sportswear manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to reflect its association with the nation's latest sports superstar. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Cathy Freeman, official sponsor of joy to the Sydney 2000 Olympics," the new posters declared across a picture of the triumphant runner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The billboards were to be followed by new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  television advertisements on the Seven network last night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman boosted her sponsor's campaign by wearing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit in Monday night's run. Yesterday, though, she was talking about a life beyond athletics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't know if it gets better than this," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One thing she craves is to be out of the limelight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "In my simple world, I wake up in the morning and have breakfast and I clean my teeth, life is very normal when I'm on my own. The only thing that will change after this is the way the public treats me, I think.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I know my family sure won't, though. Everything will settle down after this euphoria has gone and I'll just be a family member."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley used the biggest event in Australian sport to push one of the biggest issues in Australian society, describing her Olympic victory as "400 metres of national reconciliation".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ATSIC chairman Geoff Clark said her popular win would increase pressure on Prime Minister John Howard to apologise to Aborigines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the Prime Minister pointedly avoided being drawn on any link between Freeman and reconciliation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Look, I think everybody's happy for her and very happy for what it represents," Mr Howard said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "She's a role model to young Australians, Aboriginal Australians and other Australians."

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DALLAS -- As Larry Miller settled into his new job at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , he discovered selling Michael Jordan shoes and apparel would be much tougher than he'd imagined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In June 1998, when Miller arrived on the scene, the basketball superstar was making more money than any other athlete in corporate endorsements. Six months later, Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We lost the very best marketing tool that we could ever have had: Michael slam-dunking slam-dunking on (ESPN's) SportsCenter every night," Miller said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Miller, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jordan brand, has spent the last 15 months trying to pump up the business despite Jordan's defection to the suit-and-tie world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a tricky balancing act: Retain a retired athlete's image of athleticism and style while keeping the appeal fresh with a new generation of stars.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  launch of the Jordan brand represents a departure for the athletic shoe business. Stand-alone brands are common in such industries as automobiles and beer, but sneakers have always been identified as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nikes\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Reeboks or Adidas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Jordan is a great opportunity to introduce a brand that doesn't carry the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name," said Rick Burton, director of the University of Oregon's Warsaw Center for Sports Marketing. "Now, a kid can say 'I'm wearing Jordans.' This is going to allow them to stretch their marketing in new ways."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a player, Jordan proved to be a marketing juggernaut, pitching Hanes underwear, Rayovac batteries, MCI WorldCom telephone services, Gatorade sports drinks and a half-dozen other products.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year Jordan decided to stop endorsing products that aren't tied to his business interests, said his agent, David Falk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jordan has been a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fixture since he signed with the company in 1984. Repositioning the Jordan brand involved tweaking the marketing pitch, Miller said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Michael is no longer playing basketball, we know that," he said. "We've got to go out and add other athletes who are relevant to the consumer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jordan and Miller signed a half-dozen athletes they regard as worthy of the Jordan brand. Dallas Mavericks star Michael Finley joins other players from the National Basketball Association, such as Ray Allen and Eddie Jones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Outside basketball, the Jordan brand recruited shortstop Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, wide receiver Randy Moss of the Minnesota Vikings and boxer Roy Jones Jr.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Jordan brand's first major post-retirement test came a few months ago with the launch of Air Jordan XV, the latest version of a long line of signature basketball shoes. Previous Air Jordans were big sellers, so the expectations at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., were high.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although he's only 38, Jordan won't make a comeback. Last year, he bought a stake in the NBA's Washington Wizards, becoming team president, and he's involved in other business ventures, including MVP.com, an Internet sporting goods retailer formed with hockey's Wayne Gretzky and football's John Elway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite the hectic schedule, he remains the chief executive officer of Jordan brand and consults with Miller at least once a week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "None of our clothes or shoes hit the market until Michael has a chance to see it, change it and approve it," Miller said. "He's always going to be in the picture."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has moved to reassure consumers after reports some of its football shirts were laced with a toxic chemical used in anti-barnacle paint on ships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fears were raised over the safety of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -made shirts of German side Borussia Dortmund after a German TV show commissioned lab tests on the kit and reported its findings earlier this week. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The TV show claimed the shirts contain a chemical used on the bottom of sea vessels, which is also used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  British and Dutch tests have shown that Tributyltin or TBT can cause mutations in marine snails and there have been calls for its global ban.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At high levels in humans, it is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist with a German institute for consumer health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyse the risks," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn't be in textiles that people wear."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Many German stores have stopped selling the pounds 47 yellow and black shirts and one is pulling other official team jerseys as a precaution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman urged Britons not to panic and said it was conducting its own tests on the shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The spokesman said that initial testing failed to detect any TBT in the jerseys, but further tests were necessary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said that it did not appear British retailers were following their German counterparts by withdrawing the kit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Our message is simple - don't panic," the spokesman said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are conducting tests and as such have not withdrawn any of the shirts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In what could prove a damaging blow to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  image in Germany, leading German retailers yanked soccer jerseys made by the company from store shelves yesterday after televised reports that the jerseys contained a potentially harmful fungicide used on boat hulls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The reports claimed that the chemical, tributyltin or TBT, had been found in souvenir jerseys made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with the name and logo of Borussia Dortmund, a popular professional soccer team. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is unclear whether the substance was deliberately applied to the jerseys. It is also unclear whether it was found in the fibers of the jerseys or the decorations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said the company was testing the jerseys at labs in Germany and in the United States, and in the meantime was not recalling the jerseys from its own stores.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's nothing conclusive to show that there is a health risk to the public," said the spokesman, Vada Manager. "But obviously, consumer concern is important to us. We want to conduct the tests to ensure that there is no chemical agent in the jerseys that can be a risk to the public." He said the tests should be completed within the next several days.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tributyltin is used to kill bacteria in textiles and is an ingredient in paint used on ships' hulls to discourage barnacle growth. It is strongly irritating to skin and can cause burns. At high levels, it can cause nerve and liver problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report was shown on Tuesday night on a business news show called "Plus Minus," in which reporters tested randomly chosen consumer products, including carpet samples and ski socks, for traces of chemicals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 German television yesterday reported that sporting-goods chains, including Karstadt and Kaufhof, two of the biggest, had removed the Borussia Dortmund jerseys made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from their stores. Other souvenir jerseys were also removed, including those of FC Kaiserslauten and Hertha BSC, said a spokesman for Intersport Deutschland, a buyers' cooperative that represents 1,600 retailers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, one German newspaper reported yesterday that the Green Party had called on the Bavarian parliament to conduct its own investigation into the presence of tributyltin in clothing and other textiles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Relations are already tense between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and big sporting-goods retailers like Karstadt, said Bob Carr, the editor of SGB's Inside Sporting Goods, a trade publication in New York. The problem is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  functions as both manufacturer and retailer, opening up big stores like the Berlin Niketown that companies like Karstadt fear will undercut them on prices. "The German trade does not like manufacturers in the retail business," Mr. Carr said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has feuded with the German stores over pricing, trying to avoid paying a 3 percent premium on orders that is used by the stores for collective advertising and marketing. "We wanted to make sure the consumer got the best value, and it affected the amount of raw profit they would make," Mr. Manager said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One analyst said there would be little effect on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "It's really a small part of the business," said Jennifer E. Black, president of Black & Company, an investment firm in Portland, Ore. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been doing extremely well in Germany. I don't see this as being an issue." In a conference call with investors last month, she added, the company said it was "working our way through some issues" in Germany but was generally upbeat about its prospects.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I'm sorry. I saw \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  television advertisement featuring a fleeting Cathy Freeman spinning her "can we talk about this later?" line and recognised it as a clever play on a highly emotive, in-vogue word.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Much in the same vein as Benetton uses sensitive social issues to dress shop windows and sell jumpers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tapped into the national sorry campaign, added a commercial twist and produced a timely, if controversial ad. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not that there's anything wrong with being commercially savvy, but selling sports shoes and clothes on the back of the reconciliation campaign has upset Aboriginal activists who are disappointed Freeman is involved and want the ad withdrawn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Critics say the commercial, which features a wide array of athletes saying sorry for much lesser sins than stealing a generation of Aboriginal children is insensitive, exploitive and opportunistic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has also dropped Freeman into yet another stink. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is Freeman's biggest sponsor, backing her to the tune of a minimum $500,000 annually, rising to $700,000 depending on exchange and success rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever Freeman turns at the moment she is surrounded by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , at home, on the track, in court. But while being omnipresent, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also becoming omnipotent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 27-year-old left Australia in May to escape the pressure of being Australia's only gold medal favourite in track and field.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since her timely exit, however, she's attracted more publicity than if she had been quietly training at Olympic Park in Melbourne and going home to her new house in Kew.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At her side is husband Sandy Bodeck-er, an American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executive who's job is concentrated more on tending the needs of his very talented wife than the profits of a multinational sports company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her new publicist as of May 10, Royce Sport, is an arm of Royce Communications, which has \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a client.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In court, where she is being sued by her former manger, Nick Bideau, and his Melbourne International Track Club for alleged breach of contract, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is involved with both parties in the proceedings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  backs Freeman it also helps sustain the MITC with $250,000 annually. That money gives the company access to a raft of Freeman's contemporaries plus a link to the next generation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The club is in court fighting to maintain that sponsorship after Freeman appointed another manager and requested her sponsors send monies directly to her, ie not via the MITC.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest on the court case is that there is no latest since the judge deferred the matter in the Victorian Supreme Court last Friday and told both parties to start talking in private.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to MITC, it has continued to request the initiation of out-of-court negotiations with Freeman's legal advisers but has received no response.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then, four days after having her personal details revealed in court, Freeman was again in the headlines, this time because she's upset some by featuring in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman left Australia to seek peace and quiet before the Olympics, not to become the centre of court disputes and advertising campaigns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Elsewhere, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is negotiating with Athletics Australia whether to continue supplying the national team with uniforms plus a cash element to support junior development after its contract expires at the end of the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also outfitting the Olympic team, which means that Freeman will be flying the company colours when she lines up for that gold medal Australia has already banked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If she ends up with anything less, it will be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who'll be sorry.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls in TV and magazine ads, but he really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged Tuesday after being sued in federal court.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the balls Woods uses for his monster swings that produce 300-plus-yard drives have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball," said Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros really use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products: irons, putters and golf balls for tour players," Kelly said. "Slight specification and modifications need to be made to their equipment for their game."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly what their pros endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe Gomes, a spokesperson for Titleist of Fairhaven, Mass., said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a "tweaked" version of a club, he said, a consumer could special order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are very particular about our advertisements," said Gomes. "We don't make any claims that cannot be substantiated in both golf balls and clubs."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Callaway Golf of Carlsbad, Calif., said if one of its golf pros says he uses a certain club, that identical club is available retail. Spokesperson Larry Dorman did say, however, that in February, one of its golf balls had a different number of dimples on it than the ones its pros used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That occurred, he said, because Callaway was awaiting approval of the new ball by the U.S. Golfing Association, so the company's pros were briefly forbidden from using it in tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We used a prototype with a different number of dimples," Dorman said. "As a result, for a very short period of time, there was a little bit of a lapse from what was being marketed. We were very up front about it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the lawsuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. district court in San Francisco, a nonprofit group called Public Remedies Inc. claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , based in Beaverton, Ore., was engaging in unfair business practices. It asks that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "ill-gotten gains" be restored to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Tiger Woods does not play the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf ball, but instead plays one with a different composition and performance characteristics specially made for him ... and not available to the general public," the suit said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group did not return repeated calls for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods officially switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball before the U.S. Open, the first of his three major championships this year. The move officially ended a marketing conflict between Woods' top two golf sponsors -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist -- that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist argued that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was using Woods to promote golf balls because of two commercials -- one that showed Woods bouncing a ball off his wedge, and another that showed hackers on the range belting 300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked Woods' deal so he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have its logo on his bag and to use Woods in advertisements. #

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come under fire for using Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in a TV commercial featuring the word "sorry" 15 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman plays only a minor role in the commercial, but the timing of its release has stung Aboriginal activists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  National Sorry Day Committee chairman Audrey Kinnear claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to exploit the reconciliation process. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Kinnear said the continuous use of the word "sorry" trivialised the issue of whether the Federal Government should apologise to the stolen generation of Aborigines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Why select a word that is current, politically and nationally?" she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using sorry so many times and in so many ways, they are actually trivialising what sorry stands for."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has used 20, mainly Olympic, athletes who apologise to their family, friends and workmates for an obsession with sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, say sorry in a light-hearted manner for being driven by success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Teenage runner Georgie Clarke apologises to her school friends for training instead of walking home with them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Embattled spin bowler Shane Warne says sorry to Dennis, in an apparent reference to breaking Dennis Lillee's wicket-taking record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The commercial also features a weightlifter apologising for eating all the eggs in the fridge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman doesn't actually say sorry, but turns to the camera and says, "Can we talk about this later?" before running off into the distance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympics spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the timing of the "sorry" commercial was purely coincidental.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Ryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to show how athletes had to apologise to a lot of people they did not have time for during Olympic preparations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "While we understand there is some sensitivity and contention around the sorry issue, it was more a behind-the-scenes look at athletes who make no apologies for the fact that they have to say sorry to a lot of people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Sorry is word used by people every day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a coincidence that the whole reconciliation issue has come up here."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Ryan said the insight into Freeman was more about the fact that everybody wanted "a piece of Cathy" in the lead-up to Sydney 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not in reference to the reconciliation issue."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Ms Kinnear said Aborigines were offended that Freeman was being "used" to capitalise on the reconciliation debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I thought that with all the publicity, nationally and internationally, they would have been a bit more sensitive about it," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Kinnear said she did not blame Freeman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not Cathy's fault, but many Aboriginal people would be thinking that Cathy is guilty by association."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman's Olympic preparations were disrupted last week when her former lover and manager took court action against the world champion for alleged breach of contract.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW YORK - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been accused of offering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Royal Dutch Shell and other global giants the right to use the UN emblem to "bluewash" their images.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chief executives of 50 corporates have been invited by Annan to come to UN headquarters in New York today to sign up for a "partnership" scheme to end Third World sweatshops and environmental abuses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among those invited are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Shell, and the mining giant Rio Tinto, all accused in the past of human rights violations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The scheme will commit them to upholding nine key principles including the rights of workers to unionise, the elimination of child labour and the development of environmentally friendly technologies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But "the global compact" plan has provoked fury among aid and environmental agencies who say it will allow companies, notorious for human rights violations, to use the UN emblem to give their activities a branding makeover, while doing nothing of substance to clean up their activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It allows companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the global symbol of sweatshops, to wrap themselves in the UN flag without any binding commitment to change," said Joshua Karliner, executive director of the San Francisco-based corporate monitoring group Transnational Resource and Action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This will enhance the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brand name and could be a powerful marketing tool."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The same companies taking part in Annan's initiative are at the same time lobbying furiously, said Karliner, to undermine a letter to the Secretary-General signed by 20 non-governmental agencies that said the initiative implied UN official policy was to support corporate-driven globalisation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It said that the voluntary nature of the deal would let corporations "wrap themselves in the flag of the UN to 'bluewash' their public image while at the same time avoiding significant changes to their behaviour."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The scheme will require companies to post on a UN website their actions to end sweatshop conditions and prevent environmental degradation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, they will be under no obligation to observe a code of conduct or a set of minimum standards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Critics say the plan will undermine existing efforts by other UN agencies to force Governments to hold companies accountable to existing UN conventions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Ruggie, chief adviser to Annan, defended the initiative, saying it reflected concern in the UN at the unfettered growth of globalisation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is an experiment, it is a very unusual initiative which brings all sides of the debate together on a common platform but I would be very surprised if the companies involved tried to pull the wool over our eyes."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the initiative was aimed at launching a dialogue accompanied by practical actions, rather than a binding code of conduct that would take years to negotiate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's about making the world a better place."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Awareness of many key Sydney Olympic Games sponsors has fallen in the past year, although the profile of global sporting giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has rocketed following its last-minute replacement of Reebok as the Australian team's official outfitter. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the 13th annual Sweeney Sports Report, public awareness of Olympic sponsors Telstra, Westpac, Ansett, Coca-Cola and Holden all fell in 1999. Sweeney Sports director Mr Martin Hirons attributed the falls to a deliberate slowing of marketing activity after recent Olympic controversies and ahead of a boom later this year, when sponsors' marketing efforts are expected to intensify .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Clearly the marketing activities associated with the sponsorships have been fairly low key," Mr Hirons told The Australian Financial Review. "The expenditure required to maintain that is significant, and it does take a huge amount of resources. In hindsight I would say it was a strategic decision, but clearly one I think was necessitated."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness among the public as an Olympic sponsor has jumped from 2 per cent a year ago to almost double that of the previous leader, Telstra. In order of awareness, the top Olympic sponsors were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Telstra, McDonald's, AMP, Ansett and Westpac.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While awareness of individual sponsors was generally weaker, the Sweeney Sports Report showed the number of mainland Australia residents able to name at least one Olympic sponsor had risen from 58 per cent to 64 per cent, more than double the number three years ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the controversies which have dogged SOCOG appear to be taking a toll on the public's perception of the event's key backers. About 38 per cent of those surveyed had a less favourable attitude towards sponsors, with a similar proportion indicating the troubles had dissuaded them from buying tickets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Hirons attributed the overall increase in awareness almost solely to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which in December replaced Reebok as the official clothing supplier of the Australian team and has athletes Cathy Freeman and US star Michael Johnson in its stable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That [overall awareness] is particularly attributable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involvement," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sweeney Sports surveyed 1,500 people in mainland capital cities in January, just a month after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  replaced Reebok as a sponsor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report also showed swimming is the Olympic sport most Australians are interested in. Some 86 per cent of those surveyed expressed interest in the sport, followed by track and field (86 per cent), gymnastics (62 per cent), tennis (58 per cent) and the marathon (57 per cent).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The opening and closing ceremonies were also of interest, attracting 63 per cent and 55 per cent respectively. Rowing fell 10 per cent to 38 per cent while cycling dropped 6 per cent to 49 per cent.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 As youth numbers shrink, companies cultivating women, older consumers
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Knowing they need to broaden their appeal in order to survive, sporting-goods makers are expanding lineups of fashionable casual wear for women and products for light exercise targeted at older customers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Companies in the field are struggling to cope with a shrinking population of young people, particularly young men who have been the primary market focus up to now, as well as a decline in the popularity of participation sports.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Japan Corp. launched what it calls its "women's project" at the end of last year. Staff members analyze the preferences of female consumers who do not play sports, focusing on casual wear for young women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. has greatly expanded its lineup of women's casual wear to 100 items from 40 in three years, and plans to introduce a new brand next year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The firm in February opened its first sales outlet exclusively for women at a fitness club in Tokyo. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hopes to forge a strong brand image among women by displaying casual wear along with sports shirts and shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Light exercise
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asics Corp. is also trying to adapt to the shifting market currents. "We are actively marketing merchandise for light exercise to take advantage of growing health awareness among middle-aged and older people," said Mitsuhiro Kimura, manager of Asics' athletic sportswear division.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though the number of people taking part in organized sports is declining, more middle-aged and older people are enjoying light exercise, such as walking. Aware of this trend, Asics inaugurated its Fitness Walking Project three years ago to emphasize the development of sports shoes for older people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Kobe-based firm is also concentrating more on women's swimsuits. It plans to release a new item in its Como Diana line by the end of September. With a 30cm-long zipper down the center, the new swimsuit is easy to put on and take off, company officials said. It has been designated a universal fashion product, which means it can be easily used by senior citizens and people with physical disabilities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reebok Japan Inc. also plans to start marketing a new brand next year targeting women. The Kawasaki-based subsidiary of Reebok International Ltd. of the U.S. plans to release some 45 items under the Comfort Premium label.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of people who play such games as baseball and soccer is on the decline, according to a recent government study. Although the number of joggers is increasing, the sporting-goods market has been on a losing streak since hitting a 1996 peak at some 2.6 trillion yen. Sales slid to 2.3 trillion yen last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite strong efforts by sporting-goods makers to expand the market, "women and older customers do not visit sporting-goods sales counters as frequently as young men," explained Asics' Kimura.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It can be difficult finding a pair of shoes that fit perfectly, sometimes half sizes are not available and it's even more annoying when one foot is bigger than the other. But help is at hand. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has launched a lightweight shoe and a radicla shoe-size concept. Tha Air Presto comes in only six sizes, ranging from XXS to XL, and is a running shoe that adjusts to the size of your foot so it fits like a sock. As you put the Air Presto on, the mesh around the body of the shoe stretches to fit perfectly and the support cage around the mid-foot holds the foot in place once the laces are tightened. They are as comfortable as slippers and buying them is a little like choosing a T-shirt - 'Medium, please' - but, hey presto, it's a made-to-measure shoe. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air Presto, pounds 70, comes in a wide range of colours and is available from all major sports retailers, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Town, Oxford Circus, London W1 (020 7612 0800).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Perfect match
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If wering trainers is not your style, a designer alternative could be right up your street. Prada's (020 7629 0666) metallic shoes, pounds 155, are stylish and sporty. Bertie (020 7380 3800) has its own version, too, at a third of the price - pounds 50.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vince Carter's shoe problems with Puma appear to be over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Toronto Raptors superstar has signed a six-year endorsement contract worth $30 million US with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to a report on HoopsTV.com.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Signing Carter would be a major coup for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , giving the shoe giant perhaps the NBA's most popular player since Michael Jordan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said between $18 and $20 million US of the $30 million US will go to Puma to free Carter from his previous shoe contract, the report said quoting anonymous sources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But lawyer Norman Oberstein, from the firm Oberstein, Kibre and Horowitz that represents Puma, said no agreement is pending.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talks are progressing "satisfactorily," Oberstein said yesterday. "There isn't anything pending. We're just trying to work things out and, hopefully, we will."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The relationship between Carter and Puma soured last season, when the player complained about the footwear the company provided him. This summer, an arbitrator ruled Carter owes Puma $13.5 million US for breaching his endorsement contract by publicly denouncing Puma's shoes and negotiating with other companies while under contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ruling also said Carter was responsible for Puma's legal fees (about $1 million US) and prohibited him from signing an endorsement deal with another company for three years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oberstein said Carter would need permission from Puma to negotiate with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . When asked if Puma had granted him that permission, he refused to comment, saying only that any agreement would be announced promptly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said the three sides were ironing out the final details of the deal, with Puma demanding a cut of royalties generated by Carter's future with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes. Carter's agent, IMG's Mark Steinberg was travelling and unavailable for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter is in Hawaii training with the U.S. Olympic team.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This will not be in the least surprising to parents who have had to stump up for new trainers recently, especially if you have a trend-setting teenager who desperately wants a particular brand-name.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But students in America are taking on the might of the corporate sports manufacturing giants likes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Adidas in a protest movement which is said to be the biggest student unrest since the 1960s. Already this year there have been 16 organised sit-ins at university buildings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Students are protesting about sweatshop factories which they claim are used to turn out university-endorsed clothing and sportswear - companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Reebok give lucrative sponsorship deals to American sports colleges and universities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The main aim of the United Students Against Sweatshops campaign is to raise public awareness about the conditions found in some Third World country production lines. The campaign is working.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Already \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been forced for the first time to publish the locations of their factories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also universities have accepted student demands to sign up with the Workers Rights Consortium, a body made up of human rights and labour campaigners, university officials and students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campaigner Molly McGrath explained: 'Our clothes shouldn't be made by people who are treated like slaves - it's an easy thing to understand.i
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And as a parent (I must declare a financial, self-interest here), I would be more than happy if kids in this country decided that it was uncool to buy expensive, brand name sports gear too.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The world's highestpaid shoe salesman dropped in to town last week for a fortnight of product placement. But first he had to find somewhere to run.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The management of Michael Johnson, reigning Olympic champion at the 200 and the 400 metres, had to scramble after the star arrived at the chosen training track E.S. Marks Field in Sydney's Moore Park to discover it had been closed by the local council.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hoping to avoid media attention and still find somewhere to train, they contacted the Australian athletics team. Eventually Johnson and his fast feet were able to stretch out on a track at Narrabeen along the city's northern beaches. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday, though, those feet were carefully enclosed when the American fronted a media conference near the Olympic Village. Ostensibly it was to discuss his form coming into the Games, but really it was another chance to sell shoes, specifically \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes even if no one else can actually buy the pair he is flogging. For a while there were questions about his fitness (much better since his hamstring injury during the United States selection trials in July), his form (very strong in Europe recently) and his confidence (even higher than usual because he is not running the 200m this time).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is my last Olympics and I want to be able to enjoy it a lot more," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then out came two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  designers carrying a shiny drawstring bag. It contained "the shoe", an item many of us had apparently been anticipating ever since Johnson wore a goldcoloured pair on his way to victory in Atlanta.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new shoe turned out to be gold again, although this time it was real gold, as in 24carat gold droplets around the outside. Real gold droplets are supposed to help with flexibility (true). Wearing gold on your shoes also has an instant "retinal impact", as one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  techheads so coyly put it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And that means a massive boost to worldwide sales, of course, especially if Johnson wins again. That's why they started developing this shoe in December 1997, studying slowmotion replays and consulting endlessly with Johnson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now the 33yearold Texan just has to win on Monday night, a relatively sure prospect given the way he has dominated the 400m event during the past decade. Johnson said it's history that motivated him when he competed. History fulfilled as in the first man to win the 200 and 400 at the Olympics (Atlanta, 1996), and history planned as in the first man to successfully defend his 400 Olympic title (Sydney 2000).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then there's the records, times that are "so far out there that it's hard to understand," as he succinctly explained. His world record for the 200 19.32 seconds set in the Atlanta final was the first example. To mortals, his second world record 43.18 for the 400, set at the world championships last year in Seville also qualifies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But not to Johnson, who thinks that given ideal conditions, a time below 43 seconds is possible perhaps as early as Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't know when it's going to come, but I'm running out of time. As soon as possible!"

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It will probably remain forever one of the biggest mysteries in world football. Since July 12, 1998, acres of newsprint and hour upon hour of broadcasting time have been devoted to the question of whether Ronaldo should have played in the World Cup final against France and who decided that he should play.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The world's greatest footballer, taking the field just hours after he had suffered a fit, was a shadow of himself as Brazil were comprehensively beaten 3-0 by the hosts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To add to the mystery, his name had not appeared on the original team-sheet published shortly before kick-off. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The question that has been repeatedly asked since that day concerns \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , whose shirt deal with Brazil is the most lucrative in the world between a sportswear manufacturer and a national football team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Did \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  put pressure on Brazil to include Ronaldo for their own commercial reasons? The company said at the time that it was "absurd and insulting" to suggest it had influenced team selection. While the current inquiry by the Brazilian Congress into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal has not provided a definitive answer, the inquiry has revealed how great a say \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have in the national team's affairs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The biggest revelation has been that Mario Zagallo, the national coach during the World Cup, had been on an individual contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for a year up until the World Cup finals. Zagallo's own role in the selection of Ronaldo has been the subject of much debate and that he was on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  payroll can only add weight to accusations that the sportswear company may have had some input into team selection in France.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lidio Toledo, Brazil's chief doctor at the World Cup, told the inquiry that one of the reasons why he had cleared Ronaldo to play was that he was afraid of being lynched at home had the striker been ruled out and Brazil defeated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Edmundo, a member of the squad, told the commission that Ronaldo had woken up unaware that he had suffered a fit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The doctors were reluctant to tell him and it was only on the insistence of a team-mate, Leonardo, that Ronaldo was taken to hospital. Edmundo, however, is not regarded as the most credible of witnesses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He is a wayward personality who had a vested interest in whether Ronaldo played or not as he would have been in the starting lineup had Ronaldo not been selected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On one key point, however, his evidence is backed up by other sources. Edmundo says that Zagallo was told of Ronaldo's problem within 15 minutes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was the same story from Toledo, an old friend of Zagallo, and has subsequently been backed up in a press interview by the team captain, Dunga. Zagallo, however, has always insisted that he was sleeping at the time and was only told some three hours afterwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When they decided to enter the football market, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw they had to have Brazil, everyone's favourite other team. However, further research left them worried. In Brazil there was no tradition of the national side being in constant activity. The squad were called up for bursts for a World Cup, or Copa America for example.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Part of the deal, therefore, included the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tour, five games a year (which time restrictions have since reduced to two) where Brazil would be matched against opponents the company chose. To ensure the spectacle was worthy of the company's investment, eight recognised first-team players had to be included.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were concerned that they might not get a fair hearing from the Brazilian legal system, the company reserved the right to take contractual disputes to a court anywhere in the world, while the Brazilian federation could take cases only to Zurich.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The business practices of an especially aggressive multinational, and their apparent lack of trust in their partner, led to an unprecedented corporate level of involvement with a national team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In theory it looked so simple: Brazil enchant the world with wonderful football; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  creams off profit and prestige.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  omnipresent airport lounge commercial had helped stoke the myth of a Dream Team something which never, even briefly, presented itself on the field. When the bubble burst the biggest casualty was Ronaldo, whose mind and body gave way under the strain of carrying a wilting team through to the World Cup final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Caught between modern business pressures and traditional national pride, his broken career is a monument to the dangers of such a potent cocktail.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods is making the switch to the swoosh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After testing a new ball during competition in Germany and in the Memorial Tournament, Woods said Thursday he will formally switch to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball when he plays the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in two weeks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods finished third in the Deutsche Bank Open, and then won the Memorial last week by five strokes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''I think it's done pretty good so far,'' he said last week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The announcement officially ends a marketing conflict between Woods' top two golf sponsors - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist - that began last year when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the ball market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Titleist argued that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was using Woods to promote golf balls because of two commercials - one that showed Woods bouncing a ball off his wedge, another that showed hackers on the range belting 300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CEO Wally Uihlein contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked Woods' deal so that he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have its logo on his bag and to use Woods in advertisements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Clearly, these were signs and signals suggestive that different futures were in the cards for both parties, '' Uihlein said in a statement Thursday. ''Titleist has never been about one player, but rather a 50-year history of being the most played ball by more of the best players.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods was in Oregon on Thursday for a dedication at Pumpkin Ridge, where he won his third straight U.S. Amateur, and to attend a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sales meeting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''I understand the conflicts that were inherent in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  introduction of a golf ball,'' Woods said in a statement through IMG. ''I especially appreciate the way Wally, personally, and Titleist have handled this in a professional manner.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods is expected to continue playing Titleist clubs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He began testing balls earlier this year while at home in Florida, and he put the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball in play for the first time in Germany.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Tour Accuracy version he played the past two weeks is a multi- layer ball that spins less, something Woods has been working on the past year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Obviously, it feels different,'' he said last week at the Memorial. ''Any time you hit a two-piece ball versus a wound ball, you're going to feel a dramatic difference. But the performance, the cover, feels very similar to mine.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods said the wound ball tended to peak a little more in flight, while two-piece balls were more likely to be a little more flat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's going to fly a little bit different. It will just take some time getting used to that,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fact Woods has officially switched balls could be a boost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, which only has about one per cent of the ball market share.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake,'' Bob Wood, president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf, said when Woods first used the ball in Germany.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was not immediately clear how the announcement would affect ongoing negotiations with Woods for a new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Mike Kelly said if Woods did use the ball, his original five-year contract likely would be amended.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Golf World Business reported that Woods' camp was looking over two proposals from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - one in which he used the ball.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 High-tech visas
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON - High-tech companies, desperate for workers amid a booming economy, want to hire more foreigners and are pushing Congress to expand an immigration program that will let them do just that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Congress temporarily expanded the program in 1998, increasing the number of six-year visas from 65,000 to 115,000 per year. But that hasn't satisfied the high-tech industry's appetite for skilled workers with college degrees. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle, reacting to the industry's growing clout, are developing legislation that would respond to that desire, despite criticism from labor, which contends the foreign workers are unneeded and underpaid at the high-tech jobs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Losing risky loans
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON - Some lawmakers warned Tuesday that tightening rules for banks that make many risky loans to people with poor credit histories could hurt low-income and minority neighborhoods that depend on such loans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Federal regulators made the proposal because of concerns about recent bank failures. Two big bank failures - of First National Bank of Keystone, based in Keystone, W.Va., and BestBank of Boulder, Colo. - involved fraud and cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more than $1 billion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures last year, which occurred amid a booming economy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Swoosh: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stock falls
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BEAVERTON, Ore. - Shares of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fell nearly 19 percent Tuesday after the athletic shoe maker said it will not meet earnings expectations for fiscal 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it still expects its earnings per share to grow 20 percent despite a shakeout in the U.S. retail industry. Nevertheless, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  president Tom Clarke said that annual earnings per share could fall below the current estimates of $2.08 by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Excluding a restructuring charge, Beaverton-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  earned $1.66 per share in fiscal 1999, which ended May 31. A 20 percent increase would mean earnings of about $1.99 a share.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the news, investors sent the stock down $8. 371/2 to $36.871/2 - a 52-week low - at 3:30 p.m. CST on the New York Stock Exchange.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clarke said many of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  retail partners in the U.S. have experienced a slump in footwear sales, causing them to close many of their stores.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some things are true even though Phil Knight, the chairman of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believes them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Knight recently made news by suddenly withdrawing a contemplated $30 million gift to the University of Oregon after the university balked at joining a coalition -- the Fair Labor Association (F.L.A.) -- that was formed by human rights groups, colleges, the U.S. government and companies such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to alleviate global sweatshop conditions. Oregon opted to join an alternative group being pushed on college campuses, the Worker Rights Consortium (W.R.C.), which also plans to combat sweatshops, but refuses to cooperate with any companies, such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The natural assumption is that Mr. Knight is wrong. The truth is, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a shameful past when it comes to tolerating sweatshops. But on the question of how best to remedy those conditions in the future -- which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has now agreed to do -- Mr. Knight is dead right and Oregon wrong: The best way to create global governance -- over issues from sweatshops to the environment -- when there is no global government is to build coalitions, in which enlightened companies, consumers and social activists work together to forge their own rules and enforcement mechanisms. That's what the F.L.A. represents and it's what the W.R.C. doesn't.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We've heard plenty this year about the downsides of globalization. The question is what to do about it. The more radical protesters, such as the W.R.C., want to trash multinationals and get the World Trade Organization to set rules for workers and the environment, not just for trade. And what practical effect have the protesters had so far? Zero.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So what to do? Well, it comes down to this: Do you want a make a point or do you want to make a difference? The F.L.A. was formed to make a difference. The W.R.C. was formed to make a point.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The F.L.A. was founded four years ago, and it now includes the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the National Council of Churches, the International Labor Rights Fund, 135 universities and major apparel companies such as Liz Claiborne, Levi Strauss, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reebok and Adidas. After long talks, this diverse group agreed on a nine-point code for any apparel factory anywhere in the world -- including rules against forced labor and child labor, as well as freedom of association, minimum wages, maximum working hours, lighting, bathrooms and safety. They also agreed on a system of independent monitoring, surprise inspections and follow-ups, which is now being tested in five developing countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Companies whose factories comply will be able to sew an "F.L.A." label into their clothing, and the 135 universities have agreed that their logos will go only on F.L.A.-made products. Global brands can't afford any longer to be associated with sweatshops, and the F.L.A. creates a credible system for empowering consumers to punish dirty companies and reward improving ones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The W.R.C., by contrast, is backed by protectionist U.S. unions, such as Unite, that don't want any system that would give a stamp of approval to any production outside the U.S. That's one reason the W.R.C. won't work with companies. But that means the W.R.C. has no way of consistently monitoring factories or following up remedies, and it is only focused on clothing sold on college campuses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's good that there's a W.R.C. out there noisily protesting sweatshops and embarrassing companies. But the W.R.C. is not a substitute for the F.L.A., which has a comprehensive strategy for upgrading the whole apparel industry. It's a pity that some cowardly college presidents -- intimidated by a few vocal and often uninformed students -- have quit the F.L.A. in favor of the W.R.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you want to improve people's lives in the absence of a global government, you need to align the economic interests of the better global companies with the social interests of the least advantaged people," said Sam Brown, the 1960's antiwar activist, former U.S. ambassador and now director of the F.L.A. "We need to make these companies our allies, not our opponents. We won't change the world overnight. But it is foolish to dismiss the F.L.A. because it does not go far enough or fast enough. The issue is how to get from here to there, and the F.L.A. has a real strategy for harnessing U.S. consumer power to change the lives and working conditions of real people."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AN orthopedic surgeon is suing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for GBP 6million after tripping over a lace on her trainers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dr Deborah Faryniarz says she suffered permanent injuries to her wrist when she fell while jogging. She says the design of the footwear, Certitude Cross trainers costing GBP 62, was to blame. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Pregnant with her first child at the time, she says the injury to her right wrist came only days before she was due to begin performing wrist operations. She claims she now needs help while carrying out surgery including getting other medical staff to twist screws into bones. In documents filed in the US District Court in Manhattan, the New York doctor said she was wearing the Certitude Cross trainers when her right lace hooked around the distinctive leather heel tab of the left shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She was due to begin performing wrist operations where she worked "but she ended up with her supervising professor also treating her," said her lawyer James Kreindler. He added, however, that her child was born healthy despite the fall in April last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since the injury, he said, Dr Faryniarz had managed to continue to perform operations and other work but only with the help of fellow doctors and nurses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is alleged that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was negligent for "carelessly designing, manufacturing, assembling, inspecting, testing and distributing" the trainers. The crux of the lawsuit, said Mr Kreindler, was that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  allegedly knew their product was hazardous but failed to fix the flaws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The lawsuit claims the fall was caused by a leather tab which rises about an inch and a half from the back of the shoe and is used to pull it onto the foot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On Certitude Cross trainers, it's claimed, the tab is larger and more rigid than on other designs, making it easier for the shoelace to catch on it. Mr Kreindler said that as a result of tripping, Dr Faryniarz suffered "permanent physical disfigurement and disabilities with far reaching effects on all aspects of her personal and professional life".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He added: "Ms Faryniarz also suffered great pain, suffering and mental anguish. She is still trying to be a surgeon but is uncertain what her future will be."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Cheryl McCants, a spokeswoman for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Beaverton, Oregon, said the company was not ready to comment.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the world's leading maker and marketer of athletic shoes with a GBP 5billion turnover and profits of GBP 330million last year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has come under fire for using Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in a TV commercial that features the word "sorry" 15 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman plays only a minor role in the commercial, but the timing of its release has stung Aboriginal activists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  National Sorry Day Committee chairman Audrey Kinnear claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to exploit the reconciliation process. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ms Kinnear said the continuous use of the word "sorry" trivialised the issue of whether the Federal Government should apologise to the stolen generation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "By using 'sorry' so many times and in so many ways, they are actually trivialising what 'sorry' stands for," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not Cathy's fault, but many Aboriginal people would be thinking that Cathy is guilty by association.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I thought that with all the publicity, nationally and internationally, they would have been a bit more sensitive about it," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has used 20, mainly Olympic, athletes who apologise to their family, friends and workmates for their obsession with sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, say "Sorry" in a light-hearted manner for being driven by success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Teenage runner Georgie Clarke apologises to her school friends for training instead of walking home with them and embattled spin bowler Shane Warne says sorry to Dennis, in an apparent reference to breaking Dennis Lillee's wicket-taking record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Freeman doesn't actually say "Sorry", but turns to the camera and says, "Can we talk about this later?" before running off into the distance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympics spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the timing of the "sorry" commercial was purely coincidental.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to show how athletes had to apologise to a lot of people they did not have time for during Olympic preparations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "While we understand there is some sensitivity and contention around the 'sorry' issue, it was more a behind-the-scenes look at athletes ... they have to say sorry to a lot of people," she said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  jerseys for a popular German soccer club are laced with a toxic
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  anti-bacterial chemical. German department stores weren't waiting
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  and were already pulling the shirts off shelves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The action followed a German television report that Borussia Dortmund's yellow-and-black jerseys contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for ships. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an ideal additive for sports shirts. But tests have shown the substance to cause mutations in marine snails and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Representatives of universities belonging to a new group set up by students to monitor apparel factories led a call yesterday to give companies a greater say in the group's work. The move came as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the footwear giant, moved once again against a university that had joined the monitoring group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meeting in a Chicago suburb, university officials said it was time for the monitoring group, the Workers Rights Consortium -- which is run by students, university officials and human rights and union leaders -- to begin a dialogue with apparel producers like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Over the last week, the consortium has come under heavy fire from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which accuses the group of being unfriendly to business and not giving companies a say in its affairs. Phil Knight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chairman and founder, even announced that he would not make a planned $30 million donation to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, because it had joined the consortium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Thursday, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  announced that it was ending negotiations to renew a six-year, multimillion-dollar licensing agreement with the University of Michigan because that institution had joined the consortium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Student anti-sweatshop groups persuaded nearly 50 universities to join the consortium as a way to monitor factories, in the United States and abroad, that make apparel under license for colleges. The consortium's goal is to make sure apparel carrying a university's name is not made in sweatshops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lawrence Mann, associate chancellor of the University of Illinois and a leader of the Workers Rights Consortium, said a major topic at yesterday's meeting was the universities' desire to give the industry a greater voice in the consortium. But Mr. Mann said his university and most others in the group opposed giving companies a seat on the board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The college and university group appears to be unanimous about the importance of engaging industry in the discussion," he said in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the Big 10 Conference in Park Ridge, Ill. "If that doesn't happen, the reality is the membership of the Workers Rights Consortium is just talking to itself."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Mann said the universities were pushing to give companies more say even before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acted against the universities of Oregon and Michigan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is not being motivated by anything \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has done," Mr. Mann said. "But the concern expressed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and other companies is a very legitimate question."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Peter Romer-Friedman, a University of Michigan junior who is one of the 3 students on the consortium's 12-member board, praised the universities' call to begin talking with companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The Workers Rights Consortium wants to engage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and other companies in a dialogue so we can work together to improve working conditions in all factories," Mr. Romer-Friedman said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  supports another monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association, which is backed by the White House and includes a dozen companies, 135 colleges and a handful of consumer and human rights groups. That association has created an elaborate plan to inspect factories around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But student anti-sweatshop groups insist that the Fair Labor Association is dominated by companies and will not carry out tough, independent inspections.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it had ended negotiations with Michigan because, in its view, the university had unilaterally changed terms of the agreement to comply with the requirements of the Workers Rights Consortium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Using unusually harsh language, the university said, "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has chosen again to strike out at universities committed to finding appropriate ways to safeguard and respect human rights."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's the most intriguing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tournament of Champions in its three-year
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 history that tips off Monday in Chicago and Evanston, Ill.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why the intrigue? Simply, the 32-team girls basketball tournament,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 which is split into two divisions, features 13 entries in USA
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 TODAY's Super 25 rankings. The eventual champion of the tournament's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Red Division, considered the elite flight, can make a strong claim
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for the nation's top ranking.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fueling the tournament's magnitude is Tuesday's loss by Highlands
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Ranch (Colo.), the top-ranked team. Preseason No. 1 Ben Davis
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of Indianapolis lost last week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I think that fact makes the tournament much more exciting for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 people to watch," says Mountain View (Orem, Utah) coach Dave
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Houle, whose No. 11-ranked team plays Bellevue (Wash.). "Hey,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 this is our one glimmer of hope to show that Utah teams play big-time
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 basketball. Somebody's going to leave the tournament 4-0 and another
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 0-4."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other Red Division matchups are: Narbonne (Harbor City, Calif.)-Hart
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 County (Munfordville, Ky); North Atlanta (Ga.)-Bullis School (Potomac,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Md.); South Sioux City (Neb.)-Mount Vernon (Alexandria, Va.);
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Hanford (Calif.)-John Marshall (Chicago); Riverdale Baptist (Upper
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Marlboro, Md.)-Germantown Academy (Fort Washington, Pa.); and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Berkeley (Calif.)-Miami Edison.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The tournaments will be played at DePaul University's Athletic
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Center and Northwestern's Welsh-Ryan Arena. The Red Division title
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 game is Thursday afternoon at Welsh-Ryan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The tournament makes its inaugural appearance in the Midwest after
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 a run in Santa Barbara, Calif.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you want to be the best, you must play the best," Narbonne
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 coach James Anderson said. "We feel that our program is top five
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 every year. This tournament prepares us for our state tournament."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the Blue Division, there are two key first round contests involving
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 USA TODAY Regional teams: Brea Olinda (Brea, Calif.)-Mountain
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Pointe of Phoenix, 10th in the West Regional rankings; and Whitney
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Young (Chicago)-Briarcrest Christian, seventh in the South Region.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Support group: DeMatha Catholic (Hyattsville, Md.) players
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 shaved their heads before a game this week in a show of support
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for boys coach Morgan Wootten's 13-year-old grandson, Stephen
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Paul, who has Hodgkin's Disease and is undergoing chemotherapy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I heard a rumor they might do that," said Wootten, whose team
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is ranked fifth by USA TODAY. "Then, boom, I saw it. It really
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 chokes you up."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wootten said his grandson, who knows several of the DeMatha players
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 from attending his camp, thought the action "was awesome."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  OF COURSE our Olympic competition team uniforms have gone the green and gold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Let's face it, recognition of our sporting prowess wouldn't be the same if we didn't see that ghastly colour combo take to the podium to accept the golds. Or silver. Or bronze. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But this time, instead of jeering our usual, nauseating sports colour alliance, we should be cheering them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The collection is slick, polished and in tune with the fusion of sport and style.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At yesterday's "reveal" of the gear our Olympians and Paralympians hope will help them to win gold, the unveiling took on serious fashion show proportions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Following a lead thrust onto the fashion scene a few seasons ago -- that of "techno-charging" every piece in your wardrobe -- the same vibe was felt in the Australian uniforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With the help (the entire design expertise in fact) of American mega-brand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , our uniforms blend cutting-edge fabric development and technically advanced designs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Of course, the choice of a US brand to furnish our athletes will ruffle a few (and totally unsuitable) local fashion feathers, but get with it guys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The globalisation of the Olympics is complete -- and the all-too-familiar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "swoosh" is a welcome global brand to outfit our notable sporting names.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Where it leaves the athletes with "other" sponsors will no doubt be another sticking point for our Olympic big guns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To "Australianise" the look of the uniform (after all, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is outfitting 21 other countries) each piece has a small Southern Cross and "waterfall"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 print design.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Simply, if going faster, higher and stronger is the objective, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have pulled out every trick in the design manual.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Steering away from that usual acid-tone of yellow and that garish shade of green, both colours have been toned back a few pegs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The yellow is softer and more buttercup-looking while the greens used are reminiscent of a schoolyard shade and not as tough on the eye.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Track and fielders are going to look like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey (they're a year ahead in fact) with full-body, "swift" suits hugging and embracing every muscle and curve. The suits will also include their heads and even their wrists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Our ball-sports athletes are in sleeveless, V-neck, "fashion now" T-shirts and beach volleyballers look like they could have come off the Baywatch set. But at least, our athletes have talent.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A state appeals court yesterday rejected a private citizen's attempt to hold athletic shoe giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Inc. liable for alleged misrepresentations of its labor practices in the Asian countries where its products are made, saying the company's public relations campaign on the subject shouldn't be judged by the same rules that govern advertisements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The First District Court of Appeal affirmed a San Francisco trial court's dismissal of Marc Kasky's lawsuit against the company on First Amendment grounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The press releases and public statements that were part of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  public relations campaign to address allegations of abusive working conditions were part of a public dialogue on a matter of public concern, and were thus protected speech, Justice Douglas E. Swager wrote for Div. One. The communications went beyond the realm of more narrowly protected commercial speech, he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exemplifies the perceived evils or benefits of labor practices associated with the processes of economic globalization," Swager said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Though participants in purely private labor disputes are entitled to certain First Amendment protections, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strong corporate image and widespread consumer market places its labor practices in the context of a broader debate about the social implications of employing low-cost foreign labor for manufacturing functions once performed by domestic workers," he said. "...Information about the labor practices at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overseas plants thus constitutes data relevant to a controversy of great public interest in our times."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a U.S.-based company, its factories are owned by South Korean and Taiwanese firms, and are located in those countries, China, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Court records show that 300,000 to 500,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  employees work to manufacture the shoes and other athletic gear in Asian countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -hired consulting firm reported favorable working conditions at the factories, other investigators reported poor health conditions, 11- to 12-hour work days, compulsory overtime, violation of minimum wage laws, exposure to dangerous levels of dust and toxic fumes, and employment of workers under the age of 16.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A series of newspaper and television reports in 1996 and 1997 put additional pressure on the company for its overseas labor record.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fought back with a costly public relations campaign that characterized the company as a leader in the fight to improve working conditions in the hot countries. Press releases detailed answers to the allegations, as did a series of letters to collegiate athletic directors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kasky sued over those releases and letters, alleging that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misrepresented the facts when it asserted that workers are not subjected to corporal punishment or sexual abuse, that the laws and regulations on wages, hours, health and safety were observed, that pay averaged double the minimum wage in Southeast Asia, and that employees receive free meals and health care and a "living wage."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and five of its corporate officers, who were also sued, filed demurrers, which were sustained without leave to amend by a San Francisco Superior Court judge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The courts began recognizing First Amendment protection for commercial speech in 1975 but allowed restraints when such speech was deemed false, deceptive or misleading.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Swager said the statements at issue for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were intended to promote a favorable corporate image and demand a different analysis than that applying to product advertisement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The press releases and letters at issue here cross the boundary between political and private decisionmaking," the justice said. "The citizen may want to translate personal discontent over \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  labor practices into political action or may merely wish to refrain from purchasing its products manufactured by undesired labor practices, just as he or she may wish to buy products with a union identification."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The analysis isn't changed by the fact that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an economic motivation in defending its corporate image from criticism, he said. The communications were still part of a "public dialogue on a matter of public concern within the core area of expression protected by the First Amendment," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The case is Kasky v. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Inc., A086142.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  When the Games of the 27th Olympiad open in Sydney this morning, don't expect a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advertising campaign about the worthless value of a silver medal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the Atlanta summer games four years ago, the US sportswear giant ran a controversial campaign with the slogan: "You don't win silver. You lose gold."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This unsportsmanlike message drew a sharp rebuke from the International Olympic Committee, which was upset to see one of its central tenets - that it is the taking part, not the winning, that counts most - so publicly rubbished. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has since become an official sponsor of the Sydney Games. But the committee is hoping for far wider changes in the commercialism surrounding the Olympics. Atlanta was something of a disaster for the Olympic movement's image. Stall-holders attempting to cash in on the games made the city seem more like a giant fleamarket than host to the world's premier sporting event. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Atlanta is actually a great city," says Mr Michael Payne, the International Olympic Committee's marketing director.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But what the world saw during the games was not reflective of a great city, or of the Olympic movement."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sydney's organisers have plans covering everything from revised agreements with sporting goods companies, such as Adidas and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to introducing new permits for buskers. Laws have been introduced limiting authorised food and merchandise vendors to six designated areas in the city. At the committee's insistence, the Australian government has introduced stringent restrictions on billboards around Olympic venues. All adverts bigger than five square metres must be approved by the government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That means we're not going to see any giant Reebok or Pepsi signs," says the Sydney organising committee. Neither Reebok nor Pepsi are official sponsors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The International Olympic Committee has also taken initiatives of its own. A code of conduct requires sporting goods companies to consult it about their marketing campaigns. In return, the companies can make use of individual athletes' images and endorsements during the Games - something they were previously denied because of IOC-approved contracts signed between athletes and their national teams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The result is a peculiar one. Advertising campaigns that might previously have been condemned as an unofficial "ambush" now have committee approval. For example, Adidas has launched a worldwide television campaign that boasts that Adidas-sponsored athletes will take part in 26 of the 28 sports in Sydney. Yet Adidas is not an International Olympic Committee sponsor. "We're just doing effective marketing," says Mr Rob Mills, the company's marketing director in Australia. "Our objective is not to be seen as an Olympic sponsor. Our objective is to make our brand stronger." Sydney's preparations have benefited from the fact that city, state and Games organisers are working under the guidance of a single committee. In Atlanta a quasi-corporate committee took charge of the Games but left preparations such as permits for street vendors to city officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Payne believes Sydney will serve as a model for other Olympic host cities. For the Olympic movement and its corporate sponsors, that may be so: but the impact on the host cities may prove a mixed blessing. Leaving aside the boost to tourism and other benefits, Sydney's Games will cost New South Wales taxpayers 140 million Australian dollars (E90 million). Atlanta, for all its tacky commercialism, made a modest profit for the city. Moreover, doubts remain as to whether the clean- up will succeed. Even with the restrictions put in place, there are many signs that other advertisers plan to gatecrash the party.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian airlines Qantas - which is not a sponsor - and Ansett - the "official airline" of the Sydney Games - this month tussled in court over Qantas advertising with an Olympic theme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Once the television cameras start rolling, unauthorised laser light shows and aircrafts etching logos in the skies over Bondi Beach are widely expected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I know there have been many non-sponsors in Sydney in the past two weeks organising what they're going to do," says Mr Martin Hirons, director at marketing research company Sweeney Research in Melbourne.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sheer pulling power of the Olympics means controlling advertising is one game the organisers can never win.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  OF COURSE our Olympic competition team uniforms have gone the green and gold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Let's face it, recognition of our sporting prowess wouldn't be the same if we didn't see that ghastly colour combo take to the podium to accept the golds. Or silver. Or bronze. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But this time, instead of jeering our usual, nauseating sports colour alliance, we should be cheering them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The collection is slick, polished and in tune with the fusion of sport and style.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At yesterday's "reveal" of the gear our Olympians and Paralympians hope will help them to win gold, the unveiling took on serious fashion show proportions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Following a lead thrust on to the fashion scene a few seasons ago -- that of "techno-charging" every piece in your wardrobe -- the same vibe was felt in the Australian uniforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With the help (the entire design expertise in fact) of American mega-brand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , our uniforms blend cutting-edge fabric development and technically advanced designs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Of course, the choice of a US brand to furnish our athletes will ruffle a few (and totally unsuitable) local fashion feathers, but get with it guys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The globalisation of the Olympics is complete -- and the all-too-familiar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "swoosh" is a welcome global brand to outfit our notable sporting names.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Where it leaves the athletes with "other" sponsors will no doubt be another sticking point for our Olympic big guns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To "Australianise" the look of the uniform (after all, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is outfitting 21 other countries) each piece has a small Southern Cross and "waterfall" print design.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Simply, if going faster, higher and stronger is the objective, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has pulled
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 out every trick in the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 design manual.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Steering away from that usual acid-tone of yellow and that garish shade of green, both colours have been toned back a few pegs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The yellow is softer and more buttercup-looking while the greens used are reminiscent of a schoolyard shade and not as tough on the eye.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Track and fielders are going to look like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey (they're a year ahead in fact) with full-body, "swift" suits hugging and embracing every muscle and curve. The suits will also include their heads and even their wrists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Our ball sports athletes are in sleeveless, V-neck, "fashion now" T-shirts and beach volleyballers look like they could have come off the Baywatch set. But at least, our athletes have talent.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How does shoe leather taste?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoe promises to help runners avoid dangers on the trail, but the athletic company ran into a snag of its own by insulting the disabled. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has withdrawn an advertisement for the new Air Dri-Goat trail running shoes that mocks people in wheelchairs. The ad claims the shoe will prevent a runner from slamming into a tree and "rendering me a drooling, misshapen, non-extreme-trail-running husk of my former self, forced to roam the Earth in a motorized wheelchair with my name embossed on one of those cute little license plates you get at carnivals or state fairs, fastened to the back." The ad appeared in several outdoor magazines this month. The company has apologized and killed the ad.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER United and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  confirmed the most lucrative deal in the history of sportswear last night. The 15-year contract, which starts when United's deal with Umbro ends after next season, will be worth around GBP 300million. Some United shareholders are upset at allegations that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  uses child labour - a practice decried in United's club charter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ENGLISH fans have petitioned the EC to keep the current transfer system - unless big clubs begin to dish out more TV money to the lower leagues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Football Supporters' Association wrote to European Commissioner Mario Monti, the man who could effectively scrap fees, urging him to compromise with leading clubs only if they share a prime source of income.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  WEST HAM UNITED manager Harry Redknapp believes England coach Sven Goran Eriksson should include John Barnes in his backroom staff.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'If Eriksson is looking for somebody with a real understanding of football I think John Barnes is his man,' said Redknapp of the former England star, who was sacked as Celtic chief coach last February.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SOUTHAMPTON captain Jason Dodd has signed a two-year extension on his contract to keep him at the club until June 2003.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dodd, 30, has been granted a testimonial after 11 years and more than 300 appearances. He said: 'I was out of contract in the summer and getting nervous, so it's pleasing they want me to stay.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  REAL MADRID'S Luis Figo has admitted he would like to play in the Premiership. The Portugual international, who is 28 today, signed for Real from Primera Liga rivals Barcelona for a world record GBP 37.5million. Figo has a six-year deal with Real, who reportedly inserted a GBP 100 million buyout clause in his contract.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  DUBLIN, Ohio: Tiger Woods will again have the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball in his bag when he defends his Memorial title at Muirfield Village starting today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods used the ball for the first time in competition while failing to retain his title in Hamburg last week, but refused to disclose when, or if, he would permanently switch from the Titleist ball he has used throughout his career. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With the US Open at Pebble Beach looming next month, Hal Sutton, the man who beat the world No. 1 down the stretch for the prestigious Players Championship, warned that Woods could face a period of adjustment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There will be an adjustment period, I don't care how good a player you are," said Sutton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "That ball will react differently than the ball he has been playing. It can be a very dramatic change to a golfer's life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger is going from a wound ball to a multi-covered one  . . .  and if that ball responds differently than you thought it should have, it aggravates you and you can't get your mind off that," Sutton said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods surrendered a final-round lead for the first time since 1996 when he lost to England's Lee Westwood last Sunday, but contended that he has no fears experimenting with the new ball.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fresh off his record-breaking summer of golf, Tiger Woods is  on the verge of signing a $ 100 million endorsement contract with  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed to be the richest in sports, The Associated Press  has learned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The money is coming in so fast that Woods, 24, is already  well on his way to becoming sports' first $ 1 billion man. Michael  Jordan currently earns $ 69 million a year, according to Forbes  magazine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods has made $ 8.3 million on the golf course alone this  year, and an estimated $ 47 million overall. His new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract  would earn him $ 20 million alone, up from the estimated $ 8 million  to $ 12 million \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has paid him annually since 1996. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, declined to discuss  specifics of the deal Thursday, only to say it is an 'outstanding  contract.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'We are within days of a signature,' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'It compensates Tiger not just for what he's done with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,  but what he has done for golf and sports.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods' previous contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was said to be $ 40 million  to $ 60 million over five years. He was used heavily in their  advertisements and established his own line of clothing and shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A source close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  anonymity, described it as the 'largest contract in sports  marketing history,' worth about $ 100 million over five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'There are so many different revenue streams,' the source  said. 'It's impossible to calculate what the end result will be.'
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president Bob Wood described the contract as  'pretty creative.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'It's not often you get a chance to work with somebody who's  the best in the world at what they do,' he said. 'Working with  Tiger Woods has created an incredible amount of positive energy  about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Wood also declined to discuss contract details, he did  say the amount was partly tied to sales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In just four years, he has won all four major championships,  becoming, at 24, the youngest player to do so. He set the scoring  record in each of them, and he has attracted a record number of TV  viewers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With three tournaments still to play, his nine victories this  year are the most in one PGA Tour season since 1950, and he is on  pace to shatter the season scoring average set by Byron Nelson in  1945.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In June, he gave \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a huge lift when he switched to the  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball. He went on to win the U.S. Open at Pebble  Beach by 15 strokes, the largest winning margin in the 140-year  history of major championship golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods also became the first player to finish a U.S. Open in  double figures below par, a 12-under 272. A month later, he won  the British Open at St. Andrews with a 19-under 269 - another  major championship record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last month, he became the first player in the stroke-play era  of the PGA Championship to win back-to-back titles, outlasting Bob  May in a three-hole playoff.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf president said its market share for balls has  increased from about 1 percent in April to nearly 4 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The switch to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball did not have a major impact on  contract negotiations, Wood said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also is considering a move  toward golf clubs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods devotes a substantial amount of time to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the  Beaverton, Ore., company has used him effectively in TV ads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Perhaps the most famous was not even planned. During a break  from a commercial of Woods hitting balls with dozens of hackers on  a range, he began bouncing a ball on his wedge - behind his back,  between his legs - before whacking it in midair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His father, Earl, said last week that Woods would do more for  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than Michael Jordan ever did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earlier this year, Woods signed an endorsement deal with  Buick worth $ 30 million over five years and carries its logo on  his bag. In all, Woods has endorsement contracts with 11 companies.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT took 16 years, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has found a way to put some spring in your step -- by putting the spring in your shoes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Rather than the bulky rubber polymer heels used in most running shoes, Shox contain four spring-like polyurethane foam columns that absorb much of the shock usually taken into ankles, heels and back -- shock absorbers for the feet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Each of the columns collapses like a spring then expands to propel the runner's foot upwards.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total purse on the PGA Tour in 1996, the year Tiger Woods turned pro, was $69.1 million U.S. It might not be too long before he makes that much in a year, on and off the course.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Once his new five-year contract with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. takes effect next August, Woods will bring in about $54 million each year from endorsement deals he has with 12 companies, according to this week's issue of Golf World.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The magazine cited a variety of sources familiar with the contracts, which range from the $100-million deal Woods signed Friday with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to a five-year, $10-million deal with the company that performed Lasik eye surgery on Woods a year ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the course, Woods already has earned close to $8.3 million this year, with three tournaments still to play. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He receives a reported $1-million appearance fee when he plays overseas, such as the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand, and he also plays the unofficial Grand Slam of Golf and his own Williams World Challenge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Woods grew up in a middle-class home, such riches are nothing new since he turned pro and signed a five-year, $40-million deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Since then, he has won 24 times on the PGA Tour, including the career Grand Slam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Money has never been important to Tiger,'' said his father, Earl Woods. ''If it was, Tiger would have about five times, or maybe seven times, as many endorsement dollars as he does have.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''He'd be a hell of a lot richer. Obviously, it would curtail his development and affect his performance.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Money hasn't done much to change Woods, who has raised the standards in golf. He became the first player since 1953 to win three straight majors, and already, at age 24, has enough tour victories to achieve a lifetime exemption.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Probably the single most thing I admire about Tiger Woods is he can sign a $100-million deal today and wake up tomorrow with the same desire to be the best in the world,'' Hal Sutton said Monday when told of the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Golf World, Woods' biggest deals after that with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are with Buick, EA Sports and Asahi Beverages, each worth about $30 million over five years. He also has a five-year deal with American Express that the magazine said was worth $26 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Perhaps the greatest example of Woods' endorsement power is the deal with TLC Laser Eye Centres, which he signed in February.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the first golfers to have the Lasik surgery were Fred Funk and former PGA champion Mark Brooks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mike Biggs of Gaylord Sports Entertainment, which represents Brooks, once said he approached the company with the idea of a ''TLC team'' on the PGA Tour. The players involved would not have had such a high profile as Woods, and the proposal was not nearly as lucrative.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We were told ... they had just turned a profit and could not justify spending endorsement money on a golfer,'' Biggs said. ''Six months later, we start hearing rumours about Tiger reaching a seven-figure deal with TLC.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods gives TLC nothing more than a testimonial about his experience with Lasik, and gets $2 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Where does the money go?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earl Woods said his son puts the money earned from tournaments into a fund to build a house in Orlando, Florida. Some of the endorsement money goes to the Tiger Woods Foundation, which was created to provide more minority participation in golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Many people want Tiger to design golf courses or take over joint-capital ventures,'' his father said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''He doesn't need inherited problems. Nothing comes between Tiger and what he is supposed to be doing.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AUSTRALIAN Olympic track athletes, including Cathy Freeman, will be able to wear super-hero-like, hooded full-body suits at the Sydney Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Swift Suit was unveiled in the US yesterday, with world 100m champion Marion Jones already describing it as "awesome".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Australian Olympic Committee has cleared the way for Australian athletes to wear the head-to-toe outfit produced by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the offical team uniform provider. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An AOC spokeswoman said all athletes could wear the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Swift Suit because it was not classified as technical equipment but apparel, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had not claimed it enhanced performance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  technical designers produced the skin-tight suit, which has a hood with mesh earholes, to improve a sprinter's aerodynamics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The suit is being pushed for sprinting events up to the 400m, in which Freeman is hoping to win gold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The bodysuit has five different fabric styles that sit around different muscle groups and are designed to help provide optimum temperatures for those muscles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The seams are all in the back of the suit, the front zipper is hidden and the sleeves extend to cover part of the hands -- all of which have been designed to reduce air-flow separation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Australian 100m champion Matt Shirvington's coach, Michael Khmel, said the star sprinter would be prepared to trial the suit if it was made available to him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, for adidas-sponsored Shirvington to wear his own sponsor's new bodysuit instead of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  version, he would have to apply to the AOC to have the adidas suit classed as technical equipment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ian Thorpe, who faced the same issue because he wanted to wear his adidas bodysuit instead of togs by official team-provider Speedo, successfully applied to the AOC to have his full bodysuit classed as technical equipment -- enabling all Australian Games swimmers to wear their preferred suit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Footwear is the only apparel worn by sprinters classed as "technical equipment", which means they can wear any brand of shoes they want but all other apparel must be team issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas marketing manager Rob Mills said yesterday that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit was vastly different to the adidas version, which helped a sprinter go faster by reducing muscle vibration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Adidas had previously produced a sprinting suit with a hood -- worn by sprint superstar Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 at the Seoul Olympics -- but discarded the idea, Mills said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A hooded adidas suit had been tested by Olympic champion Donovan Bailey two years ago but was dumped because the hood prevented sprinters seeing opponents during a race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Khmel said Shirvington would still consider wearing the hooded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  version if it helped him run faster. He added: "It doesn't hurt to try it, and if it does work he will wear it. It doesn't matter if it's adidas or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  All American athletes heading to Sydney are being offered the Swift Suit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unlike a Sept. 21 letter writer, I was neither stunned nor appalled by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad featuring the American runner Suzy Hamilton "sprinting away from a chain-saw-wielding maniac." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  I am always happy to see an amusing spoof of a silly movie genre, which is all that this ad is. Truth and reality rarely come together as one, especially in television advertising.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allegations that Tiger Woods does use the ball advertised as his playing companion has landed the sports goods giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a San Francisco court, accused of "unfair business practice".  A non-profit-making organisation, Public Remedies Inc, claims that the world's No 1 golfer does not play with the Precision Tour Accuracy ball but one that has "different composition and performance characteristics specially made for him and not available to the general public".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The row hasn't affected the form of Woods, who matched the course record at the Firestone South course with a second-round score of 61 before going on to pick up the NEC Invitational trophy, finishing 21-under for the tournament, and 11 shots clear of his nearest rival, Philip Price.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 US champion Maurice Greene's famous golden shoe could be worth between $US50,000 and $US100,000 to Wagga jeweller Ben Harper but only if he sells it soon. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 20yearold Mr Harper caught the shoe after Greene flung it into the crowd at the Olympic stadium on Saturday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The managing director of Lawsons, Mr James Badgery, said if the shoe was sold on eBay, the online auction site, it could make Mr Harper a small fortune by attracting wealthy American buyers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's unlikely to increase in value it has its value now," Mr Badgery said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a 100 metre gold medal shoe. The shoe of the Sydney 2000 Olympics."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Badgery said Lawsons had not been contacted by prospective buyers, in part because Mr Harper had said he would keep it forever.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Sydney auction house was helping to oversee Olympic Aid online, a fundraiser selling Games sporting memorabilia to help underprivileged children in Australia and overseas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The signed swimsuit of 4x200m freestyle relay gold medallist Bill Kirby had received 36 bids, the highest at $26,100.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And swimming goggles belonging to the man who swam alone in a 100m freestyle qualifying heat, Equatorial Guinea's Eric Moussambani, had received 68 bids, the highest $3,077. Obtaining Olympic memorabilia is not only a passion of those out to make a quick dollar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 JeanFrancois Pahud would like to get his hands on the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard's Olympic security pass.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As the curator of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, he and his sixmember team are in Sydney collecting Games memorabilia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They too would like one of Greene's running shoes, but say that is unlikely before the relay final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Pahud said the museum was not only interested in gold medal winners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Moussambani's swim suit had made it into the collection.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Team books, The Sydney Morning Herald, medallists' autographs, photos of the finish in track and field competitions with the signature of the gold medallist, all are being collected," Mr Pahud said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT took 16 years, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has found a way to put spring in our step -- by putting the spring in our shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shox, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest range of athletic shoes, is also its most technologically advanced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Replacing the typically bulky, rubber polymer heels used in most running shoes are four spring-like polyurethane foam columns that absorb much of the shock usually taken in ankles, heels and back. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Each of the columns collapses like a spring on impact with the ground then expands to its original height, helping to propel the runner's foot upwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The shoes absorb the shock of impact and deflect it through the shock columns in the shoe as your heel comes off the ground," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  product manager Paul Crough said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Springs in shoes is hardly a new idea. The United States Patents and Trademarks Office has shelves lined with prototypes dating back almost a century.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researchers were inspired to work on Shox when the company heard about Harvard University's spring-loaded racing track, which was helping runners to markedly faster times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The track -- designed by Tom McMahon, a young professor of biology and applied mechanics -- contained layers of calibrated plywood and polyurethane which created an unusual springiness that reduced both running times and injuries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hired Prof. McMahon to apply the same principals to running shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bruce Kilgore, now \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  director of advanced research, took up the project when his colleague returned to Harvard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The project was put on hold several times over the next decade as the company concentrated on its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Air range.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Mr Kilgore and his team tried all sorts of materials from piano hinges to cantilevers (picture a V-shaped bracket on its side). They even tried inserting steel springs into the heel, but that proved a tad painful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In 1990, they found a viable model -- the four booster thrusters on space shuttles -- and began working on the four-column model that has been incorporated into Shox sneakers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The shoes will not be released until December 6, so their comfort is still in question. However, the athletic shoe review website www.kicksology.net advises users need to break the shoes in before they begin to provide any benefit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "After my first day of wear, I was ready to give Shox a negative review," Prof. K said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A senior reviewer at Kicksology, he was talking about BB4, the dedicated basketball shoe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Not since my days of playing for hours at a time on asphalt in a pair of Cons (Converse shoes) had I felt so much pain in my feet and shins," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Prof. K consulted the experts at www.niketalk.com, a site devoted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes. They suggested he needed to wear the shoes more than twice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Without the pain, I began to appreciate the other positives about the BB4s, the most impressive being the stability," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Shox BB4 is perhaps the ultimate defensive players' shoe because it allows for an incredible level of agility in all directions."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shox will be available as runners (R4), cross-trainers (XT4) and basketball boots (BB4). They will cost between $250 and $260.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TIGER WOODS is not just the world's best golfer; he's also the world's best conglomerate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even before his new five-year, $85 million \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contract that will more than double his current five-year, $40 million \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal, which expires next September, his 11 endorsement contracts were 2 more than his 9 tournament victories this year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If you add up those 11 contracts that his International Management Group gurus have negotiated, his endorsement income this year will surpass $50 million, plus at least $12 million this year in worldwide prize money and appearance fees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His endorsement total of more than $50 million will be significantly more than Michael Jordan's reported endorsement high of $35 million a year when he was soaring through National Basketball Association arenas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And for all the millions that those 11 companies are paying the 24-year-old Woods as their ambassador, he's a bargain. He's now what Pele, Muhammad Ali and Jordan were in other years -- the most recognizable sports figure on the planet. And when it's time to renegotiate the contracts, all those companies will find, as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did, that he'll be more expensive next time. Much more expensive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition to his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal, he has contracts with American Express, Buick, Wheaties, Rolex, Titleist golf equipment, Golf Digest magazine, Electronic Arts video games, TLC Laser Eye Centers, CBS SportsLine and Asahi coffee in Japan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a way, those 11 contracts represent a career grand slam in endorsements that matches the career Grand Slam in golf that he completed this year by adding the United States Open and the British Open to his 1997 Masters and 1999 Professional Golfers Association victory while winning seven other tournaments, including a second P.G.A. title.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there's a controversial connection to his contracts with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Titleist that developed from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial in which he keeps bouncing a golf ball on a club, then hits the ball with the club as if with a fungo bat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That commercial developed accidentally during the shooting of another \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commercial when Woods, between takes, was noticed bouncing a golf ball on a club just for the fun of it. With the cameras rolling, Woods did it on the fourth take.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the time, Titleist, which was paying Woods to play and endorse its golf ball and clubs, objected because the commercial made it appear that he was using a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball. In his renegotiated Titleist contract, he is still being paid to use their clubs, but Titleist is not allowed to use his name or likeness in its advertising.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  meanwhile, was developing the golf ball that Woods has used since May -- the ball with a reported harder inner core than that in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball being sold in golf shops, the ball that he hits so far that some people were wondering if maybe it was a "hot" ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a legal ball," said Dick Rugge, the senior technical director at the United States Golf Association in Far Hills, N.J., where clubs and balls are subjected to tests for distance, initial velocity, diameter, weight and symmetry. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  submitted 14 different versions of that ball to us last December. The one that Tiger liked and uses, other pros tried that particular ball too, but chose not to use it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All golf balls may look identical, but they vary with the hardness of the material, the thickness of the cover, the size of the core.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Tiger isn't winning all these tournaments because of that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ball," Rugge said. "He's winning because he's a different breed of cat."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Until another golfer rises to that different cat's level, about the only threat to Woods is Woods himself. He's so skilled and so strong, he doesn't hesitate to hit a ball from a lie that could be hazardous to his health, especially the health of his hands and wrists. He's hit the ball off small rocks. He's hit the ball from so close behind a tree, his follow-through jammed the clubhead into the trunk. At the Buick Open the week before the recent P.G.A. Championship, he hit a ball off a tree root and winced from the pain in his hand and wrist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was just a stinger," he said later. "I hit the root and it hurt quite a bit initially, then as I was walking to my ball, it all went away. But I took out that root pretty good."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If he persists in risking his hands and wrist, sooner or later a root or a rock is going to be stronger than even Tiger Woods is. Sooner or later, a root or a rock could take him out pretty good, too; out of the PGA Tour until that injury heals. That could disrupt the dominance of both the world's best golfer and the world's best conglomerate.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I'm not headed for the LPGA Tour. I'm not even sure how many  strokes I've shaved off my game. But after a series of lessons at  the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Learning Center, I am sure that I am hitting the ball  consistently better. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a series of four 11/2-hour lessons, called 'Tee It Up 1,'  Geoff Greig, senior director of instruction at Park Hill Golf  Course, took five of us through hitting with irons and woods,  chipping and putting, and playing out of the sand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The series was aimed at beginners with minimal golf knowledge.  But even as the most experienced golfer in the group (playing  casually for about 11/2 years), I learned a few details about the  game. For example, if you are in a bunker or water hazard, you are  penalized if you touch the ground with your club before striking  the ball.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But beginners, never fear. Those rules need not apply for now.  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Learning Center encourages beginners to 'adjust' the  rules to make the game more enjoyable. Park Hill, for example, has  set up special forward tees to decrease the yardage of the course  for beginners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Learning Center hopes if new golfers can come out and  enjoy playing, they'll keep coming back.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Tee It Up program offers students plenty of opportunities to  do just that. The $ 149 package includes six hours of instruction,  five rounds of golf, clinics with discounted golf and other  bonuses. They are planning tournaments for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Learning Center  participants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The center tries to make it easy to learn the game - from  opportunities to play to the instruction itself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead of telling students to hold the club this way and stand  that way, Grieg explained how the elements of a golf swing work:  how the club should hit the ball and how changing the arc of the  swing or shifting your weight impact the relationship between the  ball and club.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sounds complicated for a beginner class? Not really. I found it  much more beneficial to understand what I was doing with my swing  and how I could adjust than merely imitating an action I was shown.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I've hit the golf course twice since the lessons and found I was  able to apply what I had learned, and my game has improved. I'll  be practicing this summer, but golf being what it is, look for me  in Tee It Up 2 next summer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For more information on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Learning Center at Park Hill,  call 1-877-312-GOLF or check out www.nikegolflearning.com.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although technology has transformed the running shoe into a complex piece of fitness equipment, Oregon-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has simplified the summer sneaker. Billed as the T-shirt for your feet, its new unisex Air Presto comes in sizes XXS to XL. Each size spans about three traditional sizes.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Inspired by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  classics such as the 1985 Air Sock Racer and Trainer and the Air Harache, company designers experimented with taking out the material at the side of the shoe (the V-notch), below the runner's ankle, and found it relieved tension and allowed the shoe to expand. The result is a super-soft sneaker with variable fit possibilities, which looks like a sock within a sandal. The lightweight design, in seven colour combinations including white/poppy, white/Atlantic blue and grey/orange blaze, hits store shelves this month. Although they can be worn for daily training, at $129.95, they might just become the newest fitness-minded fashion accessory.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pepe Sanchez, hoping to use this week's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Desert Classic in Phoenix to solidify his NBA draft standing, sprained his right ankle Tuesday night during the first practice of the week-long showcase for top college seniors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The X-rays yesterday showed no fracture, but the point guard, who just completed his Temple career, is out of the three-day tournament. He plans to fly back to Philadelphia tomorrow afternoon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was down, kind of not believing what happened, the first practice," said George Severini, the soccer coach at Haverford High School and a close friend who talked to Sanchez late Tuesday night. "He said he went for a rebound, came down, didn't place it properly. They had been practicing for awhile. It was like a game. He was feeling very comfortable about himself, very much in command of himself and what he was doing. He was feeling very confident that he could do pretty well."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sanchez knew that this week's games were his chance to show the NBA that he is capable of being a man-to-man defender and that he can could run a team in a different style than that employed by the Owls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead, teams will be asking about his ankle, the same one he injured in the preseason and then re-injured in the season opener, forcing him to miss eight games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was during those games that those watching Temple struggle learned how valuable Sanchez was to the Owls. Now, if the ankle is up to it, Sanchez will have to consider playing in June's NBA pre-draft camp in Chicago. That is the last competitive showcase for NBA scouts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PEBBLE BEACH Matt Gogel proved he could win on the Buy.com Tour, capturing a career record-tying six titles during the past four years. Now he's out to prove another point, that he can beat the world's best golfers on the PGA Tour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After two rounds of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Gogel is in title contention. He owned sole possession of third place at 7-under par 137, just four shots behind leader Vijay Singh and three behind Notah Begay III. Gogel shot a second-round 68 on Saturday at Poppy Hills, a round that included an eagle at the par-4 first hole. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gogel earned his PGA Tour card by finishing seventh on the former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour's money list last year. Two weeks ago he was in the final group in the final round of the Bob Hope Classic. But he shot 71 and settled for a tie for seventh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I felt good, but maybe I was tight and tentative with my putter," Gogel said of his final round at the Hope.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This time Gogel plans to stay relaxed and vows to concentrate on the shot at hand, not the ultimate result.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're only halfway through this tournament," Gogel said. "There's a lot of golf left. I have to stay patient. There's a long way to go to be in that final group."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hot times
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Paul Azinger had the ultimate good news, bad news round at Poppy Hills. Starting on the back nine, he shot 40 for his first nine holes. He followed with a 7-under 29 on the front, breaking the course front-nine record by three shots. Azinger had an eagle at the par-4 fifth and five birdies. For the tournament, he was at 1-over 145.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weather watch
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Weather Channel's forecast for today's scheduled third round calls for patchy morning fog but no rain, with a high temperature of 66 and wind from the southwest at 10-20 mph. Increasing clouds are expected by the afternoon with rain possible tonight and into Monday. "It will be basically dry during play (today). So we should get that third round in," meteorologist Mike McClellan said. "There will be another cold front coming in. At this point it doesn't look like anything real heavy. We'll have to watch it real close."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keith Clearwater, a former Northgate High School golfer, shot a second-round 75 at Pebble Beach, leaving him at 2 over par for the tournament and tied for 67th. Ex-Stanford and Amador Valley High School golfer Joel Kribel was tied for 96th at 4 over after shooting a 74 at Poppy Hills. Campolindo High graduate Dave Wilcox was in 179th place at 24 over. He shot a 78 at Spyglass Hill.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brad Fabel and David Morland had hole-in-ones Saturday. Fabel aced the 15th hole at Spyglass Hill. Morland had his hole-in-one at Pebble Beach's fifth hole. ... For the eighth straight year, the tournament was played under lift-clean-and-place rules because of rainy weather. ... Perry Moss tied a Spyglass Hill back-nine record Friday when he fired a 31. That was 10 shots better than he shot on his front nine.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been accused of exploiting Aboriginal sprint star Cathy Freeman and the nation's reconciliation debate in an ad featuring athletes saying sorry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 National Sorry Day Committee co-chair Audrey Kinnear said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was heartlessly and shamelessly trivialising the nation's "Sorry" campaign with its latest ad "No Apologies".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said her committee would call on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to withdraw the ad. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The advertisement features 20 athletes looking at the camera as the word "sorry" appears on screen, with Aboriginal sprinter Freeman mouthing the words: "Can we talk about this later?"
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday said its "No Apologies" advertising campaign -- the first stage of the company's Olympic campaign -- was in no way related to the reconciliation debate or Prime Minister John Howard's refusal to apologise to the stolen generation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Ms Kinnear said the ad was an irresponsible and cruel ploy which undermined Freeman's credibility when she could not afford further controversy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nick Bideau, Freeman's former coach and business manager, is suing the high-profile athlete, claiming she breached her contract with his management company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Peter Jess, a fellow director of the company set up in May 1996 to promote Freeman and other elite Australian athletes, is also suing the 27-year-old star.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want them to remove it from air, not only for us but also for Cathy because Cathy really can't afford to get involved in any more controversy and they might not realise it but it may have an impact on Cathy's credibility," said Ms Kinnear, who is a member of the Stolen Generation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's insensitive of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use her that way because it's going to hurt our people . . . the use of the word 'sorry', so many times, straight after the reconciliation walk in Sydney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They're using her but also they are capitalising on the word we want to hear from governments and other Australians to right the wrongs of past history."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman's spokesman Richard Amos said he was waiting to talk to the sprint star and could not comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Kinnear said the Sorry Day Committee would probably make an official statement asking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to withdraw the ad for Cathy's sake and that of other indigenous Australians.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can't understand how intelligent people could not contemplate how this would impact on us," Ms Kinnear said. "It's devastating."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing director Brent Scrimshaw denied the company was commenting on or capitalising on the reconciliation debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This advertisement features 20 athletes -- all of whom have to make choices in order to become the best they can be," Mr Scrimshaw said.

(Cathy's) reference to 'Can we talk about this later?' illustrates that all she wants to do is focus on running -- she's too busy to stop and talk. It's a sacrifice."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A day after the Paralympic Games closed, Australia was in uproar over an advertisement for the sportswear company \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  describing disabled people as "drooling, misshapen husks". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The advertisement for the "Air Dri-Goat" running shoe appears in several American magazines available in Australia. A paragraph reads: "How can a trail running shoe . . . help me avoid compressing my spinal cord into a Slinky on the side of some unsuspecting conifer, thereby rendering me a drooling misshapen . . . husk of my former self, forced to roam the earth in a motorised wheelchair".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After being bombarded by e-mail complaints, the company apologised on its internet site and said it would withdraw the advertisement.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NBC HAS done one of its Olympics sponsors, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc., a major favor. The network killed a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ad that in our view was about as tasteless, exploitative and inappropriate as an ad can be. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vice president said the ad was supposed to be funny--"ironic"--and that NBC had "preapproved" it, suggesting the network then caved in the face of what were apparently numerous complaints. Sometimes cave-ins are wise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ad had no redeeming features. To sell tennis shoes, it converted a subject that for many women is a source of genuine fear--that they will encounter violence against which they can't defend themselves--into a macabre joke. The ad was entitled Horror. A chainsaw-wielding man in a hockey mask breaks in on a young woman in a remote cabin. She screams and runs; he chases her but can't keep up; she escapes as he is shown panting for breath. A question flashes on the screen: "Why Sport?," followed by the answer: "You'll live longer." What a laugh. Another spoof on horror shows, deftly done. It's even scary. Who could possibly object?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We're sure the ad was tested and found effective among whatever group the company was trying to reach. But it's not a funny subject, surely not to women who have been or are frightened of becoming victims; nor is it a fit subject for children, millions of whom are watching the games. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can find a better way to sell its products.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis Love III turned down an offer from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf to play a ball similar to the one used by Tiger Woods, agreeing yesterday to a multi-year contract extension with Acushnet Co. to stick with Titleist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our entire company is ecstatic that Davis will remain part of the Acushnet Co. family for many years to come," chairman and CEO Wally Uihlein said in a statement. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He declined to disclose terms of the deal, only that Love will continue playing Titleist clubs and balls, and wear gloves and shoes by FootJoy, another Acushnet brand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When someone is throwing piles of money at you, you've got to take a look," Love said. "It was awfully tempting. We're talking a lot of money . . . more than what you're used to. In the end, I wanted to be with Titleist."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Quinn drew level with Frank Stapleton's tally with a towering header from Mark Kennedy's 68th-minute free-kick.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  You can understand the panic - after just a couple of decades waiting for a trainer that has anything to do fashion, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has caused chaos among addicts by going all Bottega Veneta with its limited edition Woven range. These shoes - basically baskets for the feet, hand-woven in elastic - have, if you believe reports, caused queues and catfights this last week at branches of Office affiliates Offspring and Poste among those desperate to part with pounds 150 for something that looks like a criss-crossed bandage. The trainers, limited to 200 pairs per never-to-be-repeated colour worldwide, are available in two editions - brown/khaki or black and red. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Offspring is running low on stock, with only very small sizes left, and hoping for another batch within the month. Browns Focus has just taken delivery of stock which should, on optimistic estimates, last to the end of the week. And insiders are already aware that Pauric Sweeney's cult Hoxton boutique will stock the Woven when it opens in December. This frenzy isn't limited to the high street, presumably helped by the rumour that the Woven originated in the Comme des Garcons design studio. On e-bay, bidding stands at Dollars 699 for a pair in blue with grape and cream tones, a sale that is about to make its anonymous owner very happy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But while a limited-edition piece from a high-fashion house can be timeless, trend trainers scream for immediate attention, and fade in covetability the second you see someone else in them. Meanwhile, the scrabble to get hold of the item stops shoppers from thinking about whether the product suits them or not.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So, while the BV weave looks sexy and second-hand made into bodices or bags, the cocoon shape of the Woven is not going to make any foot appear slender and elegant. Do you want to look as if you're in an orthopaedic shoe? No? Then think again about the Woven.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Manchester United have agreed a world record $ 450m, 15-year kit deal with sportswear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  The sponsorship easily beats \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  kit deal with the Brazilian Football Federation. That 10-year agreement is worth about $ 105m, and covers all the country's national teams, including junior and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a kit deal of a different kind the No 10 shirt worn by Sir Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final -- won by England, for those who can't remember -- made football history for the second time last week when it was sold at auction for $ 138,000.  A football-mad British -- well, we're almost certain he's English collector bid by telephone from Sydney, where he was on holiday during the Olympics.  The price for the shirt in which Hurst scored a hat-trick more than doubles the previous record of $ 66,000 for a shirt worn by the late Bobby Moore on that historic day.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  SPORTSWEAR maker \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been accused of exploiting Aboriginal sprint star Cathy Freeman and the nation's reconciliation debate in an ad featuring athletes saying sorry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman plays only a minor role in the ad, but the timing of its release has stung Aboriginal activists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 National Sorry Day Committee co-chairwoman Audrey Kinnear said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was "heartlessly and shamelessly" trivialising the nation's "sorry" campaign with its latest slogan "No apologies". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Kinnear said her committee would call on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to withdraw the ad.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The advertisement features 20 athletes looking at the camera as the word "sorry" appears on-screen, with Freeman saying, "Can we talk about this later?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most athletes, including runner Steve Moneghetti and footballer James Hird, say sorry in a light-hearted manner for being driven by success.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympics spokeswoman Megan Ryan said the timing of the "No apologies" commercial was purely coincidental.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Ryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was trying to show how athletes had to apologise to a lot of people they did not have time for during Olympic preparations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While we understand that there is some sensitivity and contention around the 'sorry' issue, it was a more behind-the-scenes look at athletes who make no apologies for the fact they have to say sorry to a lot of people," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sorry is a word used by people everyday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is a coincidence that the whole reconciliation issue has come up here."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Ryan said the insight into Freeman was more about the fact that everybody wanted "a piece of her" in the lead-up to the Sydney Games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not in reference to the reconciliation issue," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Ms Kinnear said the ad was an irresponsible and cruel ploy which undermined Freeman's credibility when she could not afford further controversy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nick Bideau, Freeman's former coach and business manager, is suing the high-profile athlete, claiming she breached her contract with his management company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's insensitive of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use her that way because it's going to hurt our people . . . the use of the word 'sorry', so many times, straight after the reconciliation walk in Sydney," Ms Kinnear said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They're using her, but also they are capitalising on the word we want to hear from governments and other Australians to right the wrongs of past history."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Freeman's spokesman, Richard Amos, said he was waiting to talk to the sprint star and could not comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Kinnear said the Sorry Day Committee would probably make an official statement asking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to withdraw the ad for Freeman's sake and that of other indigenous Australians.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  marketing director Brent Scrimshaw denied the company was commenting on or capitalising on the reconciliation debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This advertisement features 20 athletes -- all of whom have to make choices in order to become the best they can be," Mr Scrimshaw said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our only intention is for people to gain an appreciation of these sacrifices and an insight into the lives of athletes. (Cathy's) reference to 'Can we talk about this later?' illustrates that all she wants to do is focus on running -- she's too busy to stop and talk. It's a sacrifice."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a second component to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Olympic advertising campaign, giving further insight into the lives of elite athletes, would be launched soon.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EDMONTON -- A runner's speedo-meter invented by a University of Alberta engineering professor has been snapped up by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as one of five new high-tech devices for the ''digital athlete,'' the sports marketing giant unveiled yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The device, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will sell with a version of its popular Triax wristwatch for $199 U.S. starting in October in the United States and soon after that in Canada, consists of sensors and a microprocessor designed to clip onto shoe laces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a sophisticated wireless gadget that measures stride length and velocity and transmits the information to the watch, which gives constant speed and distance readouts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken Fyfe, who teaches mechanical engineering at the U of A, came up with the idea a few years ago while talking with his wife, Anne Galloway, about ideas for a design project to give his students. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A veteran marathon runner, she suggested something to help runners improve their training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Fyfe, also a runner and coach of the Leduc Track club, decided he'd work on it himself rather than giving it to his students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He later formed a company called Dynastream Innovations Inc. with his younger brother Kip, an electrical engineer in Cochrane, Alta., to further develop prototypes and shop it around to sports equipment manufacturers, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Fyfe said his invention, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is labelling the SDM (Speed Distance Monitor) Triax 100, is a big improvement over the typical pedometer. A pedometer is a stride counter that counts the number of steps you take and then uses what you think is your average stride length to tell you how far you've gone, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''This thing is actually measuring each and every stride. So even if you change your stride length, this calculates that.'' It's more than 97 per cent accurate and can also be used to store data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clare Hammil, vice- president of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Equipment, said at a news conference at company headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, that of the five devices the company touted yesterday, it was most excited about the speed and distance watch. ''The simple question when you go out for a run, go for a walk, you're out hiking, is how far did I go and how fast did I move?''
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  created a new division it is calling \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Techlab to market the speed-distance monitor and four other new products for what it's calling the dotcom or digital athlete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its other products include a new heart monitor, a portable digital audio player, a backcountry wristwatch that will give out altitude, compass and weather readings and a new two-way radio for snowboarders, hikers and the like.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ray Riley, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Equipment creative director, called the speed- distance watch a simple out-of-the-box solution for today's athletes who are hungry for information about their workout. ''You take it out, you put the little pod on your foot, you put your watch on, you push a button and you go and you find out what you need.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Fyfe said getting the product to this stage has been a long and sometimes difficult project. Some of the research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and the university's industry liaison office helped Mr. Fyfe to get a patent and provided some money to develop better prototypes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But at one point Mr. Fyfes' company ran out of money and had to shut down. Kip ran the company out of his garage, said Mr. Fyfe. And a meeting with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials was held at a kitchen table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It has literally been running on a shoestring, no pun intended,'' he said. ''So many roadblocks had to be overcome. But it has been a lot of fun to work on.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stands for victory. But is victory about to require runners to encapsulate themselves from head to toe in cocoons of clingfilm? Our athletics correspondent announces that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the manufacturer of sportswear, has developed a bodysuit that may cut a nanosecond off the Exocet swoosh of runners down the track.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Its Swift Suit is to be worn for the first time today. It has been developed by an English fashion designer in order to get the fastest performance out of muscle temperature and aerodynamics. This means using darker colours and lighter textiles to cover certain bits of the body, and wearing a bodysuit from hood to ankle in order to reduce wind drag. The suit has been tested in a wind tunnel. It is intended to work in a similar way to the dimples on a golf ball. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Science is more obviously useful to sports that use equipment, such as the pole vault, cycling and the javelin. The swimmers have developed a shark-fin suit. But the oldest sport, the sprint, also always uses technology in order to run faster. Coroebus of Elis, a cook, is the first recorded Olympic champion. He wore bare feet to win the footrace the length of the stadium (192 metres) at Olympia in 776BC. But thereafter the sprinters were made to discard their shorts and run naked in order to reduce wind drag and opponent drag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Employing a goddess to trip up the opposition was regarded as cheating, as drugs are today. But, as with drugs, winners were seldom disqualified because of their goddess. Leather replaced bare feet, rubber replaced leather, and spikes replaced rubber. It is hard to see how spikes can be made even lighter or faster, though the manufacturers will manage it. Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell sprinted in baggy shorts which were the latest Varsity togs. Linford Christie ran in streamlined kit. Sprinters now shave their heads in order to reduce wind resistance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sprinting is the oldest and simplest of sports. Since man got up on his hind legs, he has been putting one leg in front of the other. Any fool can do it. But it takes a superhuman kind of folly to do it for 100 metres in less than 10 seconds. The sprinters' aerodynamic pod is going to make life harder for the commentators. When every runner looks like Spiderman, or Superman wearing his underpants outside his colour-coded bodystocking, spectators will have only the lanes to identify the runners. Joggers, who already advertise their egos in university vests to which they are not entitled, will have a new livery. It may even spur them to run faster. But to run first will still require guts and go, and, if she is available, a lucky goddess.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT IS THE world's biggest marketing bonanza with more than one hundred million viewers in 100 countries. The Olympics are used to sell everything from pet food to insurance, but for the world's biggest sports company the games have turned into a PR false start.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the US has been condemned as 'stupid and repellent' after an advertisement featuring the runner Suzy Favor Hamilton provoked outrage among viewers who said it encouraged violence against women. The giant American network, NBC, which has exclusive rights to screen the Olympics in the US, has banned the multi-million dollar commercial. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It features Hamilton being threatened by a chainsaw-wielding assassin in a remote cabin. In a spoof of the classic slasher movie, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, she escapes and is chased through the surrounding forest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trainers Hamilton begins to out-run her assailant who is forced to stop and rest. He pulls off his ice hockey mask, breathing heavily, before giving up and heading home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The last shot shows Hamilton vanishing into the moonlight. 'Why Sport?' the title flashes. 'Because you'll live longer.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  insists the advertisement is tongue in cheek, but commentators say it is offensive. 'It is stupid, ill-conceived and repellent,' said Bob Garfield of Advertising Age . The Washington Post called it 'a far cry from the inspiring and empowering "Just Do It"ads.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The New York Times quoted a reader who labelled the new ad 'disgusting and misogynistic'. At a Women in Advertising awards banquet the commercial was singled out for setting back the cause of women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Industry observers have accused \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of adopting 'double standards' in advertising women's and men's brands. Barbara Lippert of AdWeek says the commercials targeting men tend to be 'loose, playful and cartoonish', often making fun of the very athletes who endorse \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  products. The women's ads, by contrast, are earnest, even threatening.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  defends its ad as 'humane and ironic'. Mike Wilskey, vice president of Marketing, said: 'We are disappointed that NBC has chosen to take our ad off the air. Our rule has always been to respect the intelligence of our consumer. This notion that we owe all women an apology is certainly open to conjecture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'People are going berserk. They're saying, "We get this. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't." When the reality is that women are emailing us in huge numbers saying, "I get this. I understand this. I understand what you were trying to do with this ad".'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  insists its new 'Why Sport' series of commercials presents the benefits of physical fitness in extraordinary ways. The ads have a look and feel of classic cinematic moments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite the outcry, some industry executives agree. Russell Davis, planning director at ad agency Wieden & Kennedy, says that in the advertisement Hamilton is treated as an athlete rather than as a 'woman athlete'. She is the winner, not the victim. The shift in strategy is deliberate, he says. At one point, it felt like here was something that needed to be said about women's role in sports. It was all about empowerment, and self-image, and "if you let me play".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'Now women's sports are higher profile. They're much more on equal footing with men. And the advertising is starting to reflect it.' Davis adds: 'In the last year or so, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has injected a lot more humour, a lot more playfulness, in its treatment of women athletes. It treats Suzy Hamilton pretty much the same as Andre Agassi. It's not a role-model, "go out and be like Suzy" kind of thing. It's more like: "We have athletes we love, and we want to put them in our communication".'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  * UK sports stars are not the only Britons breaking records in the Sydney Olympics which end today. BBC1 and BBC2 have increased their share of the peak-time audience by an average 20 per cent. The number of viewers of the games is up one-third on the last Olympics in Atlanta.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unofficial viewing figures show that the BBC's daytime viewing was up from between 1million and 1.5m to around 2-2.5m - 35 per cent of the audience. When Steve Redgrave captured his fifth gold medal in consecutive Olympics, BBC1 took 75 per cent of the audience.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The other shoe is about to drop for Toronto Raptor sensation Vince Carter, bringing with it a windfall worth about $11.5-million (U.S.). 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter, who is working out with the U.S. Olympic team in Honolulu in preparation for the Sydney Olympic Games, is to sign a sponsorship deal with shoe conglomerate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for a reported $30-million, a National Basketball Association source confirmed yesterday.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The six-year deal, details of which are being fine-tuned, would see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clear a $14.5-million debt that Carter owes Puma, the shoe company with which Carter had initially signed an endorsement deal before joining the Raptors two seasons ago. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Carter became dissatisfied with Puma last year and tried to walk away from the contract. The matter went to arbitration in the United States and the arbitrator ruled in Puma's favour, saying that Carter owned the company $13.5-million plus an additional $1-million in lawyer fees. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ruling, which came down after the conclusion of the 1999-2000 NBA season, prohibited the 23-year-old forward from signing an endorsement deal with another company for three years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Under the terms of the new agreement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would clear Carter's debt with Puma and then pay their competitor an additional $5-million to release the high-flying dunk king from the initial contract. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The remaining money, about $11.5-million, will go into Carter's pocket. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Associated Press on Tuesday reported Carter denying a new deal had been reached. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I just got out of a Puma suit, so how can I have a deal ready?" Carter said. "Everybody's jumping the gun." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, a source close to the negotiations with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Puma, who did not want to be identified, said the new deal should be announced within the next week or two. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "For Vince, to not have to worry about this once and for all would allow him to focus on basketball," the source said. "For him, he'd like to get it done as soon as possible." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Officials with both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Puma were unavailable for comment yesterday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Under the terms of the arbitration ruling, Carter was required to continue to wear the Puma brand when he played basketball. He did so but grudgingly, often covering up the Puma logo on the shoes with tape or blacking it out with ink. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sneaker scenario certainly had no bearing on Carter's performance last season, as he guided the Raptors to their first appearance in the NBA playoffs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He was the leading vote-getter for the starting lineups in the NBA all-star game where he soared to victory in the slam-dunk competition. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is believed that Carter's deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is among the most lucrative involving NBA players. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also has signed golfer Tiger Woods to a new endorsement package, a five-year deal believed to be worth $122-million. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Raptors president Richard Peddie said he had no knowledge of Carter's pending shoe deal. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "You want your players being focused on the game and you want them to be financially secure," Peddie said. "The less players have to worry about, the better. We're huge fans of Vince. We want it to all work out for him."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To the ranks of Olympic titans \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Reebok, Speedo and Adidas, the Sydney Games have added Li Ning, Lynne O'Donnell reports
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONCE China's most famous athlete and now one of its foremost entrepreneurs, Li Ning has vaulted from the winners' podium to real gold with a line of eponymous sportswear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His now-famous L-shaped swoosh has made a breakthrough in Sydney as Li Ning is not just clothing the Chinese squad, but members of the French team as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Known as the Gymnastics Prince, Li Ning, 37, earned his placed in China's sporting history with a string of spectacular performances throughout the 1980s -- including three gold medals at Los Angeles -- that catapulted him to fame. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Business beckoned after retirement, and by the early 90s Li Ning Sportswear boutiques, with their distinctive white swoosh on a red background, began popping up in big cities around China.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Today, Li Ning is the largest sportswear manufacturer in the country. Total sales last year surpassed 600 million yuan ($133million) and are projected to reach 700 million yuan this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While his "L" swoosh now has an estimated 50 per cent of the Chinese market for sports and casual wear, according to figures published in state-run newspapers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has about 30 per cent and Adidas about 10 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The remainder of the market is shared between a handful of domestic and international manufacturers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The secret of Li Ning's success, according to analysts, is his appeal to China's essentially casual culture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Adidas and the other international sports apparel companies came to the world's biggest potential market to cash in on the faddish approach of Chinese consumers to famous brand names, Li Ning's strategy was to appeal to the youth-teen market, as young men and women in the early 90s were only just developing an interest in sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As the Europeans and Americans went for the high end of the market, Li Ning kept his clothing affordable: the most expensive athletic shoes in his line cost about 300 yuan ($66).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To the ranks of Olympic titans \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Reebok, Speedo and Adidas, the Sydney Games have added Li Ning, Lynne O'Donnell reports
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONCE China's most famous athlete and now one of its foremost entrepreneurs, Li Ning has vaulted from the winners' podium to real gold with a line of eponymous sportswear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  His now-famous L-shaped swoosh has made a breakthrough in Sydney as Li Ning is not just clothing the Chinese squad, but members of the French team as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Known as the Gymnastics Prince, Li Ning, 37, earned his placed in China's sporting history with a string of spectacular performances throughout the 1980s -- including three gold medals at Los Angeles -- that catapulted him to fame. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Business beckoned after retirement, and by the early 90s Li Ning Sportswear boutiques, with their distinctive white swoosh on a red background, began popping up in big cities around China.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Today, Li Ning is the largest sportswear manufacturer in the country. Total sales last year surpassed 600 million yuan ($133million) and are projected to reach 700 million yuan this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While his "L" swoosh now has an estimated 50 per cent of the Chinese market for sports and casual wear, according to figures published in state-run newspapers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has about 30 per cent and Adidas about 10 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The remainder of the market is shared between a handful of domestic and international manufacturers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The secret of Li Ning's success, according to analysts, is his appeal to China's essentially casual culture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Adidas and the other international sports apparel companies came to the world's biggest potential market to cash in on the faddish approach of Chinese consumers to famous brand names, Li Ning's strategy was to appeal to the youth-teen market, as young men and women in the early 90s were only just developing an interest in sport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As the Europeans and Americans went for the high end of the market, Li Ning kept his clothing affordable: the most expensive athletic shoes in his line cost about 300 yuan ($66).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Li Ning has 450 stores in China and has sponsored Chinese athletes in every Games since Barcelona in 1992.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  HARD-UP Vladimir Voltchkov is guaranteed a bumper pounds 120,000 Wimbledon semi-final pay-day - after being so skint he had to borrow a pair of shorts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Voltchkov, 22, the first qualifier to reach the semis since John McEnroe in 1977, had to wear the same T-shirt as last year because he had spent all his spare cash on going to see the hit film Gladiator four times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And his Russian tennis pal Marat Safin had to lend him a pair of shorts because he came to England with no new kit. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And the Belarus blaster, ranked 237th in the world, has now been offered kit sponsorship deals with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and adidas on the back of his amazing Wimbledon success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Voltchkov has also landed a dream showdown - and guaranteed pay cheque for reaching the semi-finals - with top seed Pete Sampras on Centre Court tomorrow.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Voltchkov, who beat Zimbabwean Byron Black 7-6 7-6 6-4, said: "I had the same stuff from last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The shorts I wore were from Marat Safin because I came here with no new clothes. It's been very tough for me financially and to reach the semi-finals and earn some money is a dream come true.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I've had injury problems and when you're playing minor tournaments around the world it's very hard to earn money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't have a kit sponsor so I ended up wearing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and adidas gear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were kind enough to give me two pairs of shoes for my match today and adidas gave me one pair for last week."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, Voltchkov admitted he has been wasting his spare cash in London on going to the cinema since arriving two weeks ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I've been to see Gladiator four times so no wonder I can't afford the kit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I'm sure I could afford now to go to posh restaurants but my dad is a good cook and I prefer to eat at the flat we've rented together."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is, of course, the furthest Voltchkov has ever been in a Grand Slam tournament - and all after having to win three qualifying matches to reach the competition proper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said: "I don't think everything has sunk in yet. I used to watch John McEnroe on TV and I always admired him. Someone mentioned to me the other day about becoming the first qualifier since McEnroe to reach the semi-finals and I've kept it in my head.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "To play Pete Sampras in the semi-finals - what else could you wish for? It's a dream come true and an honour for me.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Grass seems to suit my game, but how do I beat Sampras? That's a good question. He is probably the greatest player of all time and if he's in the mood then it will be very difficult for me. But if I can do my best and give him a good game then I'll be very happy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Disappointed Black, ranked 37th in the world, believes Sampras will finally end the underdog's charge to glory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Black said: "With the way Pete's playing, I don't think Vladimir could beat him. He's a flashy player. When I thought I had him he would beat me with a great shot."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Voltchkov, who won the Wimbledon junior title in 1996, has consistently defied all the odds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Now bookies Hills have him 12-1 for the title, with Sampras the 8-11 favourite, Andre Agassi 5-2 and Pat Rafter 4-1.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tiger Woods endorses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf balls in television and magazine ads, but he really plays with custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledged Tuesday after being sued in federal court.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. said the balls used by Woods, who is one of the longest hitters in golf with drives that travel 300-plus yards, have a slightly harder inner and outer core than the balls sold to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed ball,'' said Mike Kelly, marketing director for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Golf. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the public different products than what the pros use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes to golf products: Irons, putters and golf balls for tour players,'' Kelly said. ''Slight specification and modifications need to be made to their equipment for their game.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly what their pros endorse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist of Fairhaven, Mass., said its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player uses a ''tweaked'' version of a club, he said, a consumer could special order it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We are very particular about our advertisements,'' said Gomes. ''We don't make any claims that cannot be substantiated in both golf balls and clubs.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Callaway Golf of Carlsbad, Calif., said if one of its golf pros says he uses a certain club, that identical club is available retail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spokesman Larry Dorman did say, however, that in February, one of its golf balls had a different number of dimples on it than the ones its pros used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That occurred, he said, because Callaway was waiting approval of the new ball by the U.S. Golf Association, so the company's pros were briefly forbidden from using it in tournaments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We used a prototype with a different number of dimples,'' Dorman said. ''As a result, for a very short period of time, there was a little bit of a lapse from what was being marketed. We were very up front about it.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the lawsuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. district court in San Francisco, a nonprofit group called Public Remedies Inc.  claimed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  based in Beaverton, Ore., was engaging in unfair business practices. It asks that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ''ill-gotten gains'' be restored to the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Tiger Woods does not play the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy golf ball, but instead plays one with a different composition and performance characteristics specially made for him . . . and not available to the general public,'' the suit said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group did not return repeated calls for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woods switched to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tour Accuracy ball before the U.S. Open, the first of his three major titles this year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  AUSTRALIAN athletes and officials knocked back a true blue look in Olympic uniforms to stick with the green and gold.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sportswear designer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wanted the Australian Olympic Committee to include more navy blue in the competition outfits, insisting that navy blue was a more "fashionable" colour than Australia's traditional Olympic look. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But AOC athlete director Herb Elliott sent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  designers back to the drawing board with the instruction that green and gold was not to be watered down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They navy was cut back very quickly," Elliott said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The competition outfits were unveiled yesterday and met with widespread praise from athletes and officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most attention focused on the track and field "swift suit". The head-to-toe aerodynamic suit is mariner emerald green on the front with maize yellow striping on the rear. For the first time in Olympic history, athletes competing in all 28 sports will have an integrated design throughout the uniforms and Australia's Paralympians will wear the same outfits as Olympic athletes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Several of the futuristic uniforms feature streamlined design, lightweight construction materials and "bodymapping" to highlight the muscle tones of athletes. The stars of the Southern Cross are also emblazoned on most outfits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 50 designers worked on 253 uniform styles for the 28 sports with 87,528 items to be manufactured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sizes range from xxxS for gymnasts to 6XL for basketballers and weightlifters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AOC president John Coates declared the uniforms the best in Australian Olympic history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Elliott said his favourite outfit was the presentation tracksuit Australians would wear on the medal podium.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spartak captain Andrei Tikhonov was taking penalties, hundreds of kids were clamoring for CSKA star Alexei Smertin's autograph and Lokomotiv goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin was letting in only his second goal in nearly 1,000 minutes, but Alexander Ivanov, 11, was just trying to stand while sweating heavily. Ivanov was one of a half dozen or so wide, lumpy figures walking awkwardly around like sumo wrestlers at Kudrinskaya Ploshchad on Thursday. Wearing 58 different pieces of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothing, Ivanov was attempting to be named Mr. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a title that came with a free soccer ball. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The competition was one of the sidelines to the main competition - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  search for 22 young soccer players who will get the chance to train for a day at the national team's training base at the end of the month. To have a chance, aspiring Tikhonovs had to dribble the ball through an obstacle course set up on the square, hit a target and juggle the ball for as long as possible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Kept upright by his friends, Ivanov was pushed onto the stage set up on the square and began to strip. Ten minutes later, a slight young boy emerged from the huge figure and the emcee called for a bulldozer to remove the clothes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unfortunately for Ivanov, Igor Grakh, 12, followed him onto the stage and whipped off 65 pieces of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clothing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I sat for a whole hour in these clothes," said a relieved Grakh, his face covered in self-scrawled \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swooshes, seconds after being mobbed by celebrating friends who had donated their clothes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Grakh and his friends had come in from Odintsovo in the west of Moscow especially for the event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We all play soccer there," said Grakh, as his friends began to sort out the clothes. "But we didn't come just for that. We came for the fun." Meanwhile on the specially constructed course, Lokomotiv Moscow goalie Nigmatullin, who until Wednesday's match against Samara hadn't let a goal in for eight league matches, was facing shots from kids and letting most of them in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The search for players goes on until Sunday at Kudrinskaya Ploshchad. Any youth between the ages of 13 and 16 can take part. Out of the 22, three will then be chosen to travel to the Netherlands in June during the European Championships for what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  calls a "secret mission." Other events saw pop-group Ivanushki International take to the soccer course and a Pepsi drinking contest that saw children's noses spurt with Pepsi as they raced to see who could down the most of the fizzy pop drink. At the end of the competition they got to throw drinks into the crowds with the delight of people who have a stomach full of fizz.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Soccer shirt claim
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SPORTS goods manufacturer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  today insisted there was no evidence that some of its British-made football shirts were laced with a toxic chemical. Fears have been raised over the safety of shirts of German side Borussia Dortmund after a German TV show commissioned lab tests and claimed the shirts contain a chemical used on the bottom of sea vessels, which is also used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman today confirmed the Borussia Dortmund shirts are made in Britain and Italy. He refused to say where in Britain they are made. He repeated that initial testing had failed to find any Tributyltin, or TBT. "Initial research findings suggest that TBT is not used in production of the garment," he said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also make shirts for Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers, though not in Britain. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both clubs reported no concern over their shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said Borussia Dortmund shirts were made by sub contractors in Britain which specialise in manufacturing football shirts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Further tests are being carried out and we await the results of those," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are consulting outside industry experts and fabric suppliers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He repeated the company's message to the public n "Don't pani?".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And he added: "Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 mf 3 CONSUMER \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Substitute
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A scientist with a German institute for consumer health has said that TBT at high levels in humans is believed to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyse the risks," Juergen Kundke said. "We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn't be in textiles that people wear."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three German department store chains have withdrawn the GBP 47 yellow and black shirts, as a precaution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 British and Dutch tests have shown that TBT can cause mutations in marine snails, and there have been calls for its global ban.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has said it does not appear British retailers are following their German counterparts by withdrawing the kit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The spokesman said it makes Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers shirts, but not in this country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Glasgow Rangers spokeswoman said: "We have sold 72,000 home jerseys in our shops since the shirt's launch last July and we have had no problem with them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Only four have been returned and that is nothing to do with this issue."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An Arsenal spokeswoman said: "We have discussed the matter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and at the present time have no cause to recall any replica shirts from our club shops."

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Phil Knight, the chief executive of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  withdrew a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon last month, his announcement had the tone of an angry parent. He chastised the university for joining the Worker Rights Consortium, a group that monitors conditions in factories that make clothing with college logos. He accused the university of "inserting itself into the new global economy where I make my living" and doing so "on the wrong side, fumbling a teachable moment."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Knight, an Oregon graduate, was angry that the university had joined this consortium rather than the Fair Labor Association, a group that includes as members the same industries that have profited from sweatshop conditions in their production plants. The Worker Rights Consortium is based on the premise that work conditions will not be changed by codes and monitors that come from industry, but by involvement of workers, through collective bargaining with management. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In joining the consortium, the University of Oregon pledged to use its influence to improve conditions at factories producing clothes with the university logo. Mr. Knight, accusing his alma mater of shredding its "bonds of trust" with him, seemed offended that it had not asked his permission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The university's decision was not made lightly. In March, a referendum sponsored by the student government yielded a three-fourths majority vote in support of membership. A committee accountable to the the university president, David B. Frohnmayer, and made up of students, faculty, administrators and alumni, voted unanimously the same month in favor of joining. Then the University Senate, composed of faculty and students, passed a resolution calling for membership. It was only after all these steps that President Frohnmayer signed the university into membership.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Knight's punitive reaction really questions the autonomy of the university itself. If the voice of one alumnus held more weight than a year of university-wide deliberation, what role would there be for shared governance on campus? If donations from corporate America depended on toeing a corporate line, the university would be better off without the money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The goal of students across the country who are organizing around sweatshop issues is to create widespread change in an industry where insufficient wages and mandatory overtime are common. In many third world and American apparel factories, there have been reports of intimidation of workers who try to speak out. And because it is easy for these factories to cut and run, vanishing across national borders and abandoning workers, many people are hesitant to organize unions or demand a living wage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Worker Rights Consortium and the student anti-sweatshop campaign challenge companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not only to let the public know the conditions in apparel factories, but to begin long-term change.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Will the debate about sweatshop conditions move beyond the specifics of monitoring and toward establishing the right to organize? Phil Knight's withdrawal of money from the University of Oregon sends the signal that his company is resisting a move in that direction.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 NIKE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Starbucks and Coke are. C&A, Principles and Rover most definitely aren't. It don't mean a thing these days, it seems, unless you're a multinational, monolithic brand that punters can't avoid. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Until recently, we were told by business gurus that only downsizing and restructuring would keep a company's body and soul together. Now they've changed their minds: there's only one magic ingredient. If you haven't been successfully branded, then you might as well not bother queuing up at the global goodie counter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Branding isn't just the new rock 'n' roll, it's the new religion, because it's not just about anything as vulgar as selling goods or services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Products are made in the factory," says Walter Landor of Landor, one of the world's leading branding agencies, "but brands are made in the mind."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ad agencies now like to think of themselves as brand factories, hammering out ideas and attitudes. Consumers no longer buy products but the feel good, lifestyle enhancing "value added" of brands. It's the difference between a similar pair of trainers from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Millets and it's about \'a380.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the new global marketplace where all penetrating, successful brands can only get bigger, the rest just curl up and die. It's why, for example, the Labour Party felt it necessary to jettison many of its voter-losing policies, cobble together some new ones and give themselves a new name, just in case we hadn't twigged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Branding isn't just about thinking big - it's about extending your product line in as many different ways as possible. It's why Benetton and Microsoft have gone into the magazine business, why Ally McBeal has her own line of designer clothing, why Tommy Hilfiger has helped launch a record label and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is even set to launch a swooshed cruise ship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's also why young activists opposed to this kind of globalised branding, and its effect on choice, targeted companies like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Starbucks at last year's Seattle World Trade Organisation meeting. As Naomi Klein in No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies states, these mega-successful brands are "emblematic of a new paradigm that eliminates all barriers between branding and culture, leaving no room whatsoever for unmarketed space."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  When the B-word reaches your office, don't expect your company to be able to manage things by themselves. Do expect an endless series of meetings with outside branding consultants which cost thousands of pounds and repeat what everyone has been saying for years, free of charge, in the office kitchen .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The overall branding strategy then goes into overdrive. From products and customer service to internal communications and even the tea lady (something to do with serving ciabatta), everything must be "on message".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Everyone must promise not to giggle when they're told they sell a brand, not a widget.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And, be warned, even your emails could soon be joining this massive branding exercise - edesigns.co.uk claim that the majority of email users are fed up with boring backgrounds and are failing to appreciate the brilliant branding potential of using existing logos and letterheads electronically.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The company is currently asking executive secretaries to help their bosses see the light.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After all, no bright PA wants their company to go the same way as poor old C&A.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The way ahead? Or the emperor's new Armani clothes? Don't worry, you'll soon get the message.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'It's nice, Mummy, but is it Eames?'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Children barely out of nappies have long been able to discriminate between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and M&S, but now the label obsession has extended to interior decor. HESTER LACEY reports on the power of the toddler pound
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's a fact of modern life that children today are inordinately fashion -conscious. Try fobbing off a tiny style maven with the wrong label and it will end in tears (even Start-rite, the traditional doyen of sensible T-bar school shoes, now has a Jolie Amie "couture" range). Still, there are only so many tiny cashmere separates, designer sunglasses and special kiddies' beauty products one can buy. So now, marketers have latched on to the final frontier in capitalism for kids - interior design. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Children today aren't limited to garish furniture and fittings; bedroom decor for a six-year-old can be just as minimalist, stylish, understated - and, naturally, expensive - as that of their elders. Despite the hefty price tags, tasteful parents who react to Superman duvet covers and Barbie dressing-tables with a shudder of horror are likely to see this as a positive step. So, how do you educate your child away from Thomas the Tank Engine and towards something less lurid?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One could start with the latest slant on the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, subtitled "A Tale Moderne". In this new book, the bears' house in the woods is no longer the wooden shack of tradition - it is a modern, split-level house, furnished with design classics, to teach children about the niceties of form and function, style and elegance. "They could have had rough-hewn log furniture, but why bother?" says Steven Guarnaccia, the author, who is also an illustrator and designer. "The furniture is as much a character of the book as the little bears."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Daddy Bear's chair is a Charles Rennie Mackintosh ladder back, Mummy Bear's chair is one of Arne Jacobsen's Eggs, while Baby Bear parks his furry behind on a Charles & Ray Eames LCW model (when the trespassing Goldilocks sits on the chair, it falls to bits - an example of gratuitous vandalism that will have grown-up aficionados sobbing). These bears have no truck with porridge - they eat chilli with Gio Ponti spoons from Eva Zeisel bowls. And when they go off into the woods to wait for their chilli to cool, Mama Bear is decked out in a trendy headscarf, bright-red lipstick and a Conran shirt, while Dad is wearing a beret and shades and carrying his clarinet. Goldilocks has trendy pedal pushers and a Fifties-style ponytail and fringe. While she is nosing about in the duplex, she finds an Alessandro Becchi sofa and a Sixties Italian-style blow-up bed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The book is aimed at three-to-seven-year-olds, though as a spokeswoman for publishers Harry N Abrams cannily remarks, there will be plenty of grown-ups who enjoy it, too. "The children will notice the furniture quite naturally," she says. "It's not in-your-face 'let's learn about designer furniture'. Parents who have an appreciation of designer furniture will draw the child's attention to the pictures, and the funky images will turn kids on to remembering. The drawings and colours are very appealing, and the pictures look very tactile."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There's a similar approach to architecture in Arches to Zigzags: an Architecture ABC by Michael J Crosbie and Steve and Kit Rosenthal. If your child doesn't know its finials from its quoins, or its turrets from its X -braces, this is the place to start. There are simple rhymes and jingles to make the notions stick in small heads. The idea of the book is to "stimulate young readers to think about the built world around them in a creative, thought- provoking way".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Once your infant is rejecting Pokemon spin-offs with a pout in favour of Arne Jacobsen, what's the next step? To start redecorating, evidently. A recent issue of Junior (a kind of Vogue for parents) featured some suggestions, with not a Postman Pat motif in sight. "Think of a child's room and you may not instantly think tasteful decor and beautiful knick-knacks, but it is possible," ran the editorial. One interior designer's eight-month- old son apparently rejoices in a bedroom where "the mood is slightly Norwegian, with paintwork picked out in duck-egg blue and a sophisticated black edging line throughout". Another set of designer infants, aged eight, six and four, have a bathroom decorated with a bespoke 14th -century map of Europe. "It's great fun and educational to talk about places we've travelled to and would like to visit while they're splashing around in the bath," says their mother.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  You will, however, have to put some effort into seeking out such tasteful accoutrements. "We looked at what was already available in children's furniture and we weren't impressed," says Jerwood Prize-winning furniture designer Michael Marriott. Working with fellow designer Simon Maidment, Marriott has just completed Biscuit, a collection for Oreka Kids, a newly established manufacturer of children's goods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What is currently around, Marriott complains, tends to be like "oversized toys". Children, he says, are very aware of their surroundings, yet they are definitely neglected when it comes to design. "There's very little out there that is good quality, aesthetically pleasing and built to last," he says. The Biscuit range is made up of "pieces with an identity in their own right - playful not childish; furniture that children can grow up with and live with as adults".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The collection includes tables, chairs, benches and trolleys, available in tastefully understated shades of blue and yellow, trendy orange, or neutral wood. One of Marriott's favourites is "Shortcake", a reversible bench that can become a boat, car or ship. "It reminds me of the benches in school gyms, which can be used for all kinds of different exercises," he says. "Ours is supplied with slots and broomsticks so you can turn it over and put up a mast to make a ship, or add wheels to make a car. But it's also a normal bench to sit on."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He also likes "Jammy Dodger", a pair of little step units that can be put together as a seat and desk, or used as chairs or steps. "Often, kids don't want to be told what they want," says Marriott. "These will be props to the child's own imagination."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But all this design brilliance comes at a price. Shortcake is the cheapest in the range at pounds 805, while Jammy Dodger is pounds 970. They are, says Marriott, an investment. "They will last a lifetime because they are sturdy and because their lifespan isn't dictated by the look of them - they will fit into an adult home." Other companies such as Purves & Purves (tiny copies of the classic Ant chair) and The Conran Shop (mini sofas and kiddies' garden furniture) have also started catering for the little people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is a trend not lost on canny property developers, who are concentrating on designs for family homes that are as child-friendly as possible. One company, Countryside, puts the youngsters' bedrooms on the second floor, underneath the roof, so that they have their own lofty domain. In some houses, Countryside will include a children's "Jack and Jill" bathroom, accessible from the bedrooms on either side. There are also touches to make the house irresistible to the kids: wallpaper with clouds (accessorised with miniature planes or futuristic silvery themes) or bright, clear colours and a variety of carefully chosen toys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "When you buy off-the-shelf for children, it's often Postman Pat or the Teletubbies, and yes, they like it," says Helen Moore, Countryside's sales and marketing director. "But children are aware of plenty of other things. We don't use characters; we don't need to. We pick themes children can talk about and relate to so it feels like their own space, and they can see how their room could be special and different. It's amazing how much they notice - how aware they are from a very young age and how young they develop their own preferences."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So, how will kids react to a sudden dose of interior style? How far can small children understand a concept of good taste that doesn't include the Teletubbies? Six-year-old Daniel isn't sure, and nor is his mother, Caroline Talbot. "Daniel is more interested in climbing on furniture, while my two-year-old, Anna, prefers to chew or crayon on it," she says. "Anna will chew anything. If she had a designer chair, she would simply dribble on it." Daniel's favourite piece of furniture is his own bed, the duvet for which he chose himself. What kind of bed is it? "It came from a shop," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Melanie, aged eight, says that shopping for the home is far from her favourite activity. "When we go to IKEA, it takes a long time and you have to queue a lot. Mum and Dad get really fed up and I do too." Her favourite furniture store, she says, is a toy shop where she can buy things for her doll's house, which has a four-poster bed and a tiny loo that really flushes. It's just as well her desires are simple. "Melanie might develop expensive tastes, but we'll still be trekking to IKEA," says her mum, Kim. n

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently Tara VanDerveer took a one-day break from her routine as Stanford women's basketball coach to be a player on Madison Avenue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her acting stint can be seen in one of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  new "Bracketville" commercials, which started to air last month .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I haven't seen the one I'm in," VanDerveer said. "I've heard it's pretty funny." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The commercials -- created by Portland advertising firm Weiden and Kennedy, and directed by Joe Pytka -- promote Bracketville, a fictional small town populated by college basketball icons. College mascots, including Stanford's Tree, frolic like kids in a front yard as retired coaches Dean Smith and John Thompson sit on a porch; the local drive-in plays the classic Duke-Kentucky regional final; shoes grow on trees picked by former Marquette coach Al McGuire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In VanDerveer's commercial, she, Iowa State Coach Bill Fennelly and Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer visit Bracketville Hardware. The store is staffed by former college stars Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Chamique Holdsclaw.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In VanDerveer's scene, she studies a sign that reads "Beware of the Underdog" -- a reference to the Cardinal's early-round losses to Harvard and Maine the past two seasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But she shot another scene that did not make the final cut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 VanDerveer was supposed to take a pair of scissors from Holdsclaw. The scissors, labeled the Cutmaster 2000, are supposed to be used to sever the net to celebrate a championship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The scene was shot several times with VanDerveer handling the scissors without saying a word. But Pytka wanted to give VanDerveer a speaking part.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "So (Holdsclaw) says something like, 'These are the scissors I use. These should work well,' " VanDerveer said. "I just have to say, 'Hope so.' But I blew my line."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pytka looked at VanDerveer and said: "Stanford, do you need to study the script?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The commercial was shot Jan. 20 at Fulkerson's Hardware in Somis, a small Southern California town near Camarillo. Filming occurred "the day before the Cal game (at Stanford). I was a little leery of it, but it worked out well because of the timing of it," VanDerveer said. "It was a fun change of pace."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Said copywriter Ian Cohen, who collaborated with art director Matt Peterson on the ads: "(VanDerveer) was terrific. We had a blast with her. She's one of the more recognizable faces in women's sports."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  HERE's a challenge that would stump any Olympic athlete and confound any Olympic reporter: use the words "torsion", "exigence" and "adiprene" in one sentence. Adidas has fitted them all on a single sneaker.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Torsion is the act of twisting, exigence (the name of the shoe) means urgency, and adiprene is unbeknown to my dictionary and presumably the invention of an Adidas marketing genius, possibly meaning "very expensive but extremely comfortable". Torsion footwear was trendy in the early 90s and these men's running shoes are the sort which could be worn out with classy jeans to illustrate that athleticism and aestheticism need not be mutually exclusive. They're blokes' shoes, but this female reviewer would have no qualms in wearing them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They've got an easy fit which induces that bouncy sensation, making even a bum like me feel there's hope for my fitness. But frankly, I think "exigence" is a tad overdone.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   When John Forzani set out to buy a television set this year, he avoided going to a Sony-owned store. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a retailer himself, he doesn't favour suppliers that set up their own shops. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  So Mr. Forzani, chairman of sporting-goods chain Forzani Group Ltd. in Calgary, instead bought a $3,500, 30-inch-screen Sony television at Sounds Around, a local consumer electronics store that carries a lot of the brand. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I'm fundamentally opposed to manufacturers being in the retail business," Mr. Forzani says.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's a conflict . . . It makes it extremely difficult to compete with them." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Such views haven't stopped \b \i0 \ul0 Sony of Canada Ltd.\b0 \i0 \ul0  from forging ahead with 72 stores across the country. It's a unique situation for the company worldwide, which has few corporate-owned outlets elsewhere. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On Saturday, Sony opened its flagship store at Toronto Eaton Centre, a sleek, brightly lit haven for gadget-seekers with lots of televisions, stereo sets and PlayStations blaring as interactivity reaches a new level in retail. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Still, the transformation of supplier into retailer is a delicate issue for many merchants because these manufacturers' stores snag precious sales. Sporting goods maker \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. is among the high-profile names that also run their own stores. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The issue is heating up as more manufacturers, Sony and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among them, have set up Web sites and started to peddle their products on-line directly to consumers, bypassing the retailer. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Still, Sony officials maintain they have found a balance between running their retail business and appeasing rival dealers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We're not about stealing market share from our dealers," says Blair Severn, national marketing manager at Toronto-based Sony. The stores are a showcase for the brand and, in most cases, shoppers compare prices elsewhere before making a purchase, he says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  What is more, Sony stores don't undercut dealers' prices and give their employees incentives not to discount, he says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Retailers' resistance to the Sony stores has eased since the company took full control of the chain five years ago, he says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Indeed, dealers seem resigned to competing head-on with Sony. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't like it, but we've learned to deal with it," says Tony Scaffeo, general manager of Sounds Around Inc., which has four stores in Calgary - all of them within blocks of a Sony outlet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the other hand, Mr. Scaffeo acknowledges that competition is so fierce in consumer electronics that "if it wasn't Sony, it would be somebody else . . . Maybe they're better than somebody else." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Future Shop Ltd. also prefers to tangle with the devil it knows, spokeswoman Lori De Cou says. The 88-outlet chain even sees a silver lining in the Sony retail presence: the supplier displays its products so well that it becomes a kind of advertisement for the goods, she says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The polished look of the Sony stores - especially newer ones such as at Toronto Eaton Centre - has pushed Future Shop to sharpen its own outlets, she adds. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Shoppers at the new Toronto Sony store seem clearly impressed, although most are checking out the competition, too. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  John Stokes, 23, drops by the store every morning to play a half-hour of games on the hot new PlayStation II before heading to his construction job. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I waste my time here," he laughs as he presses buttons to manipulate the NHL 2001 players on the screen. He's thinking of buying the console ($450) and a game ($80) as a Christmas present for his five- and three-year-old children, but hasn't made any commitments yet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Leslie Vineberg, a chef at Splendido restaurant, looked at Future Shop and the Bay before shelling out for two $150 speakers at Sony - after having convinced the store to drop the 7-per-cent goods and services tax. "It's like buying a car - you always ask for something. I'm sure I could have bargained more." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She liked the presentation at the Sony store and the fact that the products were set up so she could listen to them. "You have to have it accessible to everybody so you can catch them before they have time to walk out of the store," the 47-year-old says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The story behind Sony stores in Canada dates back more than 40 years, when Winnipeg businessman Albert Cohen became the first foreign retailer to be granted a distribution deal with electronics giant Sony Corp. to sell transistor radios. In 1981, Sony stores were created when the manufacturer bought an interest in the failing dealer chain. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Still, Sony stores lost money every year until 1999, Mr. Severn says. The turnaround was helped by consumers' rush over past years to by the latest home electronics toys. As well, since Sony took over the outlets in 1995, it has hired retailing and marketing veterans to pitch the brand in the same way Gap sells its fashion label, Mr. Severn says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Stores are being relocated to more fashionable malls and revamped to blend the entertainment side of the Sony empire with the technical side. Consumers can't miss the large posters of Ricky Martin and other Sony stars; they can try out cameras and other gadgets or take a break in the darkened home theatre at the back with large-screen TV sets. Research found that consumers felt "trapped" in small glassed-in trial centres with just one television, Mr. Severn says. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This week, Sony is trying to lure even more people to the stores by mailing $10 gift certificates to its best 60,000 customers. Of those certificates, 21 have values of up to $10,000. The promotion won't make life any easier for rival dealers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The skate and hockey-equipment manufacturer, owned by footwear giant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc., has already halved the number of its Decarie Blvd. office employees to 30 in the last year, said Kiedaisch in a telephone interview from Munich, where he's on a business trip.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last week, it was disclosed that the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec appears to have called in a $\cf8 \highlight1\cb1  \cf \highlight0\cb0 136-million loan to Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief rival, The Hockey Co., revoking a previously agreed-to extension on the loan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The company now has to find another lender, or renegotiate its Caisse loan, even as its sales are dipping and the hockey boom in the U.S. abates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The two Montreal companies have cornered an estimated 62 per cent of the world's $675-million-a-year hockey-equipment market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the remaining 30 Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  head-office employees, about 20 will transfer to the company's manufacturing plant in Saint-Jerome, and the remaining 10 will start work at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  distribution centre in Greenland, N.H. The company's Saint-Jerome factory still employs 300 people, who make the company's high-end Bauer and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  skates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In-Line Skating Fad Fades
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But a drastic drop in the in-line skating fad's growth rate and outsourcing to Asia, where Oregon-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes almost all its shoes, have claimed about three-quarters of its former work force of 1,200. In addition, Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  axed its skate-plant in Cambridge, Ont., in 1997 at the cost of 400 jobs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the 2,200 people employed by Canstar Sports Inc. in 1994, when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bought the Montreal company for $546 million, there are about 850 left.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most of the cuts came under Pierre Boivin, president of Canstar before being named president of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team in August 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kiedaisch took over from Boivin a year ago. The Boston native was previously president of Bolle Inc., a family-owned French eyewear company which he took public.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  purchase price for Canstar represented a $\cf8 \highlight1\cb1  \cf \highlight0\cb0 205-million premium - about $10 per share - over the company's going price in December 1994. Most observers said at the time that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had heavily overpaid for the company, which had annual sales of over $200 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two years later, in December 1996, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  president Tom Clarke sounded an alert during an otherwise upbeat teleconference call, saying the multinational's Canadian subsidiary needed to be "repositioned."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asked specifically by The Gazette whether that meant Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was "going Asian" like its parent company, Boivin replied with a qualified "no."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that "repositioning" meant juggling the company's products, stressing that there would be "no major transfer" of production to Asia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And, he added, "the bottom line is that there are no plans for layoffs."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But market imperatives - essentially low wages in China compared with high production costs in Saint-Jerome - seem to have won out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kiedaisch said "that's one of the challenges you have at a company like this, you can't always forecast what business is going to be like down the road."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that the head-office cuts were announced in the trade press on Oct. 29, and that "further explanations" were given to employees three weeks ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kiedaisch said there's "no chance" Saint-Jerome will shutter, and added there are no more layoffs planned. The plant will keep making top-end skates, as well as hockey helmets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Bauer is a hockey company, and hockey is so Canadian," he said. "It's very, very important we maintain a Canadian culture, a Canadian presence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Bauer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  offices at the Ericsson cell-phone company's building on Decarie, where Bauer moved to under his predecessor, "are really quite beautiful, pretty upscale," said Kiedaisch.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I felt a little bit isolated, removed from our operation's facilities."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The restructuring is intended to place executives close to the heart of the operations they manage, he added, rather than have them cut off in splendid isolation, "coming down the mountain like God."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You missed the face-to-face dynamics which make a company run," added Kiedaisch. "There will no longer be a headquarters, per se."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some head-office personnel will move to their new location on April 15, others on June 20.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  LOS ANGELES -Illegal immigrants being smuggled aboard container ships tend to be better dressed and seem to enjoy better living conditions during their voyage than those brought on traditional cargo ships, according to US officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officials who have seen both types of smuggling said the containers bearing illegal immigrants tended to be more sanitary, with makeshift latrines and had better provisions, such as bedding and pillows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Old-style smuggling ships used to pack about 200 people together, while each container usually carries fewer than 25. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those immigrants detained recently were also better dressed, wearing like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tennis shoes. Some had mobile phones and compact disc players.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 US officials, however, could not say whether this meant they were more well-to-do or that they had been provided with items like proper clothing to blend in better when they finally go on to the street.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smugglers charge as much as US$ 60,000 (S$ 100,000) per person for container space, about twice the fee charged for those who come on smuggling boats, according to US authorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The exhorbitant fee, however, does not guarantee a pleasant journey in a container. For some, it remains a daunting journey.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They may have started their voyage with blankets, pillows and supplies of food and water, but by the time they arrive in the US, conditions had deteriorated to what the South China Morning Post newspaper, quoting US coast guard officials, described as "unbearable".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A group of immigrants detained off Long Beach, California, on Sunday left a container smeared with excrement and vomit. Officials said they had been at sea for 20 days.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officials have also been examining container smuggling since early last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It seems to be a troubling new trend," said Ms Sharon Gavin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS). "We're concerned that this may increase," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent cases, soft-top containers about the size of a tractor-trailer were used to carry Chinese stowaways who paid as much as US$ 70,000 each, more than twice the amount charged by people operating ships devoted to smuggling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A cargo ship can carry as many as 1,000 of these containers, which can make it difficult to detect stowaways. The smugglers also often lash down heavy canvas covers on the containers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was no evidence that the ship owners were involved in the smuggling operation but Ms Virginia Kice, another INS spokesman, said federal officials were looking into making shipping companies more responsible for the illegal immigrants by holding them liable for some of the costs of detention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the federal authorities said they would increase enforcement efforts to combat container smuggling, Ms Kice said the smugglers' change in approach was an indication that other enforcement efforts had been effective.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A start-up company operating out of a residential-area garage in Cochrane is today expected to sign a multimillion-dollar deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to supply foot sensors for the sports company's line of running shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dynastream Innovations Inc. has patented a wireless foot sensor unit which, when mounted on a shoe, can communicate with a specially designed wristwatch to calculate a runner's speed and distance travelled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The technology is intended to appeal to serious-minded athletes who until now have used clunky pedometers to gauge how far they've jogged, says Kip Fyfe, Dynastream's chief executive. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the new foot sensor, designed to fit over the shoe's lacing box, runners will be able to vary their routes, pace and stride length.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sensor is actually a series of battery-operated computer chips mounted on a circuit board, very similar to the type of technology used to inflate air bags in vehicles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concept was born out of a casual conversation between Fyfe's brother, Ken, a mechanical engineer at the University of Alberta, and Ken's wife, a seasoned marathon runner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ken was wracking his brain for a project to give his students when his spouse suggested he invent a better way for runners to train. He passed the idea on to his brother, who in December 1998 formed a new company to get a patent to market quickly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With a total of eight employees and little capital to back their venture, Dynastream now faced the challenge of shopping their idea around to different sports equipment manufacturers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With no office, the company met top \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  executives around Vicki Brilz's kitchen table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''There were times we were ready to let the whole idea go away,'' said Brilz, Dynastream's vice- president of marketing. ''But then we'd just pick up the pieces and start again.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fledgling company's persistence paid off. Under the terms of the deal, it retains ownership of the patent while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  handles all manufacturing and sales development issues. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expects to release the product in volume, although neither company could confirm numbers at this early stage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Initial orders look pretty good,'' said Fyfe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The foot sensor and watch are expected to retail for about $200, and will hit stores in time for the Christmas retail season, said Brilz.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dynastream's technology shows a lot of promise, said Ken Smiley, a senior analyst with the Giga Information Group, but is likely to be relegated to a niche market. ''I think (the shoes) will stay a kind of a novelty item, unless they become a status symbol within society as the Michael Jordan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoes did at one point.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But foot sensors also offer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a way to differentiate itself from competitors Reebok and Adidas, added Smiley.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sensor-based electronic devices have been slow to take off because processors are typically too costly to be manufactured in volume for small consumer applications. But as battery life gets better and the silicon used in processors gets cheaper, many believe products like Dynastream's will revolutionize the way people live their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dynastream said it will now focus on promoting its technology for use in markets such as video gaming, smart prosthetics, mapping and security.

But the kit is in the news once more - not for another heroic victory by the sterling team who wear it, but because Manchester United have just signed a deal with the American sportswear company \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 9/10

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Commercial savvy, certainly. The deal will net the club about Pounds 300 million, which is a load of lucre by anyone's standards. And it adds up to what football commentators call a big war chest - enough money to keep the club well stocked with fresh new talent - assuming that those meddlesome regulators in Brussels don't succeed in abolishing the transfer fee system. 9/10 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Compassion
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Not enough to get in the way of good business sense. For what's good news for Manchester United's shareholders is not good news for Umbro, the Manchester-based sportswear company that has manufactured United's kits for the past eight years. The Women's Institute might want us all to Buy Local, Buy British, but that cuts no ice at Old Trafford. 6/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sex appeal
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In Umbro, in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or in a Gucci suit off the field, there is no shortage of eye-candy at Man Utd. David Beckham would look good in a grass skirt. But perhaps the new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  design (making its debut at the start of the 2002/3 season) could go for short, tight little shorts (not unlike hotpants) a la Seventies. It is such a shame for these boys to be hiding their lights under a bushell. 9/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Humour
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is no laughing matter. Not if you are Umbro, surely. They must be rueing the day. 4/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Family Values
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fairly expensive. Right now the "home infant kit" that your son demands every birthday will set you back the best part of 30 quid, and it is hardly likely to get any cheaper, is it? 7/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Antecedents
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The previous record deal for a football kit was for Brazil's national team, which was $ 100 million over a ten-year period. The Manchester United deal is worth three times more. 9/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Durability
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even if Man Utd has a disappointing few seasons (hard to imagine, true, but think of Liverpool, just down the road - stars in the Keegan years, but slightly lacklustre until recently) the deal is for 15 years. Smart move, that. 9/10
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Ambition
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Loads of it. Clearly this is all about securing the club's long-term financial security and super-club status. 9/10

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANCHESTER United, the world's richest soccer club, reported yesterday they had signed a sponsorship and merchandising deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worth more than $827 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  United, who have won the English league title six times in the last eight years and were European champions in 1999, said they would grant exclusive rights to sponsor their gear, manufacture and sell merchandise and operate Manchester United's existing retail operations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The agreement starts on August 1, 2002, when the club's current sponsorship contract with Umbro expires and will run for 13 years, although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will have the option to end the deal in 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Meanwhile, Alex Ferguson said his current deputy Steve McClaren was ready to take over as coach of Manchester United when the Scot steps down in 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not my decision but I think that the credentials are there. Steve's at the stage when he can make a step like that," Ferguson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  McClaren, appointed last week as England's joint caretaker manager was put in charge for United's 3-0 League Cup victory against Watford.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE television commercial that made golf cool almost never happened.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was in June last year when Tiger Woods was asked to make an ad for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a private course in Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In between takes on the fairway, the golfer amused himself and entertained the film crew by nonchalantly bouncing a golf ball off a sand wedge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The producers of the commercial were amazed at the feat and the original script was discarded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A few months later TV viewers worldwide were marveling at the sight of Woods juggling a ball on a narrow club head while moving the club behind his back and in between his legs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a finale, he effortlessly chipped the ball up to chest height and hammered it down a fairway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even those who had never visited a golf course could not help but be impressed by the dexterity and skill of Eldrick "Tiger" Woods. An icon was born.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since that time, he has won both the United States and British Opens and completed the game's grand slam, transforming himself from golfing celebrity to one-man golfing industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He has become the most influential figure in world sports, an inspiration to millions, the new Mohammed Ali, the new Michael Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Over the next years and decades, Woods' earning power will dwarf all those before him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Last month ESPN Magazine projected that Woods' lifetime earnings, including prize money and sponsorships, could  reach $US6 billion, with three-quarters of the money supposedly coming from product endorsements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If Woods is the master of the art of golf, then \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  founder Phil Knight is the genius of the science of sports marketing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The sportswear company, based in Portland, Oregon, decided to give Tiger a $US40 million five-year-contract, just on the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  strength of his early performances after he turned professional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Many industry observers thought \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was insane to offer him such a deal. At the time, golf accounted for only 2% of the company's sales and Woods was far from a star.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Even after he won the US Masters in 1997, the Tiger Woods phenomenon was still not a sure thing. A range of colourful clothing released at the time, carrying Tiger's moniker, failed dismally.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Traditional golfers were not prepared to don Tiger's radical designs. The black kids of Detroit were not about to swap their Jordan air shoes and basketball shorts for golf slacks. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was struggling to get a foothold in the golf merchandise market. There had to be another way. There was.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  At the end of last year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  began a new campaign, targeting Woods' golf products toward a high-end customer. It was a big success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf business grew from an estimated $US200 million two years ago to $US300 million this year. The company also developed its own golf ball. Woods switched to using the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  golf ball in June and shortly after won the US Open by a record margin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Until then \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had enjoyed little success in its attempts to break into the golf ball market, controlling just 1% of the $US1 billion business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Now the company predicts a 10% share within a couple of years, won at the expense of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  competitors. It is also selling Tiger Woods golf shirts, clubs and carry bags as fast as it can have them made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Just to ease the burden of any guilt the young golfer may feel over switching from using Titleist balls, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased his five-year contract from $US40 million to $US90 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He also has deals with American Express, Rolex, Buick cars, Wheaties cereal and Electronic Arts, which makes a golfing video game with the Tiger image.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods' career income from tournaments -- $US20 million, including $US5 million this year so far -- is starting to look paltry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clearly considers its money well spent and with justification. The company's share price, once in the doldrums, is close to $50 on the New York stock market, with a $10 rise since Woods' recent victories. The Woods effect, on paper at least, has added more than $2 billion to the value of the company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Little wonder that Mark McCormack, the chairman of the International Marketing Group, says Woods was a pioneer in professional sport "in the spirit of Bill Gates".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Before his victories in the US and British Opens, Tiger Woods' father Earl estimated he could be earning $1.5m per weekend for sponsored appearances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Woods has shown repeatedly that money is not his top priority. He refused to take part in US television advertisements recently out of solidarity with an actors' strike. He devotes much of his free time to the Tiger Woods Foundation, touring at his own expense holding golf clinics for young, often disadvantaged children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He has not yet turned 25 and Woods appears to have done the impossible -- making golf cool to young people. In the process he has broken down the sport's crusty image as a pursuit for red-faced middle-aged white men, wearing bad clothes and struggling with expanding waistlines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After the victory in last month's US Open, the president of the NBC Sports television company, Dick Ebersol, said Woods had completed the last step in a process to join Ali and Jordan as "the only athletes in the TV generation to be larger than life".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The British Open victory, making Woods the youngest holder of all four major golf championships, only added to his status.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger has no opposition, only a field," wrote George Vecsey in The New York Times. "Ali had Frazier. Navratilova had Evert . . . Tiger has only himself and his caddie and his touch and his inner light, but that is enough."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A generation of Tiger Woods disciples, young urbanites (particularly from minorities) and increasing numbers of women, are coming to the game for the first time. Even fashion companies such as Gucci, Prada and Tommy Hilfiger -- which once regarded golf as anti-fashion -- are jumping on the bandwagon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Michael Caruso, editor in chief of Maximum Golf, a new monthly magazine, says Woods' appeal is universal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "As golf has gotten younger, with the advent of Tiger Woods, it has also gotten sexier," he said. "For the first time, 57% of players are under 40. Younger men don't have the gender barriers that older guys have, the ones who are usually playing to escape their wives. There's a lot more flirting out on the course. People are finding golf sexy." Jordan, Pele, Ali and Tiger Woods are among only a handful of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 athletes who would be instantly recognised anywhere in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods is eager not to over-saturate the market. He says he is content with what he has got.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I don't get the feeling Tiger or his management team wants or needs more endorsements," said Rick Burton, chairman of the James Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon. "He could have 20 or 30 sponsorships by now but they would blur together."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The rise of Tiger Woods the businessman has followed his new-found confidence on and off the course.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This new spirit is put down to his girlfriend, the shy Joanna Jagoda, 22-year-old daughter of a Polish immigrant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The couple live together at his palatial $5 million estate in Orlando, Florida, where they shun nightclubs and wild parties, preferring to enjoy the company of friends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Jagoda's new home with Woods is a long way from her modest upbringing in the run-down fringes of the unfashionable Los Angeles suburb of Encino.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In high school, with her sun-streaked blond hair, long legs and movie-star smile, she was a cheerleader. She went on to the University of California, Santa Barbara, to study political science.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She met Woods on a blind date three years ago, organised by one of her college friends. She knew nothing about golf, let alone the increasing popularity of her date.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The relationship grew slowly. Between tournaments, Woods' limousine was often seen outside her parent's two-bedroom home in LA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Joanna had planned to go to law school when she decided instead to throw in her lot with the Stanford University-educated Woods and follow him around the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Friends said Woods' recovery from his post-Masters slump was largely due to Jagoda.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Tiger made a 180 turn-around with his life," a friend said. "Gone were the wild nights in glitzy discos, dancing with sexy bar bimbos until the wee hours. He realised the bar scene only brought him groupies and gold diggers and quickly tired of it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Like her famous boyfriend, Jagoda shuns casual contact with strangers, particularly those from the press. There are more photographs of Woods hugging and kissing trophies than of him showing her affection. When together in public, they are surrounded by bodyguards. There have been reports of death threats over their inter-racial romance. (He calls himself "Calibasian," a mix of Caucasian, African-American, American-Indian and Asian.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Woods says he warned Jagoda about the media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Unfortunately, it is an intrusion in our lives and it's very tough to handle at times, especially since she didn't cause any of it," he said. "I'm in the spotlight and they're trying to get to me through her."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While the couple are inseparable, rumours of an engagement infuriated Woods earlier this year. He does not want to rush in to marriage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "It's not true," he said. "I'm here to tell you that right now. Let's put an end to this crap."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The local chapter of the Screen Actors Guild picketed a production at Screen Gems Studios this week. The members said the action was to protest a Weiden & Kennedy shoot for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Studio representatives said only that the shoot was not a commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The SAG issue is a national issue," said Gerald Waller, vice president of studio operations. "We strongly support the First Amendment. At the same time, we're business as usual. We support SAG and we support our clients." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The picketing on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday didn't disrupt the production.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This was just to let them know we know they were there," said Patti Pocsik, Carolina Regional representative for the union.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began a strike May 1 against the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers. At issue is "pay-per-play" for commercials for cable television (where performers are paid every time an ad airs) and commercial use on the Internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This week's picket was the second local action in the strike. The first was on the set of a Bristol-Myers Squibb commercial on May 24.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ***
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fireworks flying over downtown Wilmington on Sunday were courtesy of the Summer Catch production. The display was part of an Almost Done with Filming Party at the Reel Cafe in downtown Wilmington. The film is scheduled to wrap Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ending of filming means, unfortunately, that actors such as Freddie Prinze Jr., Jessica Biel, Marc Blucas (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Brian Dennehy, Matthew Lillard, Wilmer Valderrama (That '70s Show) and Fred Ward, will no longer be out and about in Wilmington and Southport.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ***
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Filming of The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, though, may help fill the void left by Summer Catch. The feature, starring Jodie Foster, has been filming in and around Wilmington since May 24. The film is being produced by Ms. Foster's company, Egg Pictures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ***
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are a bevy of choices this month for local actors who yearn for roles in independent features. There are three -- yes, three -- local projects holding auditions in the weeks ahead.Auditions for Trusting Jack are scheduled to continue Saturday and Sunday at the Coast Line Convention Center in downtown Wilmington. They'll be held from noon to 6 p.m. in the Measurement Inc. offices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The film, written and directed by Melissa Page Jones, is about a woman who must learn to deal with the abuse inflicted on her by her father. Producers are looking for people of all ages to play principal actors, one-liners and extras. Those interested are asked to bring a headshot or other picture and must be prepared to read from a script. The film is scheduled to begin filming July 31 in the Southport/ Oak Island area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another project, Ball of Wax, is billed as a dark drama about a fictional pro baseball team. The film is the latest project by Daniel Krause, director of 1998's Jefftowne. Auditions will be held 1-4 p.m. Wednesday and 7-10 p.m. June 21 at the Community Arts Center. There are roles for men ages 22-65 and women ages 16-35. Filming should begin in October in Wilmington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And finally, there's Ding-a-ling-less -- the story of an emasculated man by filmmaker Onur Tukel. There will be auditions held the last three weekends in June.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Boys between the ages of 6 and 9 are needed as are adults of all ages. Those interested are asked to call 763-7554, 397-0333 or 762-6619 to schedule an appointment. Also, headshots can be sent to Ding-a-ling-less, 403 South 5th. Ave. Apt. B, Wilmington, N.C. 28401.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Instead of being stuffed with major college prospects, it now has three. Instead of pummeling every opponent, it has shown its vulnerability by losing two games.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Rice High School of Manhattan (10-2) is still the team to watch in Saturday's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Super Six tournament at Madison Square Garden. The Raiders, ranked 12th in USA Today, take on the 6-2 St. Patrick's of Elizabeth, N.J., in the last game of a triple-header pitting New Jersey schools against New York schools. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's just taking us a longer time to get used to each other, guard Andre Barrett of Rice said yesterday at a luncheon in Manhattan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Barrett, a point guard, has committed to Seton Hall. His teammate, forward Kyle Cuffe, has signed with St. John's. And Rice's other starting forward, Andre Sweet, is reportedly being courted by Duke.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the other games, Marist of Bayonne, N.J. (1-5) plays the Westchester powerhouse Mount Vernon (8-0) and St. Anthony of Jersey City (6-2) faces Kennedy of the Bronx (12-2).   RON DICKER

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  LEEDS are heading for a massive cash windfall - with top sportswear firms bidding to give them a fortune for the shirt off their backs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David O'Leary could even come in for an extra transfer fund boost in the summer as talks are advanced with at least one company.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The deal between Leeds and Puma runs out in the summer of 2001, but already the bidding war is on - with American giants \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Nike\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tipped to succeed.
