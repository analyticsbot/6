1,"NikeInc. yesterday named Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson to its board of directors.Thompson, aNikespokesman since 1980, becomes the first minority-race board member atNike, which expects $ 3 billion sales in sports and fitness shoes, clothing and accessories for its fiscal year ending May 31.&nbsp;The naming of Thompson follows criticism last July by Operation PUSH and its leader, Jesse Jackson, thatNikewas exploiting blacks and had none in upper management. In August, Operation PUSH urged a boycott ofNikeproducts, andNikepublicly said it would name a black to its board within a year. The next month, Thompson arranged a meeting in his office between Operation PUSH andNikeofficials.&quot;I've had an opportunity to know [Nikechairman] Phil Knight,&quot; Thompson said on a tape provided by Georgetown. &quot;I have a lot of interest and a lot of curiosity, particularly as it applies to the business world. And this will afford me an opportunity to expand my knowledge and at least give some more input of my feelings about the business world.&quot;Thompson will make $ 10,000 a year to sit on the board, plus $ 2,000 for each of six annual board meetings. His first board meeting is next month."
2,"&nbsp;Nikehas an unusual rival in the Barcelona Olympics: Juan Amigo Freixas, a Spanish lawyer who says he owns theNiketrademark in Spain.In 1981, Freixas bought this 1932 trademark from a knitwear manufacturer: a photo negative of the headless Winged Victory of Samothrace, a statue in Paris' Louvre Museum that has ''Nike''on its pedestal.&nbsp;That, he says, gives him theNiketrademark for apparel in Spain.Nikeprotested, but a Spanish civil court ruled otherwise, enjoiningNikefrom selling apparel there.Nikehas lobbied various U.S. government agencies and trade groups in a two-year legal battle and has appealed to the Spanish Constitutional Court - which might rule soon.Until then,Nikehopes for a reversal, or at least a ruling that doesn't broaden Freixas' claim beyond apparel. And, saysNikecounsel Lindsay Stewart, the company has made contingency plans: ''The obvious gift of a T- shirt wouldn't be included in our giveaways.''"
3,"NikeInc. filed a lawsuit today against L.A. Gear Inc., charging its rival with incorporating aNike-patented design in its new Catapult basketball shoe.The suit, filed in Federal District Court here, says some elements of L.A. Gear's Catapult cushioning system infringes twoNikepatents. The patents, covering whatNikecalls a &quot;spring moderator device,&quot; are not now used in the company's shoes. Instead,Nikehas an air-cushioning system that uses pressurized gas.&nbsp;LikeNike'sspring moderator, L.A. Gear's Catapult shoe has a cushioning system designed to improve the jumping performance of wearers.WhileNike,based in Beaverton, Ore., does not use its system on any shoe, Lindsay Stewart,Nike'sgeneral counsel, said it was important for the company to protect its designs. &quot;We spend a lot of money on research and development and we don't want to see it abused.&quot;An L.A. Gear spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment."

They'd be too expensive.''The ads will come from Made in the USA, a Chevy Chase, Md., foundation whose backers include labor unions and manufacturers. The group wants to call attention to its claim that 65,000 U.S. footwear jobs were lost in the 1980s. It plans to spend about $ 1 million on ads targetingNike,says chairman Joel Joseph.Nikeshoes are assembled in Asia. ButNike'sKidd says that shoe components are made in the USA, creating 1,162 full-time jobs inNike'sU.S. work force.Made in the USA saysNike'sAsian subcontractors pay Indonesian workers 14 cents an hour.Nike'scounter: That's four times the average local wage."
5,"He's in the World Series, but you haven't seen Deion Sanders'sNikecommercials during CBS broadcasts of the games - and you probably won't.That doesn't meanNikeInc. is fed up with Mr. Sanders, as many fans were after the seventh game of the National League Championship Series celebration, when he poured buckets of water on CBS sportscaster Tim McCarver, apparently in retaliation for some on-the-air criticism.&nbsp;Nikestill stands behind Mr. Sanders, a Braves outfielder and a Falcons cornerback whomNikepays $ 1 million a year to endorse its cross- training sneakers. His commercial just ran out its two-month cycle,Nikesaid.&quot;He had a rough week,&quot; said company spokesman Dusty Kidd of the McCarver controversy and of some fans' criticism that Mr. Sanders is more concerned about hisNikedeal - which pays him an extra $ 900,000 a year to shuttle between the Braves and Falcons - than he is about the Braves winning the World Series.&quot;But he's still a .300 hitter, he still had the most triples in the [National] league, and he's still an All-Pro cornerback,&quot; said Mr. Kidd. &quot;In some people's minds, maybe [the controversy] does tarnish him. But we stand behind him.&quot;"

8,"&nbsp;NikeInc. of the U.S. expects to report relatively flat earnings in its second fiscal quarter ended Nov. 30, says chairman Philip H. Knight.A year earlier, the sports shoe and apparel maker earned US$58.1 million (C$66.4 million), or US77 cents a share.&nbsp;Knight indicated thatNike'sper-share earnings for the recently completed second quarter ranged from US75 cents to US80 cents.In recent years,Nikehas commonly reported big quarterly earnings jumps, but a flat second quarter would be something of a victory in these recessionary times.Knight declined to give specific estimates and didn't discuss revenues for the period. A year ago,Nikehad revenues of US$648.8 million. Knight's comments indicate thatNikewill earn roughly between US$57 million and US$61 million for the fiscal second quarter.In the fiscal first quarter,Nikeearned US$114.4 million (US$1.50 a share) on revenue of US$947.2 million. Fiscal first quarter earnings were 15% above profits in the year-earlier first quarter."
9,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NikeInc., which paid millions to put its name on the U.S. track and field team's uniforms at the Barcelona Olympics, is appealing a stunning high court decision that bars the advertising or sale ofNikeapparel in Spain, a company attorney said yesterday.Spain's Constitutional Court last week refused to lift a lower court order prohibiting the Beaverton, Ore.&nbsp;-based company from using theNikename on clothing because a Barcelona firm registered the trademark first in 1932.&nbsp;Nike, whose shoes are not affected by the ruling, planned to use the Olympics promotional campaign to launch a new line of sports clothes.If further legal actions fail - and if the courts rule the injunction bars U.S. athletes from wearingNikeuniforms - the firm stands to lose US$20 million in sales in Spain alone and many times that sum worldwide.''We do not believe we've lost the battle by any means, much less the war,'' said John Faylor,Nike'sEuropean lawyer.But the decision clearly leftNikeat a disadvantage in its long-running dispute with Juan Amigo Freixas, the Barcelona lawyer who bought theNikename from the original registrant, who briefly made socks during the 1930s.Amigo has reportedly askedNikefor US$30 million for rights to the brand, according to Faylor, who has called the Spaniard a ''pirate.''&nbsp;Nike, however, claims the decision won't keep athletes from wearing its name when the Games open on July 25 because the International Olympic Committee does not consider the uniforms to be a form of advertising or promotion."
10,"NikeInc. has countersued Avia Group International Inc., contending that the shoemaker is making shoes that useNike'ssole-cushioning technology. Bill Dragon, Avia's president, denied the contentions, accusingNikeof &quot;typical arrogance.&quot; Avia, based in Portland, had suedNikelast month for infringing patents for its Cantilever sole, a system in the concave sole that directs the shock of impact away from ankles and knees. Avia seeks to block sales ofNikeAir 180 running shoes, which it says copy the Cantilever technology. Avia is also asking for unspecified damages.In its counterclaim,Nike,No. 1 in the athletic footwear industry, contends that Avia abandoned its original Cantilever outsole, rendering the patent invalid. The company, based in Beaverton, outside Portland, further contends that Avia products infringe twoNikepatents. Avia is owned by Reebok International Ltd."

He's living with former Tech and now Detroit Pistons forward John Salley in Detroit and is managing a nightclub partially owned by Salley.PICTURE THIS: Tulane coach Perry Clark never saw his junior guard, G.J. Hunter, play high school ball in person, but was so impressed with the film of one of Hunter's games, he sent assistant Ron Everhart to Garland, Texas, to sign him. Not to imply that it was a mistake, for Hunter is a starter for the Green Wave but the film was not of one game, as Clark thought. It was a highlight film of an entire year's worth of games compiled by Hunter's father.WHERE'D THEY GO: Kansas City baseball reporters will hold their awards dinner Saturday.

Earlier yesterday, Oregon-basedNikereported first-quarter net income of US$114 million (C$130 million), or US$1.50 a share, on revenues of US$947 million, compared to 1990 first-quarter income of US$99.7 million, or US$2.62 a share, on revenues of US$833.6 million.&nbsp;Nikesaid first-quarter results benefited from a big increase in ''at-once'' sales.

In a telephone conference call with analysts,Nikeofficials said it is unlikely ''at-once'' sales will reach that level in the second quarter.Nikesaid the first quarter's record revenues and earnings reflect growth in all its brand divisions and other brands. Domestic footwear revenues increased 5% to US$558.3 million, while domestic athletic apparel grew 24% to US$98.6 million over last year. International sales rose 37% to US$248.3 million over last year, while revenues from other brands, such as Cole Haan and Tetra Plastics, rose 8% to US$42 million."
