</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's the rhythmic thump of a basketball on a gym floor and the whack . . . whack . . . whack of a tennis match. Tropical fish glide behind a clear wall while, elsewhere, a tennis racket personally ruined by John McEnroe is displayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, of course, the shoes. Running shoes. Tennis shoes. Basketball shoes. Golf shoes. Hiking shoes. Wrestling shoes. Soccer shoes. Shoes that bristle with static energy, shoes that gleam under spotlights, flanked by racks of lycra clothing in neon and black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds, sights - and products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just Do It.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, America's new kid on the retailing block that blends '70s Disco decor, straight-up '80s consumerism with '90s marketing savvy into a virtual reality shopping experience aimed at people with bucks who like to hum when they cruise the aisles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds, images, colors and computers converge here in a store devoted exclusively to sports and an atmosphere that puts the shopper in the starting block, on the 14th tee or slam-dunking with the scoreboard showing 112-111.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or reaching for their wallets and purses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just Do It.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people do like to shop and when they shop, atmosphere is important,&quot; says store manager Mary Burns, a mid-Westerner with a strong merchandising resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, Tom and Donna Sunderland, up from Stockton, Calif., flip through the racks, their tanned faces glowing at the goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This store,&quot; says Tom, &quot;is just the greatest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Donna: &quot;I felt like jogging after being in here for only a few seconds. It really pumps you up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, opened last November by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., is retail theatre, one of those things only the U.S. of A. would do, or want to do - meaning it's risky and expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But doubts that the entire exercise is just a doomed, dippy marketing balloon dissolve, somewhat, when Burns pulls out some figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent Saturday in August, 5,000 people went through the store. It has a capacity for 350 shoppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She calculates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town draws at least 30,000 customers a week, or about 150,000 people a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It opened Nov. 21, so let's say 1.5 million people to date have trooped through Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's 1.5 million through a store that is only 4,570 square metres (15,000 square feet).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lineups to get in here are not uncommon and the store has become a major tourist attraction for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's finally put Portland on the map,&quot; declares Sandy Macomber, librarian at the Oregonian newspaper a few blocks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesssssss!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. was founded by Phil Knight (a middle distance runner) and Bill Bowerman (his coach). It is the biggest sports and fitness company in the U.S. with net profits in 1989 reaching $ 167 million. They've sold five million pairs of Air Pegasus, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running shoe, alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s world headquarters were established in the nearby Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1979. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (rhymes with Mikey) is the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh curve in the trademark was designed by a Portland State University student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmie Connors won the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In 1983, Jean Benoit shattered the women's world marathon time wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan made them a cult shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it follows, treats sports and shoes very, very seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of years ago </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decided that it wanted to build a store that would represent their collections or their sports categories the way they designed and developed them,&quot; says Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the concept emerged the town - resist the temptation to call it Smelly Runnerville - a two-storey, 4,570-square-metre store in downtown Portland. For Lower Mainlanders, it is about a seven-hour drive south down the I-5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town was to merchandise footwear, apparel and accessories - 95 per cent of what is in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> catalogue is on display in the store - not just to consumers, but to retailers as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, Burns said, was supposed to be fun and so unique in retail, &quot;that it was more than just a store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than just a store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's say you want to buy a wet suit for sailboarding. At </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town you stroll to the Aqua Gear pavilion, the name for each area selling a different sports product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, you see the tropical fish. At your feet, a multi-screen image - on the floor! you can walk on it! - depicts scenes of rippling water. The background music is the sound of rushing water, virtually real. You can hear the water, if not the cash register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The uniqueness of the atmos-phere of each sports category is felt when you walk in,&quot; says Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The products sit on a surfboard shelf. The salesperson will be a sailboarder, dressed in sports gear, who will push a few IBM computer buttons to check the inventory and order your purchase, which is delivered smoothly via large acrylic tubes from the basement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no disappearing act by the salesman to find the goods. They remain with the customer, discussing the product, signing them up for the next sailboarding competition or just chatting about the latest sports scores. It's called schmoozing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Thompson was hired by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. as creative director of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town. For inspiration, he visited the stage set of the movie Back to the Future, which based a lot of its action around a town square. He'd also visited many older European towns. Ditto, town squares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town includes maybe a dozen pavilions linked by a common area, an elevator and a catwalk. A two-storey town was born. The entrance and passageway lighting was kept Nightclub Dark, with each pavilion becoming an oasis of bright lights, a palette of color and products - moving the shopper from dark to light. Get it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the merchandise, the layout and the sound track, a museum element was introduced to entice shoppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can gaze at a basketball signed by Michael Jordan or Nolan &quot;Tex&quot; Ryan's shoes and hat. Sports heros like Bo Jackson or the Portland Blazers visit the store to autograph equipment or offer advice, all adding to the sports aura, all bringing shoppers through the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town as an &quot;event&quot; rather than a retail centre carried the risk that people will look, rather than buy. It was a risk that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, competing with the likes of Adidas, Reeboks, LA Gear and Brooks, could accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Burns: &quot;We didn't know on day one when we opened if there would be a line of people at the door. We didn't know if people would find it interesting. But the first two weeks we had lines a block long to get in the store. We couldn't get everybody in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now I would say that every Sunday morning now, there are at least 70 people outside the front door, waiting to get in. It's amazing. We are a tourist attraction, people bring their cameras to take pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't release any sales or dollar figures, but Burns says, &quot;we are definitely meeting our expectations in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One indication that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town is approaching black ink came when the company announced it will open another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town in Chicago, a 50,000-square-foot store, next May and plans additional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towns for New York and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less enthusiastic about such retail theatre is Toronto retailing analyst John Winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to realize that the sports shoe market has become very competitive. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can get an edge by selling through an attractive outlet. That's fine. If you can get an edge, it's fine for a year or two. Concept retailers have a very short shelf life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of distractions, from salesgirls wearing shorts to music and atmosphere and all that. They all detract from the fact that it's $ 150 US you're paying for shoes made in the Phillipines by someone paid 75 cents an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's merchandising. Brilliant merchandising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town is also aimed at retailers who visit the store to draw ideas from the racking, the presentation and the concept they can then apply to their own stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't advertise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, relying on word-of-mouth and media stories to do the rest after it trumpeted the official opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main reason is other retailers sell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products too and our intention is not to compete with them but to help and enhance the business totally. If Footlocker or Nordstrom wants to run the same product we have at 20 (per cent) off, that's good, that's okay, that's their business. We're here just to enhance what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is all about,&quot; says Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this the wave of the future? Well, it's a combination of design and merchandising, but also service. We've heard that over and over again. We went from a very service-oriented retail environment many years ago to self- service to 'wait a minute, people still really want service' especially with price points and technical products, they deserve to know why this costs what it costs and in order to do that, you have to service the customer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town is aimed squarely at middle and upper-income campers who don't flinch at a $ 360 US price tag for a Goretex running suit or at $ 225 US Air Super Dome AC6 hiking boots or $ 150 US Air Force 180 basketball runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues to operate a factory outlet seven kilometres away from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, where prices are 20 to 30 per cent lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, says Burns, is for the customer, &quot;who wants the atmosphere, wants the design and wants to be able to say, 'I bought it at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Shannon, director of retailing for Ernst Young in Vancouver, observes that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town typifies the polarization of retail stores in North America into either discount, bare bones-type stores or high end, service-oriented, experience-oriented outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It fits in well with that as an over-all trend,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;And as far as demographics are concerned, people are demanding more from retailers and expecting more. As we age we get crankier and more demanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you buy it at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, you may buy it from Ethan Egan, a twentysomething salesman and former Nordstrom salesman who jumped at the chance to work at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> classes in product knowledge before the store opened so we were all primed for opening day,&quot; says Egan, who pointed out the store's features during a stroll through each pavilion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He jogs and plays soccer, skills that he uses daily in talking to customers. &quot;I love it here,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he last took inventory, Keith Goodie, a University of the District of Columbia basketball player, owned 56 pairs of top-of-the-line sneakers, made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Adidas, New Balance, Reebok and Gucci, in colors that included red, white, black, gray, green, blue, brown and gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's just me,&quot; Goodie said of the $ 4,000 he spent on sneakers last year. &quot;People tell me, 'Keith, man, you've got a pair of tennis shoes to match every jacket you wear.' I take it as a compliment. It's just me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's more than just Goodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once associated with games of youth, sneakers have become a cultural phenomenon, promoted by millionaire athletes and bought by fashion-conscious Americans who last year spent $ 11.7 billion on 393 million pairs of brand-name athletic shoes. The phenomenon is especially remarkable in that black inner city youths such as Goodie set the pace and styles for an industry managed mostly by white businessmen who sell the bulk of these products to white consumers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know anybody who doesn't have at least 20 pairs, just for dressing,&quot; said Goodie, 25. &quot;My 5-year-old son grows out of them so fast, I have to buy him four pair a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sneaker craze was spawned by the fitness boom of the 1980s -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took the lead through the signing of basketball star Michael Jordan as an endorser in 1984, the introduction of the Air Jordan shoe in 1985 and the airing of TV ads starring black celebrities such as Jordan and actor/filmmaker Spike Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revenues soared from $ 270 million in fiscal 1980 to an industry-leading $ 2.23 billion last year. But this classic American success story is about more than money: It is about marketing strategies and social responsibility, about what some see as sound business practice and others see as exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helena Jones, principal of all-black Roper Junior High in Northeast Washington, says sneaker companies target their advertising toward black children. John Thompson, basketball coach at Georgetown University and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consultant, says the companies' marketing strategies are questioned because so many of the endorsers are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones says demand for high-priced, high-tech sneakers drove some of her former students to sell drugs. Thompson says singling out sneakers is unfair because other luxury items are as coveted but do not face similar scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the black community, name-brands are a status thing,&quot; said Goodie's coach, George Leftwich, a black Washingtonian and former salesman for the Converse sneaker company. &quot;Yes, these are false goals. I don't know if low self-esteem is too strong, but for some reason people need to have visible importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in an interview in his downtown Washington office, said black endorsers such as Lee, the Chicago Bulls' Jordan and San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson are fueling the desires of children who can ill afford the $ 125 Air Jordan or (coming soon) the $ 160 Reebok Pump II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are exploiting an ethos of mindless materialism,&quot; Jackson said of the endorsers. &quot;Our youth are trapped with economic depression, with zero-based self-esteem: 'I am nothing. You are less. If you cross me, I will shoot you. For my inadequate feelings about myself I must at least identify with the best. So I cover up my inadequate feelings with $ 200 tennis shoes.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executives and endorsers reject Jackson's criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're promoting people who are real positive role models,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President/Marketing Tom Clarke. &quot;I mean, if we had [heavy-metal rock star] Axl Rose [as an endorser], would that be as good? Or is it better to have athletes who have to work hard to do well?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue is our value system, not the fact that Spike Lee or Michael Jordan advertise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes,&quot; said Thompson, who receives more than $ 200,000 a year as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consultant. &quot;Because people will also kill you for your jewelry. Should we blame the jewelry companies too? Ninety-nine percent of the motorcycle gangs are wearing crosses. Does that mean that churches should shut down?&quot; Who Buys What?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials say 87 percent of all their products -- including shoes, clothing and accessories -- are sold to whites. No racial statistics are kept on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball shoe sales because, Clarke said, &quot;We just target one group: People who love to play basketball and anybody else who is excited or finds a lot of emotional bonding with that activity.&quot; Clarke said 60 percent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball shoes are bought by people who do not play the sport, even recreationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visits to Washington-area shopping malls confirm that youngsters of all races are in the hunt for stylish basketball shoes. But buying patterns differ between blacks and whites, according to consumers and retail store employees interviewed in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the inner-city kids spend money, they'll buy the $ 130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Air Command Force] hightops, the $ 44 Champion sweatshirt and the $ 110 Starter hooded parka all at the same time . . . so you've got all the colors hooking up,&quot; said Vinny Vincenzes, head footwear buyer for Irving's Sport Shops Inc., which owns 19 stores in the Washington area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the [white suburbs] instead of the kids coming in, the parent will buy the shoes. Then maybe a month later the parent will get his kid the hooded parka. Then maybe for Christmas he'll buy the Champion sweatshirt. The [white] suburban kids don't buy product as fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buying patterns varied among youngsters interviewed on a recent afternoon at Champs sports shop at the Pentagon City Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Peine, a white 14-year-old, owns three pairs of sneakers, including Air Jordans. &quot;My parents give me half the money for my </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and I pay the other half,&quot; he said. &quot;I save money from doing chores around the house, selling old things at yard sales and saving the holiday money I receive from relatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milton Chan, a black 14-year-old, said his wardrobe includes 20 pairs of sneakers. &quot;I need them -- I really do -- because my shoes wear out so fast,&quot; he said. &quot;My money comes from a job at a seafood store. I make about $ 10,000 a year and probably spend $ 2,000 a year on [athletic] shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey Porter, Jr., a black 20-year-old, said he refuses to become a part of the sneaker craze. &quot;I have four pair and that's too many,&quot; he said. &quot;Black people spend too much money buying shoes. We need to get more into values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offers 22 men's and women's basketball shoe models, most in black and white with accent colors such as &quot;hot lava,&quot; &quot;pink flash&quot; and &quot;clockwork orange.&quot; The company also sends a &quot;special makeup&quot; model -- the Air Force One, which was introduced in 1983 and sells for about $ 80 -- to selected inner city stores. &quot;This shoe is strictly inner city,&quot; one Washington retailer said. &quot;It's not in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> catalogue, but it sells well among blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executives say they do not design sneakers with any ethnic group in mind. But Roy Yun, director of product development for Next Sports Inc., a new sneaker company affiliated with New York Knicks star Patrick Ewing, said he consults with young blacks and Hispanics in Brooklyn, upper Manhattan and the Bronx before designing a shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're the ones who are regularly open with their wallets to buy new items,&quot; Yun said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'brothers' set the trends . . . and the white kids slowly follow,&quot; Vincenzes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ethnic market . . . they buy quality,&quot; said John Morgan, basketball marketing director of Reebok International, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> major competitor. &quot;That's their statement. They want to make a first-class statement with everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sneaker fashion, colors are important. &quot;I buy sneakers so I can match their colors with my clothes,&quot; Goodie said. &quot;Tomorrow, if I wear a red Polo shirt, I might wear my red New Balance shoes. It's all about matching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also about status. &quot;I don't play in these shoes, I walk around in them,&quot; said UDC basketball player Henry Moton, 22, wearing a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Robinson Force shoes. &quot;You know, I just sport them, let people say, 'Whoa! He's got the David Robinson pump on.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kids wanting sneakers is no different than any banker or insurance person wanting to carry a Mont Blanc pen,&quot; said John Slahetka, a manager of Snyders In Step Shoes, Inc., which has three shops in Northeast and Southeast Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's difficult to explain why a particular brand, style or color gets hot. Or why, several years ago, sneaker chic meant wearing one's shoelaces untied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anything all-black is a guaranteed winner in the inner city,&quot; said Vincenzes. &quot;The Air Jordan that just came out in black sold out in two days. Purple also does well. But in the suburbs . . . the kids want whatever is being promoted and advertised as being the hottest. Colors aren't as important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very clear that black, inner city kids have a very different fashion sense from white suburban kids,&quot; said Wally Grigo, owner of three Connecticut stores. &quot;At my store that sells mostly to blacks, we sold 700 pair of Fila hightops during a seven-week period last year. We didn't advertise. It was all word of mouth. And not one of those shoes sold in our 99-percent white store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One difference between whites and blacks is that a lot of black kids won't wear dirty sneakers,&quot; said Kevin Lewis, 20, a black salesman at Athletic Shoe Box in Alexandria. &quot;If the shoes get a little dirt on them, kids will buy another pair. When I was in high school, the longest I had a pair was a month and a half. My shoes had to look fresh.&quot; Ethnicity and Economics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials say they do not target sales to any ethnic group, black dialect has been used in some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TV ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one spot, Mars Blackmon, the nerdy Spike Lee character, presses Air Jordan sneakers to each side of his head and says: &quot; . . . Yo Homes, Yo Homes, Yo Homes. . . . These sneakers be housin', housin' across the country . . . And every homeboy should be bum-rushin' to get some, get some.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman Phil Knight, in an interview at his sprawling headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., said the ad &quot;talks to the black athlete and inner city kids and to the white basketball player in the suburbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarke, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vice president, said white teenagers &quot;generally know what's happening&quot; in the ad. The word &quot;housin' &quot; he said, means the sneakers are &quot;moving,&quot; or selling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson said the ad is aimed directly at young blacks. &quot;First of all, it's clear that blacks do not refer to whites as 'homeboy,' &quot; he said. &quot;It's ethnic. It's targeted. You know, ghetto lingo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson said he is &quot;suspicious&quot; of people who say sneaker companies are targeting inner city youth. &quot;The minute black folks can capitalize on money, it becomes sinful for them to endorse shoes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, Knight was shown a glossy color photo in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1989 annual report that featured Jordan -- a tense look on his face -- modeling Air Jordan shoes and apparel in front of a grimy, graffiti-scarred brick wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight examined the photo and said: &quot;We wouldn't run that picture today because of certain sensitivities. But, I mean, basically, basketball has an enormous number of faces. It has an inner city face, a playground face, a country-road face, an Indiana face, the pro face. That was the inner city face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight added that the photo was seen by company executives and shareholders, not by the general public. &quot;The guys who get this annual report are institutions and, you know, white guys with money, really,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's Morgan said blacks are selected to appear in basketball ads because, &quot;Basketball is dominated by blacks and authenticity is really important. To have a basketball ad with all whites and Chinese doesn't make sense. Kids get turned off because it's not authentic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight said some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads featuring black athletes shouldn't be taken too literally. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mister Robinson's Neighborhood&quot; TV campaign, for example, David Robinson asks viewers if they know how to say &quot;kick some butt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'kick some butt,' we knew we were pushing it a little,&quot; Knight said. &quot;But that is the way people talk when they say, 'Okay, let's go get 'em.' It speaks to the youth.&quot; The Drug Equation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One outgrowth of the athletic shoe craze -- and a public relations nightmare for sneaker companies -- is the profits retailers and manufacturers earn, if unintentionally, from sales to gangs and drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a frustration: to see everything we're doing that's good and positive get derailed for something that is really, to some degree, out of our control,&quot; said Peter Ruppe, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marketing manager for basketball products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight said he refused to fill an order from a large retail company that had requested sneakers in new colors. &quot;Gangs have these color codes,&quot; he explained. &quot;When we understood that [the retailer] wanted colors to coincide with some gangs, we refused to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials said athletic shoes and apparel took their place in the drug culture in the mid-1980s, early in the sneaker boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the Washington area, drug dealers assemble wardrobes with as many as 100 pairs of sneakers, adopt shoe brands as nicknames, use athletic apparel to recruit pre-teenage runners and lookouts, accept stolen sneakers as payment from addicts and substitute the word &quot;sneakers&quot; for &quot;ounces&quot; in coded conversations, according to federal and District law enforcement sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I first encountered this during a raid in Los Angeles about six years ago,&quot; a Drug Enforcement Administration agent said. &quot;When we went into this dope dealer's house, he had over 100 pairs of sneakers in his bedroom. He had every color imaginable. At first I thought maybe he was also dealing in shoes on the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vincenzes, the Irving's buyer, recalled seeing suspected drug dealers in a national chain store where Vincenzes worked in 1987: &quot;They'd buy 10 pair of shoes at a time. I'd see 15-year-olds with a wad of bills that would choke a horse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, when a federal agent raided the house of a drug suspect in suburban Maryland, he found two closets full of sneakers, many with price tags still attached. &quot;Your mid- to upper-level drug dealers use sneakers as a recruiting tool,&quot; one narcotics officer said. &quot;Sneakers are status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sneakers retain their status in jails. &quot;On the streets, drug dealers equate status with the automobiles they drive,&quot; another DEA agent said. &quot;In jail, sneakers have the same structure. Since they're all wearing the same prison clothing, the better your sneakers, the more status you have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in court, some drug defendants make basketball shoes their footwear of choice. Former cocaine kingpin Rayful Edmond III wore sneakers to a sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court here last year. A basketball enthusiast, Edmond once named an adult summer league team that he coached &quot;Reeboks&quot; and outfitted his players in Reebok shoes and T-shirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a federal court trial here in 1989, prosecutors introduced into evidence 76 sneakers confiscated during the arrest of Melvin Butler, a Los Angeles Crips gang member and Edmond cocaine broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoes were such an unusual discovery, it was like Imelda Marcos's closet,&quot; said Cynthia Lobo, Butler's lawyer. &quot;It's the kind of thing that people say, 'Look, they're $ 200, $ 300 shoes. Where'd you get the money?' The government introduced this evidence to suggest to the jury that my client was a young black male who had so many tennis shoes.&quot; Lobo called the tactic &quot;racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruppe said gangs identify with name-brand sneakers because, &quot;They're extremely popular with youth regardless of whether you want to be in a gang or not. It's part of the culture. It's like: Hey, if I'm on a team, I wear what the rest of the team wears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Van Grack, who owns the three Snyders stores, said he will not turn away business from known drug dealers. &quot;Who is any retailer, no matter what product they're selling, to be the judge of how somebody made their money?&quot; said Van Grack, who is white. &quot;And then because of how they made their money, restrict them as to the product they can buy? That's prejudice. You can't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Snyders customer was Edmond, whose gang was linked to as many as 30 murders. Asked about the business he received from Edmond, Van Grack said: &quot;I'd have to say, you know, no comment because whatever I say in that regard is going to be perceived wrong. . . . No, we don't condone what he does. . . . Why ask the question? What's the difference?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grigo, the Connecticut retailer, focused national attention on this issue in 1989 when he displayed a sign in his front window that read: IF YOU DEAL DRUGS, WE DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grigo, who is white, said he put the sign up after suspected drug dealers -- most of them black -- were spending about $ 2,000 a week in his downtown New Haven store. That summer, Grigo said a sales representative from a major sneaker company told him, &quot;You've got to find your market niche. You're an inner city store. You've got to hook up the drug dealers.&quot; Grigo declined to name the company.  The Price of Looking Good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, drug dealers can buy sneakers from truck vendors who cruise narcotics strips. &quot;The hustlers like to buy straight out of the trucks because it would cost them money to leave The Strip,&quot; said a Washington Metropolitan Police Dept. narcotics officer. &quot;Sometimes I think they'd rather have a pair of sneakers than a place to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sasha Bruce Youthwork Inc., a Washington juvenile services organization, counselors speak of how 14-year-old crack dealers routinely wear top-of-the-line sportswear, how one teenager bought $ 80 sneakers with his mother's public-assistance check and how fearful parents buy their children big-ticket athletic apparel to discourage them from dealing drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 15-year-old juvenile offender, enrolled in a Sasha Bruce program, said he began selling crack cocaine as a seventh grader for one reason: &quot; . . . so I could have enough money to buy good-looking clothes and sneakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What troubles some inner city parents and educators is that drug dealers have become trendsetters to a larger community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Lewis, the Alexandria sneaker salesman, recalled the adulation drug sellers received at T.C. Williams High, where he was a student in the late '80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'd come in on a Monday morning with a brand new pair of sneakers,&quot; he said. &quot;The average kid would walk down the hallway saying, 'Man, I like those shoes. But, damn, I can't afford them.' Some kids idolize those types of human beings and they'll do anything to get the kind of clothes they're wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some large cities, muggings for sneakers and jackets are commonplace; murders for trendy athletic shoes and apparel also have occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chairman, said he became aware of sneaker-related violence in early 1988 when &quot;Spike Lee called and said, 'God dang, some kid just killed another kid for a pair of Air Jordans. That just drives me nuts. Here I am using my creative talents [to advertise Air Jordan] and this happens.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1990 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began airing &quot;Stay in School&quot; TV spots, starring Lee, Jordan and Thompson. That did not satisfy critics. New York Post sports columnist Phil Mushnick attacked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for continuing to air &quot;commercials with no conscience&quot; that urged &quot;tenement-poor kids&quot; to buy &quot;ripoff&quot; sneakers. In May, Sports Illustrated examined sneaker violence in a cover story headlined YOUR SNEAKERS OR YOUR LIFE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released a &quot;Mister Robinson's Neighborhood&quot; TV ad in which the 7-foot-1 basketball star tells his viewers: &quot; . . . Garbage is anyone who's into drugs. If you're into drugs, don't get into my shoes. Mister Robinson doesn't like garbage in his shoes. . . . &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most frequently aired ads send another message: Buy sneakers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Reebok and L.A. Gear spent $ 4 million for 2 1/2 minutes of advertising during this year's Super Bowl. Attitudes and Values</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sneaker business continues to grow, if at a slower pace due to the recession. Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman predicted in a magazine interview last year that by the mid-1990s, &quot;Kids will wear a different pair of sneakers to school every day, depending on their mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Helena Jones, the Roper principal, that's an unsettling thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until 1988, when she instituted a voluntary uniform policy at Roper, Jones said her students were obsessed with sneaker fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One kid would buy shoes and tell everybody how much he paid for them,&quot; she said. &quot;Then everybody would talk about how cool they were. And everybody had to have a pair. Then a month later, when that color went out of style, the kids would want another shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoe companies definitely gear this keeping-in-style thing to the black kids. Just look at who's buying these sneakers. I know the kind of clothing the white kids wear to school. They don't have a new pair of tennis shoes every month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones said the craze has eased at her school. &quot;Now about 95 percent of our 360 students are wearing uniforms,&quot; she said. &quot;And you don't hear them talk about sneakers anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jones has unhappy memories of the days when sneakers were the talk of Roper Junior High.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of good kids were lost to selling drugs during that time,&quot; she said. &quot;And for some, getting the latest clothes and sneakers is what drove them to sell drugs. What else does a seventh grader want? If you don't have the latest sneaker, you're out of style. You're square. You don't know what's happening. It's sad. But until we change our values, this will be the attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. will give Nevada-Las Vegas's Jerry Tarkanian, Georgetown's John Thompson and 54 other college basketball coaches endorsement contracts worth more than $ 4 million, top-of-the-line merchandise valued at $ 600,000 and invitations to a five-day, all-expenses-paid outing in Colorado Springs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As consultants to the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company, the coaches will make promotional appearances, offer suggestions on product improvement and distribute sneakers to their student-athletes. By wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products during televised games, athletes give the company visibility and presumably boost sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promotions executive Sonny Vaccaro has been paying &quot;sneaker money&quot; to college coaches for more than a decade. It's a marketing strategy that has made Vaccaro basketball's consummate insider; he says he has joined the Georgetown Hoyas and UNLV Runnin' Rebels for pregame meals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now L.A. Gear has taken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy a step further, hiring a sports agent, David Spencer, to negotiate contracts with 15 college coaches and youth basketball programs in 36 states. Youth league programs normally distance themselves from sports agents to avoid any suggestion that agents could use such associations to recruit clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials were not surprised when Spencer, director of client development for Management Plus Enterprises Inc., appeared on the scene. &quot;They're looking to strike Sonny,&quot; Vaccaro said. In the battle to dominate the $ 11.7 billion athletic footwear market, almost anything goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College administrators have long been concerned about the influence of shoe companies and the ethics of coaches serving as sneaker consultants. Today, these issues are being examined by the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, the NCAA's Presidents Commission and the National Association of Basketball Coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 19 the reform-minded Knight Commission -- named after the late newspaper publishers, John and James Knight -- likely will recommend to the NCAA that universities take over negotiations of sneaker contracts from coaches, said Kit Morris, the commission's staff director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the NCAA implements this proposal, universities will decide on a case-by-case basis how much sneaker money, if any, to give to their coaches. Payments now range from several thousand dollars to more than $ 200,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole issue raises very serious questions,&quot; Maryland President William E. Kirwan said. &quot;There are questions of conflict of interest. The whole image of a coach getting a large shoe contract. Players having to use a certain kind of shoes. Matters of ethics and appropriate compensation are all involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear is the third-largest athletic footwear company, after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok. Through Spencer, who declined to be interviewed for this story, L.A. Gear made an estimated $ 3 million in endorsement deals last year, ensuring that its products will be worn by more than 10,000 athletes, many of them present and aspiring high school and college stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This brings everything to a little different level,&quot; NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz said of the association between Spencer and youth league directors. &quot;It could be highly ethical and there could be absolutely no problems. But it needs to be observed very carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're looking at a tremendous potential for conflict of interest and abuse,&quot; said Morris, of the Knight Commission. &quot;At least the potential is there for bartering these athletes from a very early age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two youth league directors affiliated with L.A. Gear described Spencer as a highly ethical sports agent who would not solicit clients from among the athletes who participate in their programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An L.A. Gear spokesman, Howard Bragman, said the sneaker company hired Management Plus because &quot;it has an extraordinary reputation, very good contacts and very good knowledge&quot; of the basketball business. The Los Angeles-based agency's client roster includes Houston Rockets center Akeem Olajuwon, San Francisco 49ers safety Ronnie Lott and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. &quot;Is there any concern about a conflict of interest? Not at all,&quot; Bragman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer, a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Southern California, came to the agency in 1989. A youth league director who knows Spencer says his mission is clear: to become the next Sonny Vaccaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro, 51, a former high school teacher, sports agent and professional gambler, has heard charges from coaches and sportswriters that he has steered high school basketball stars to college coaches affiliated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Vaccaro said in a recent interview that he has entertained athletes in his home -- even given them sneakers -- but never recommended a school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro cringes when he is described as a power broker, as he often is. Then he talks about how in 1987 he had lunch with 6-foot-10 Alonzo Mourning (now at Georgetown) when he was off-limits to college recruiters; how in 1989 he helped arrange an NBA tryout for a then-troubled college athlete, Shawn Kemp; how he decides which coaches get lucrative </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contracts and which high schools get free </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have more access than anybody in America,&quot; Vaccaro said in the den of his Pacific Palisades, Calif., townhouse. &quot;I've traveled with John Thompson's teams the last nine years at the NCAA tournaments. I eat dinner with his team the night before. If and when Georgetown gets beat, I go to Georgia Tech and have dinner with their team. Or I go to Arizona. Last year at the Final Four I had dinner with Tark's team. So I do have access, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which makes some college administrators uneasy. &quot;There's a certain sanctity . . . something very special about being on the inside with a team,&quot; said Morris, a former athletics administrator at Harvard, Yale and Davidson (N.C.) College. &quot;It's not the kind of thing someone ought to be able to buy their way on to . . . to have that kind of proximity. You know, what makes Sonny part of that team?&quot; Business Administration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- named after the Greek goddess of victory -- was founded by a business administration professor, Phil Knight, and his former University of Oregon track coach, Bill Bowerman. From a fledgling company with sales of $ 1.96 million in 1972 -- Bowerman used his wife's waffle iron to develop a sole pattern that has become the industry standard -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a $ 2.23 billion multinational giant that spends upward of $ 120 million a year on advertising alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight (no relation to the Knight Commission founders) said his basketball shoe business, which had sales of $ 477 million in fiscal 1990 (runner-up Reebok grossed $ 218 million), grew as a result of innovative product development, imaginative advertising campaigns and promotions that have put the company's signature swoosh on athletes at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A $ 7 million basketball promotions budget -- spent on coaches' contracts, merchandise giveaways and sponsorship of summer leagues and camps -- supports youth programs that might not otherwise exist. And it guarantees high visibility for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TV has brought teams into everybody's homes, and the teams are being seen in our product,&quot; said Ed Janka, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promotions executive. &quot;Having the excellent coach or camp says that good people wear our product and hopefully the consumer will want to wear our product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro said it's an &quot;ego thing&quot; getting high school all-Americans into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The summer before his 12th grade year, Mourning said he preferred Converse shoes because, &quot;I wear sneakers that feel good to my feet.&quot; After attending a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-sponsored summer camp in Princeton, N.J., Mourning switched brands. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are a little better than any other shoe,&quot; he said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro said he received calls from Mourning every 10 days during his recruitment. &quot;We became friends,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;Alonzo asked me 15 times about different schools. I never recommended a school, but I didn't hide that John [Thompson] is a friend. Alonzo knew that. So maybe that helped Georgetown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Knight, 52, said he is less concerned with Vaccaro's friendships than with reports that youth league officials have used free promotional merchandise to recruit athletes from rival programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of all the criticisms that we've had -- paying college coaches, giving away shoes to high school kids, kids from the inner-city killing for a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes -- the one criticism that really was valid was our lack of controls in the summer programs,&quot; Knight said. &quot;We didn't object to giving products to these kids to play in the summer leagues. That's great. But when they [summer league officials] started using them for recruiting purposes, we didn't like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the college level, Knight said he cannot fathom why some administrators object to sneaker contracts. He said the deals result in free merchandise for athletic programs and reduce the university's financial burden to coaches. Some coaches, including Louisiana State's Dale Brown (L.A. Gear) and North Carolina's Dean Smith (Converse), donate portions of their earnings to university-related programs. &quot;Universities factor this into their budgets now,&quot; Knight said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Differences remain, however, on the ethics of a coach accepting as much as $ 200,000, as Thompson and Brown do, for handing out sneakers and making perhaps a dozen appearances a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've long felt that the sneaker company is buying the school [not the coach],&quot; said LSU Athletic Director Joe Dean, a promotions executive for Converse from 1959-86. &quot;I mean, they're buying UCLA, they're buying Georgetown. Because they want the team to wear the shoes to create the exposure. Coaches should get something.  . . . But I have to admit: Even when I was at Converse, I questioned whether a coach deserved to make all that money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shoe contracts are fine as long as they're owned by the university,&quot; the NCAA's Schultz said. &quot;Then if a university wants to pay a coach $ 500,000 or $ 600,000 [in salary and sneaker compensation], that's their business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morris said the Knight Commission has compared coaches' sneaker contracts to faculty consulting agreements. Morris's conclusion: there's no comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think there's anything wrong with a coach supplementing his income, but it should relate to talent and skills and working hard,&quot; he said. &quot;In faculty consulting there's brain power and energy going into product development to a far greater extent. With coaches it appears to be more of a reward for high-quality performance by their teams. It's not for splitting an atom or solving a specific problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As might be expected, coaches have little patience for critics such as Morris. &quot;How do they know we're not lending brainpower?&quot; said Maryland's Gary Williams, whose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deal is part of his university contract. &quot;We're pretty good experts on basketball shoes. I've been around basketball shoes for 35 years probably. . . . I definitely talk to shoe companies about the style of shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So all of a sudden it's sinful in this society for a person to be capitalistic?&quot; said Thompson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> highest-paid coach-endorser. &quot;But as long as I live in America, that's exactly what I'm going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Morris has little patience for such justifications. &quot;If that's what you're interested in, you might want to find work in the for-profit sector,&quot; he said. &quot;The last time I looked, colleges and universities were not-for-profit.&quot; The Big Sweep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonny Vaccaro may be the sultan of sneakers, but he didn't invent the sneaker promotions business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, Chuck Taylor, a World War I-era basketball player, barnstormed the country selling Converse's canvas Chuck Taylor All-Stars. &quot;Chucks,&quot; as they were known, were the basketball shoe of choice through the 1960s, when they sold for about $ 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back then, we'd give a free pair of shoes to a [college] coach or his wife or child,&quot; said Dean, who succeeded Taylor as Converse promotions boss. &quot;We'd do a lot of entertaining [of coaches]. We'd sponsor camps and seminars. But we didn't pay coaches and the teams had to buy their own shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late '60s, Adidas, the German manufacturer, began giving away sneakers to selected teams. Converse reluctantly followed, and by the mid-'70s Puma and Pro-Keds were paying college coaches, some as little as $ 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ecomonics changed in 1978 when Vaccaro -- already known to coaches as the founder and director of the Dapper Dan high school all-star game in Pittsburgh -- approached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told Phil Knight I could probably get him all the major college teams in the country,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;My theory was: There's nothing illegal about this. Just hire the coaches as consultants. Don't ever say that their teams had to wear the shoe. But, you know, these kids wear whatever the coaches tell them to wear. So pay the coach and give shoes to his team so his administration can't be mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro quickly signed 20 coaches to contracts that averaged $ 2,500. Suddenly, a company known mostly for its running shoes was being trumpeted by Tarkanian and Lefty Driesell. &quot;My kamikaze sweep,&quot; Vaccaro called his first round of signings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Dean said he resisted paying sneaker money until he was approached by Dean Smith and then-Kansas coach Ted Owens -- loyal but unpaid Converse endorsers -- at an NCAA Final Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'd been contacted by other companies,&quot; he said. &quot;So they asked what Converse was going to do. Their attitude was . . . if we did begin to pay, we needed to pay people like them. So we did. We began to compete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson -- another unpaid Converse endorser -- never received free shoes for his team or a contract offer from Dean. So when Vaccaro came calling in 1979, Thompson was only too happy to put the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swoosh on his Hoyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just walked in and made him such a tremendous offer that he switched overnight,&quot; Dean said. &quot;It was a great plum for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offer -- $ 5,000 -- wasn't exactly &quot;tremendous.&quot; But as competition among major sneaker companies increased, so did payments to coaches. In 1982, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave company stock to a dozen high-visibility coaches, including Thompson. &quot;They got very wealthy by the stock,&quot; Vaccaro said. Just how wealthy, Vaccaro would not say, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock has risen 1,000 percent from its price of just under $ 5 a share in late 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today 10 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coaches earn more than $ 100,000, Vaccaro said. Top programs also receive 135 pair of sneakers, 25 warm-up suits and 25 travel bags. And there's the annual outing for coaches and their spouses -- a $ 400,000 event, according to Vaccaro -- held in locales such as Hawaii, Bermuda and, this year, Colorado Springs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Thompson is the only guy who's never attended,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;John finds it hard to socialize with people who want to beat him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has their little picnic . . . they go to some very lavish, wonderful places,&quot; Thompson has said. &quot;Sonny loves that, and I've told him, 'That's the most idiotic thing: You get all those people [together] and they tell one another their business and out of that comes more damn gossip.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Vaccaro considers Thompson his most valuable coach: &quot;John is the most recognizable coach . . . the single most physical person in America. You recognize him because he's big, he's black, he's controversial, he's intelligent as hell. He isn't what some people want to think a black person is: illiterate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consultant, Thompson attends European trade fairs, appears in TV commercials, addresses the company's board of directors and advises Knight on issues ranging from shoe design to minority hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John has very strong ideas on product, and to some extent that doesn't help because his ideas are entirely different than everybody else's,&quot; Knight said, laughing. &quot;Basically he does give us certain thoughts. He's also just a great counselor in general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight does not seem fazed by L.A. Gear's foray into the basketball-shoe business. &quot;Everybody comes along and tries to buy their way into the market,&quot; he said. &quot;L.A. Gear's got a lot of money. But I don't believe that philosophy works by itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro said he rejected an offer last April to become L.A. Gear's promotions director. The shoe company turned to Management Plus, and within months Spencer had signed 15 coaches, including USC's George Raveling, the best man at Vaccaro's 1984 wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raveling, who was paid $ 50,000 by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, received $ 175,000 from L.A. Gear, an industry source said. &quot;You don't overthrow Sonny Vaccaro in one season,&quot; Bragman, the L.A. Gear spokesman, said. &quot;But we're very serious. If you want to be respected in performance [shoes] you've got to start grass roots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Parker, who directs a 50-city youth basketball program in Texas, said he was so grateful when Spencer offered his leagues L.A. Gear sponsorship, &quot;I asked him if I had to rename my firstborn after him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer also struck deals with Basketball Congress International, which operates youth leagues and tournaments in 36 states and four Canadian cities, the American Roundball Corp., which is represented in 29 states, and two California programs, Slam-N-Jam and Double Pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason we're involved in programs like this is obvious,&quot; Bragman said. &quot;You want to get kids used to wearing L.A. Gear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BCI director Larry Walker said dozens of present NBA players once competed in his 64-team Summer Prep tournament in Tempe, Ariz. A Phoenix bingo hall owner, Walker said he forsees no problems with an agent overseeing L.A. Gear's sponsorship. &quot;Spencer . . . no, hell,&quot; he said. &quot;He's a real nice fellow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARC President Rich Goldberg agrees. &quot;If I was dealing with [an agent] who was unethical, I'd be leery,&quot; he said. &quot;But I know David Spencer is ethical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARC, formerly funded by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has a $ 266,000 contract with L.A. Gear, which includes a $ 60,000 salary for Goldberg and $ 172,000 to purchase sneakers and athletic apparel at dealer cost. ARC serves more than 9,000 boys (8 years old and up), each of whom buy -- through a league entry fee -- one pair of L.A. Gear shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Spencer, Goldberg noted that the sponsorship will get &quot;numbers of traveling teams into L.A. Gear shoes and apparel at an early age.&quot; In another letter, Goldberg pledged that ARC coaches and players will &quot;strive to make L.A. Gear number one in the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, L.A. Gear is struggling: In the midst of a campaign to promote its newest basketball shoe, the Catapult, it recently reported fourth-quarter losses of $ 7.1 million. The Way It Goes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Knight Commission will continue to examine the sneaker issue even after it announces its first recommendations later this month, Morris said. Although some coaches are concerned about the influence of shoe companies on amateur athletics, they seem determined to keep their sneaker money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Harris Poll on behalf of the Knight Commission released last week, 61 percent of 75 college presidents said they favored coaches' outside income being controlled by universities. But only 19 percent of 75 college basketball and football coaches favored such an arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, it was okay for me in my first 15 years as a coach to make $ 28,000 total in salary,&quot; said Maryland's Williams, who has coached at American, Boston College and Ohio State. &quot;You know, it was a struggle sometimes. I was living in pretty affluent areas, not making the normal standard of living. And now because I make more money, people are upset. I don't quite get that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several years ago, Williams endorsed sneakers made by New Balance. Last year, he was with Reebok. This year, it's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all good shoes,&quot; Williams said. &quot;There are no fly-by-night companies offering shoe contracts. So what's the big deal? This is America. You work hard in your profession, try to develop some skills, then get rewarded. That's the way it goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff company filed a motion for summary judgment in regard to its claim for relief for collection of certain monies from one of the defendant corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The company brought an action against the corporations in regard to a certain subdistribution agreement. Thereafter, the court stayed the company's claim for relief for collection of monies against one of the corporations pending the bankruptcy court's determination of the company's motion to dismiss that corporation's bankruptcy petition. After the bankruptcy proceeding was concluded, the company filed a motion for summary judgment on its claim for relief. The company alleged that when the corporation agreed to provide a trustee with an annual payment of $ 50,000.00 on behalf of the other corporation in consideration of the subdistribution agreement, the one corporation assumed the other's debt. On ruling, the court denied the motion. The court held that the corporation had established that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the amount for which it was indebted. The court found that under the agreement the corporation was only obligated to make payments on behalf of the other corporation until the moment the agreement terminated, and that the parties never provided for a cumulative assumption of the debt in its formal agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JAIME PIERAS, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court has before it plaintiff </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Fourth Claim for Relief and defendant Venrod's Opposition thereto. Defendant Athletic Sales Inc. (&quot;ASI&quot;) is judgment proof and thus has not filed a response to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motion. On June 30, 1988, the District Court granted partial judgment by granting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> request for declaratory judgment, and stayed the plaintiff's fourth claim for relief for collection of monies, pending the Bankruptcy Court's determination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> motion to dismiss ASI's bankruptcy petition. On August 19, 1988, the Bankruptcy Court granted ASI's motion for voluntary dismissal, and entered judgment on October 25, 1988. As the bankruptcy proceeding is no longer pending, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on the Fourth Claim for Relief. For the reasons stated below, we deny the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">I. THE FACTS</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 29, 1979, BRS, Inc., the predecessor of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appointed ASI as distributor of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brands of athletic shoes, apparel, bags and related products in various parts of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. Thereafter, ASI started to experience financial difficulties. On February 7, 1984, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> renewed ASI's appointment as distributor with the condition that Venrod become its subdistributor, as ASI had already incurred a substantial debt to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The terms of the subdistribution agreement are at issue in this case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> required the appointment of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a trustee to ensure payment to all of ASI's creditors, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">1&nbsp;Even though the defendant has not complied with  [HN1] Local Rule 311.12 (Fed. Proc. Rules Service, District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, Rule 311.12) by neglecting to submit a separate statement of facts with its Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment; its delineation of the facts in its actual motion are sufficient enough for Local Rule 311.12 to be suspended pursuant to Local Rule 105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plaintiff alleges that when Venrod agreed to provide the trustee with an annual payment of $ 50,000.00 on behalf of ASI in consideration of the subdistribution agreement, Venrod assumed ASI's debt. The subdistribution agreement is alleged to have been a cumulative assumption of the debt. Defendant Venrod asserts that the subdistribution agreement expressly provided for annual payments of $ 50,000.00 for a period of seven years contingent upon the existence of the Distribution Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District Court found that the Distribution Agreement was validly terminated under Puerto Rico law, when ASI failed to provide </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with written notice of renewal as contractually required. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19"> Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 689 F. Supp. 1235 (D.C.P.R. 1988). In addition, the Court found that the Subdistribution Agreement expired on the same date as the Distribution Agreement, where the terms of the Subdistribution Agreement made clear that the existence of the Distribution Agreement was a condition precedent to the continuation of the Subdistribution Agreement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT -- STANDARD OF REVIEW</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN2] A motion for summary judgment is appropriate when: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  The pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Brennan v. Hendrigan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir. 1989); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">see e.g., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 896 F.2d 5 (1st Cir. 1990). A &quot;genuine&quot; issue is one that is dispositive, and must therefore be decided at trial.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Mack v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir. 1989); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986). A &quot;material&quot; fact is one which affects the outcome of the suit and must be resolved before attending to related legal issues. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Mack v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 871 F.2d at 181.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN3] Essentially, Rule 56(e) mandates that summary judgment be entered against a party who fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986). Thus, the burden is first on the movant, to show &quot;that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 477 U.S. at 325. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to establish the existence of a genuine material issue.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Brennan v. Hendrigan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 888 F.2d at 191. The nonmovant, however, cannot rest upon mere allegation or denial of the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the instant case, the defendant Venrod has established that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the amount for which it is indebted to plaintiff </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c9">III. CLEAR TERMS OF THE SUBDISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN4] Title 31 L.P.R.A. &sect; 3471 provides that &quot;if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">See also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Luce &amp; Co. v. Labor Relations Bd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 86 P.R.R. 402 (1962).  [HN5] Where contract terms and clauses are clear and unambiguous courts should abstain from speculating about possible intentions of parties and should interpret them according to their will expressed at the time of its execution. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">In re N-500L </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cases</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 517 F. Supp. 816 (D.C.P.R. 1981). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Contract construction should not be resorted to. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Salomons v. Leon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 P.R.R. 87 (1914); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Nat'l City Bank v. Martinez</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 41 P.R.R. 162 (1930). In this case, the Subdistribution Agreement which the plaintiff neglects to refer to, specifically states: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">12. In consideration of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22">NIKE's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> consent and approval of VENROD's becoming a sub-distributor for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> products, VENROD hereby agrees to provide the TRUSTEE, on behalf of ATHLETIC &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[*25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  SALES, whatever amount shall be necessary so as to secure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> a minimum payment of $50,000.00 per year for a period of seven years </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">contingent upon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> the Distribution Agreement continuing in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreement at 7 (Feb. 7, 1984) (emphasis added), Defendant's Exhibit B to Reply to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Fourth Claim for Relief. Thus, it is clear from the face of the Subdistribution Agreement that Venrod was only obligated to make payments on behalf of ASI until the moment the Distribution Agreement terminated, and that a cumulative assumption of the debt was never provided for by the parties in its formal agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff suggests that the Court rely upon an undated telex as evidence &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the parties' actual intent. Yet  [HN6] Puerto Rico law specifically provides that the terms of a valid contract must govern without references to extrinsic matters, in absence of express provision for such reference. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Chevremont v. People of Porto Rico</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 P.R.R. 108 (1903). Title 32 L.P.R.A. App. IV R. 69(B) states: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">When in an oral or written agreement, either public or private, all the terms and conditions constituting the true and final intention of the parties have been included, such agreement shall be deemed as complete, and therefore, there can be between the parties, or successors in interest, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">no evidence extrinsic to the contents of the same</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> . . .</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32 L.P.R.A. App. IV R. 69(B) (emphasis added).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the validity of the subdistribution agreement itself is not in dispute by the parties: the plaintiff's reference to extrinsic evidence, and arguments of subjective novation and cumulative assumption of the debt, are all without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherefore, in view of the foregoing, plaintiff </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby DENIED. The parties are hereby ORDERED to file a stipulation within 10 days of this Opinion and Order, of the amount of money Venrod may &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owe under clause 12 of the Subdistribution Agreement for unpaid installments to the trustee during the existence of the Distribution Agreement, and the amount for which ASI is separately indebted to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so that judgment may be entered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS SO ORDERED. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 22 day of March, 1991.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Cremins was paid more by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ($ 130,000) than he earned in&nbsp;salary as Georgia Tech's basketball coach ($ 105,000) in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest portion of Cremins's income - $ 162,878 - came from his&nbsp;television show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cremins's agreement with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consists of two parts - consulting and&nbsp;appearances on behalf of the shoe company. And because the Georgia&nbsp;Supreme Court ruled Cremins's personal appearances on behalf of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are&nbsp;not subject to the Open Records Act, the $ 130,000 does not include any&nbsp;income he might receive for those appearances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Frank Hull,&nbsp;which was upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court, Cremins maintained, &quot;I&nbsp;consider this disclosure of documents pertaining to his athletically&nbsp;related outside income an invasion of my privacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cremins's income does not include the value of perquisites such as&nbsp;the use of a luxury automobile, membership in the Indian Hills Country&nbsp;Club and health/life insurance, all provided by the athletics&nbsp;association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some stipulations in the five-year </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract Cremins&nbsp;signed on June 16, 1987:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- If Tech is put on probation by the NCAA which results in a&nbsp;prohibition of TV appearances, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can reduce the $ 130,000 annual&nbsp;payment to $ 65,000 during the probation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cremins receives up to $ 4,000 (wholesale value) in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;merchandise for use at his summer camps and clinics and up to $ 2,500&nbsp;(retail value) of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> merchandise for his personal use, plus &quot;such&nbsp;quantities of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball shoes as he may reasonably request for his&nbsp;own personal use.&quot; Three assistants each get $ 500 in merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Tech receives 135 pairs of shoes for the men's basketball team and&nbsp;one set of practice apparel for each team member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cremins agrees to &quot;make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes available to members of the&nbsp;Georgia Tech men's basketball team, to be worn during practices, games,&nbsp;clinics and other occasions in which team members wear basketball shoes.&nbsp;. . . shall describe to members of the team the advantage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;basketball shoes and suggest they wear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agrees not to advertise the fact Tech's team endorses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;products or &quot;in any other way advertise or indicate that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> athletic&nbsp;shoes are the official shoe' &quot; of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cremins agrees to advise Tech president Patrick Crecine and/or&nbsp;athletics director Homer Rice of the income he receives from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and to&nbsp;secure the administration's approval of the stipulations and approval&nbsp;that permission for the team to wear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has the right to terminate the contract if Cremins is&nbsp;convicted of a felony or &quot;publicly admits the use of cocaine or other&nbsp;illegal hard drugs specifically excluding marijuana ,&quot; if Cremins ceases&nbsp;to be head coach at Tech or another &quot;major&quot; Division I team or if the&nbsp;program receives a &quot;death penalty&quot; sentence from the NCAA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., which has been under fire from some blacks, named John Thompson, Georgetown University's head basketball coach, who is black, to its board of directors yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is one of the world's largest sellers of athletic shoes. Among its most enthusiastic customers are urban teen-agers, many of whom are black. Last year, Operation PUSH, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, charged that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not hire enough blacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledged to name a someone from a minority to its 11-member board within a year. Liz Dolan, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman, said that adding a minority member had been planned for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4,500 employees, about 8.5 percent are black, Ms. Dolan said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> based in Beaverton, Ore., markets shoes that are manufactured by independent contractors elsewhere, typically in the Far East, and does not, therefore, have a large factory work force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson's teams have been in every N.C.A.A. tournament since 1979 and the 1984 team won the N.C.A.A. national championship. He has been a consultant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since 1980 and has spoken at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sales meetings and coaches' clinics and made appearances to promote </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products in Europe and Asia, where they are less well known than in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also head coach of the United States 1988 Olympic basketball team, and is the second Olympic coach to join </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> board. The first was Bill Bowerman, co-founder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an Olympic track and field coach in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson was not in his office at Georgetown yesterday; a spokesman for the university said he was traveling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson, 49, is a member of no other corporate board. He will be paid the customary $10,000 annual director's fee and $2,000 for every bimonthly director's meeting he attends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While sales of many expensive athletic shoes have languished, those of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have continued to thrive, although at a slower pace than in earlier years. In the year ended May 31, 1990, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earned $243 million on annual revenue of $2.2 billion. Analysts said that in the year ending next week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robust foreign sales would help lift revenue past $3 billion and earnings close to $300 million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside a suite in New York City's Grand Hyatt hotel, three of America's most celebrated black sports and entertainment figures were trying to make peace with Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil rights organization. Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson was there. So was actor/filmmaker Spike Lee. And Chicago Bulls all-star guard Michael Jordan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three celebrities gathered on a Sunday evening last September as paid representatives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company. Their mission: End the boycott PUSH had called against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to protest its minority hiring and business practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was scheduled after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman Phil Knight failed to satisfy PUSH during a widely publicized session in August on the Georgetown campus. &quot;It was John Thompson's idea,&quot; Knight said of the New York meeting. &quot;I was complaining to John that we weren't getting anywhere in negotiations. John's line to me was, 'You think too much like a white man. Let me go negotiate with them.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the negotiations failed -- and the two sides haven't met since. Now, as the largely unsuccessful boycott continues, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who founded PUSH, refers to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> black endorsers as &quot;shoe salesmen&quot; who seem more interested in making money than &quot;fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUSH officials complain that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- though its annual retail sales to black consumers total hundreds of millions of dollars -- has no high-ranking black executives and does no business with black-owned banks and advertising agencies. According to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 320 (7.5 percent) of its 4,243 U.S.-based employees are black. Blacks account for about 4 percent of the population of metropolitan Portland, Ore., where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has announced it will hire a minority vice president this year and name a minority to its board of directors by 1992. Knight said the appointments probably will be black. &quot;If we were perfect, we would've gotten that taken care of sooner,&quot; he said, adding that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was formed in 1972 as a small, &quot;too male and too white&quot; company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson, a $ 200,000-plus-a-year </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consultant, said no organization has a right to tell another how to do business. Jackson responded in a recent interview: &quot;That detachment from ethical responsibility, that detachment from racial justice, as opposed to personal aggrandizement, is not in the best tradition of fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boycott has had little apparent effect on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose earnings soared 58 percent last September, October and November over the corresponding period in 1989. Jackson said the PUSH boycott will continue until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> negotiates &quot;a joint plan for economic justice.&quot; The boycott may be difficult to sustain: PUSH, citing economic troubles, recently laid off its entire 12-person national staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson gently poked fun at Jackson last fall, giving him a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sneakers for his 49th birthday. &quot;When Jesse opened the box, he broke out laughing,&quot; Thompson recalled. But now Jackson isn't smiling. &quot;Those sneakers,&quot; he said, &quot;they're still in the box.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo Jackson's commercials created the impression that &quot;Bo knows&quot; the ins and outs of almost everything, especially sports. Now that the versatile athlete has been sidelined by a hip injury, one thing Bo does not know for sure is how much it will hurt his lucrative endorsement career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson had parlayed his prowess in professional baseball and football into a high-profile job as a spokesman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> athletic shoes, earning him at least $2 million a year. The popular &quot;Bo Knows&quot; commercials played off Jackson's talents as both a star running back for the Los Angeles Raiders and an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals. In the commercials, he seemed the perfect pitchman for the company's cross-training shoes, which are cloth and leather sneakers designed for more than one sport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackson's ads, in large part, helped </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. to overtake Reebok International as the leader in the athletic shoe industry.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Led to Other Endorsements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His fame in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials, created by Weiden &amp; Kennedy, a Portland, Ore., agency, also helped win him jobs as a spokesman for A.T.&amp; T. and Pepsico's Mountain Dew drink, which used a &quot;Bo Knows&quot; theme as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Monday, the Royals released Jackson because of a slow-healing injury to his left hip that he suffered while playing football in January. Doctors say they do not yet know whether complications from the injury will keep him from playing for any team the rest of the year, or permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports marketing consultants said his attractiveness to some advertisers could be severely damaged, if not destroyed, if he is never able to play again. &quot;It certainly does not make sense for sporting goods companies to use an injured sports celebrity,&quot; said David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, a consulting service for ad agencies seeking sports celebrity endorsements. &quot;The calls may simply stop coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is standing by Jackson. Liz Dolan, a company spokeswoman, said his injury, though serious, would probably not have a long-term effect on his relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should he recover. &quot;This is unfortunate,&quot; she said, &quot;but we'll wait for him to come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reluctance to abandon Jackson is not surprising, the company does not have to rely on him alone. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a stable of celebrities, including Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association and John McEnroe, the tennis star. In addition, Ms. Dolan said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is always looking for young athletes on the verge of stardom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock fell as much as $3.75 yesterday before closing at $45.75, down $1.75, but the decline may have had little to do with the company's advertising prospects. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said analysts had lowered their estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings. The shares had fallen $2.50 each on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Dolan said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just started work on its 1991 ad campaign, which will begin in July. She said that although no decision had been made, it was possible Jackson might be used in a humorous &quot;Bo Knows Rehab&quot; strategy for the cross-training shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if he had not been injured, Jackson would have been less prominent in the coming campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Ms. Dolan said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned to emphasize its basketball and outdoor cross-training shoes in the campaign and would use other sports celebrities. The company's previous campaign had concentrated on its sports cross-training shoes and had prominently featured Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Jackson does recover, but can play only one sport, probably baseball, consultants said he would still be able to do commercials. But his appeal would be limited, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo's advantage came from playing in two sports and appearing in sports stories most of the year,&quot; said Marty Blackman, a partner at Blackman &amp; Raber, a sports marketing and promotions consulting firm. &quot;With a lot of the glitter gone, his fees would certainly be reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultants said his endorsement fees, which by some estimates total about $5 million a year, could be cut by more than half if he is limited to just one sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some consultants said Jackson might have a hard time rounding up endorsements if he is never able to play any sport again. That would be because his career has been short; he has played professional football and baseball in the same year for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't play long enough to become an established sports personality,&quot; Mr. Blackman said. &quot;You have to become a champion like Joe Namath to have cachet once your sports career is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as a retired athlete, Jackson might be attractive to some advertisers who want to reach children. Lloyd Kolmer, the president of Lloyd Kolmer Enterprises, another consulting firm that helps match celebrities with advertisers, said Jackson was likely to continue to appeal to young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a hero's story,&quot; Mr. Kolmer said. &quot;Children look up to him, not just because of sports, but because of his anti-drug and stay-in-school commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The corporation also requested a stay of discovery related to discovery of enhanced damages and attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The corporation contended that separate trials would have promoted judicial economy; the issues of liability and damages were substantially distinct; and there was no right to a jury trial on the issues of enhancement and attorney fees. The court held that the jury's findings on infringement could have eliminated the damages issue or encourage settlement. The court also held that the issue of intent was irrelevant to determine infringement but crucial to the issue of enhanced damages. In addition, the court held that there was no right to a jury trial on the issue of enhanced damages and attorney fees and no Seventh Amendment violation would have occurred. Finally, the court held that it was reasonable to prevent discovery of all attorney-client privileged and work-product information until after the determination of liability. The corporation would have been forced to waive its attorney-client privilege on the intent issue because the court could have inferred that the corporation failed to obtain an attorney's opinion if the corporation did not produce an exculpatory opinion of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">The Issues of Liability Should Be Tried Separately From and Prior to the Issues of Damages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading patent infringement case notes that although a normal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law suit seldom requires bifurcation,  [HN3] &quot;the issues of validity, title, infringement, and damages in patent and copyright cases may be separately tried, unless this course will inconvenience the court or seriously prejudice the rights of some of the parties.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Swofford v. B &amp; W, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 34 F.R.D. 15 (S.D. Tex. 1963), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">aff'd,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;336 F.2d 406, 415 (5th Cir. 1964). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Separate Trials Will Promote Judicial Economy and Efficiency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently five patents are at issue in this case, and there are at least eight allegedly infringing products. Defendant's Memorandum, Page 5. Through highly technical proof, the jury will be required to interpret the patents and the allegedly infringing products. Evidence regarding damages may also be complex and involved with the potential &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**1477]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for calculations of reasonable royalties and lost profits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate trial on liability will likely result in a simplification of damage issues or the elimination of such an inquiry altogether. Should the jury find any of the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, no damages inquiry need be presented for those patents nor for any non-infringing product. Furthermore, a jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding on liability may encourage settlement of the damages issue and thereby eliminate the need for a second trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">The Issues of Liability and Damages are Substantially Distinct To Permit Separate Trials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN4] An important limitation under F. R. Civ. P. 42(b) is that the issues to be tried must be sufficiently distinct and separable such that separate trials will not result in overlap. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Swofford,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 336 F.2d at 415. Here the liability issues will require proof of the specifics of the invention, the validity of the patent, and the structure and operation of the allegedly infringing product. The damages issue is substantially different and will require proof of sales, costing factors, profit levels and offsetting costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff contends that the issue of willfulness will overlap under both liability and damages and therefore result in violation of the Seventh Amendment. The Ninth Circuit has unequivocally asserted,  [HN5] &quot;In determining the question of infringement, the desire or intent to infringe a patent is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">irrelevant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However intent is crucial to the imposition of increased damages.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Wilden Pump &amp; Engineering Co. v. Pressed &amp; Welded Products Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 655 F.2d 984, 989 (9th Cir. 1981)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Because intent is irrelevant to a determination of patent infringement, there is no overlap concerning willfulness between the issue of liability and damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although an overlap regarding evidence of the &quot;commercial success&quot; of the products is likely to occur, this court is not convinced that such an overlap is great enough to justify denial of bifurcation. One court granting separate trials for liability and damages in a patent infringement dispute explains, &quot;The question of commercial success is not ordinarily determined by a detailed analysis of exhaustive and intricate financial data, such as is required for proof of damages, but rather by whether the claimed invention is, broadly speaking, an accepted product and a big seller.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis v. Merrill Lynch,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 587 F.Supp. 1112, 1116 (D. Del. 1984). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff also contends that defendant's request for bifurcation is premature because discovery has just commenced. It is not uncommon, however, for courts to bifurcate issues of liability and damages before substantial discovery has occurred and there is time to stay discovery of damages. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Giro Sport Design, Inc. v. Pro-Tec, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10 U.S.P.Q.2d 1863 (N.D. Cal. 1989); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Eaton Corp. v. Auburn Gear, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8 U.S.P.Q.2d 1373 (N.D. Ind. 1988). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Plaintiff Will Not Be Prejudiced by Separate Trials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN6] Separate trials only violate the Seventh Amendment when they involve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">both</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overlapping issues </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> different juries. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Paine, Webber,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 587 F. Supp. at 1116 (emphasis in original). Because this court has found no substantial overlap between the issues of liability and damages, there is no Seventh Amendment violation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">There Is No Right to a Jury Trial On The Issue of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Enhancement of Damages and Awarding Attorneys' Fees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [HN7] 35 U.S.C. &sect; 284 provides that the court may increase damages up to three times the amount found or assessed in patent infringement cases. 35 U.S.C. &sect; 285 allows the court to award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in an exceptional case. After both a detailed analysis of the language of 35 U.S.C. &sect; 284 and prior patent case law, the leading case on this issue held that  [HN8] there is no constitutional right to a jury trial on issues under either &sect; 284 or &sect; 285. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Swofford,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 336 F.2d at 411-414.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">See, also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">White v. Mar-Bel, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 509 F.2d 287, 292 (5th Cir. 1975) (jury's finding that compensatory damages should be trebled is advisory only). Therefore the issues of enhancement of damages and awarding of attorneys' fees must be presented to the court in a separate trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Discovery of Attorney-Client Privileged Information and Attorney Work-Product Related to Enhanced Damages and Attorneys' Fees Shall Be Stayed Until After a Determination of Liability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Circuit has asserted that  [HN9] when a party charged with patent infringement fails to produce exculpatory opinion of counsel, the court may infer that the party failed to obtain such an opinion or that the opinion advised against the party's continued use of its product. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Fromson v. Western Litho Plate &amp; Supply Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 853 F.2d 1568, 1672-73 (Fed. Cir. 1988). A party may be forced to waive the attorney-client privilege and the work product immunity in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**1478]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order to defend against a charge of willful infringement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because willfulness is not relevant to the issue of liability, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> request to stay all attorney-client privileged information and attorney work-product related to willfulness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  until after a determination of liability is reasonable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be unfairly prejudiced if it is required to divulge the contents of its private communication with counsel prior to a determination on liability because such communications typically discuss legal theories and strategy. The rationale for staying privileged information or attorney work product does not extend to a stay of all discovery relating to enhanced damages or awarding attorneys' fees. Therefore, discovery of attorney-client privileged information and attorney work product relating to enhanced damages and attorneys' fees is stayed until after a determination of liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c14">CONCLUSION</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion for separate trials of the issues of liability, damages, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees and for a stay of discovery related to willfulness (docket #13) is GRANTED. Separate jury trials for the issues of liability and damages will be held. After these trials a separate court trial on the issue of enhanced damages and attorneys' fees will be held. Discovery related to willfulness is stayed until after a determination of liability, but this stay is limited to attorney-client privileged information and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attorney work product. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff corporation brought an action against defendant corporation, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Plaintiff also brought a motion for a preliminary injunction. Both parties were in the business of manufacturing and selling sportswear and athletic equipment. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion finding a likelihood of success on the merits and a great possibility of irreparable injury. The court found plaintiff's mark was a strong mark where it was arbitrary and fanciful. Where the parties' goods were related, their marks similar, and plaintiff demonstrated actual consumer confusion, the court found consumer confusion to exist. The court also found the parties used similar marketing channels and a typical consumer was likely to be confused by the two marks as to the source or sponsorship of the products. The court found defendant's defenses of laches and abandonment did not prevent the court's grant of an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">GRANTS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Court finds that plaintiff has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits and a great possibility of irreparable harm.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">I. Standards for Preliminary Injunction</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN1] The criteria for issuing a preliminary injunction are (1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits, (2) the possibility of irreparable injury to the plaintiff if the relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) advancement of public interest. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN2] In the Ninth Circuit, the moving party may meet the burden of proof by showing a combination of either (1) likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in the movant's favor.  Id. at 1201. These are not two separate tests, but &quot;they are merely extremes of a single continuum.&quot; Benda v.

Likelihood of Confusion as to Source or Sponsorship</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN3] The tests for infringement of a trademark and for unfair competition are the same: whether there is a likelihood of confusion as to source or sponsorship of the two products at issue. New West Corp. v. NYM Co., 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir. 1979).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In determining whether confusion is likely, the following factors are relevant:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) strength of the mark;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) proximity of the goods;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) similarity of the marks;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) marketing channels used;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) likelihood of expansion of the product lines.AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-9 (9th Cir. 1979).<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">B. Application of the Sleekcraft Factors</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Strength &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   of the mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds that the trademark &quot;Sideout&quot; is an arbitrary and fanciful mark. The term &quot;Sideout&quot; does not in any way describe the goods for which it is being used as a trademark. Therefore, it is not a descriptive trademark.  [HN4] Arbitrary and fanciful trademarks are considered to be inherently distinctive and &quot;strong&quot; marks. 1 McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition &sect; 11:2 (2d ed. 1984).<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">2. Proximity of the goods</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is undisputed that both parties sell sportswear under their respective marks. The Court finds that although there are differences in the types of goods sold under the Sideout and Side 1 marks, the goods sold under both are at least related goods, i.e., all can be considered sports or athletic equipment. Therefore, there is a greater chance that the public will mistakenly assume that there is an association among the producers of such goods. Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 350 (citing Stork Restaurant, Inc. v. Sahati, 166 F.2d 348, 356 (9th Cir. 1948)).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, there is evidence that many stores carry both product lines, and that, in at least one case, the products have been delayed near each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Similarity &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   of the marks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds the visual appearance of the two marks is likely to cause confusion as to source or sponsorship of their product lines. In particular, the Court notes that the marks use extremely similar elongated lettering. As well, both marks use somewhat similar looking geometric symbols/designs, often paring the symbol/design mark with the word mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court also finds that the dominant word in both marks, the word &quot;side,&quot; is split from the word &quot;out&quot; on some of Sideout's clothing. This type of display adds to the potential likelihood of consumer confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the similarity of the two marks, the Court finds that there is a likelihood that consumers will think that Side 1 is actually Sideout or a different product line made by Sideout.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">4. Evidence of actual confusion</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of actual confusion, Sideout has submitted a number of declarations by various people who claim to have been confused as to the source or origin of Side 1 products after having seen a Side 1 commercial aired on television or a Side 1 magazine advertisement. The Court does not find </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attack on these declarations to be convincing. The Court finds that most of these declarations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  support a finding of actual confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court does not find </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> survey, with its +8% margin of error, to be sufficient evidence of lack of confusion, especially when viewed with the declarations submitted by Sideout.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">5. Marketing channels used</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds that both companies advertise their products in magazines, although the actual magazines in which the product lines appear are different. The Court also finds that both parties advertise through television commercials, although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to have a more extensive television advertising campaign. This difference is likely to be attributable to the difference in size between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Sideout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the Court finds that although there is some difference in the marketing channels of the two products, there appears to be some overlap.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">6. Type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN5] In determining likelihood of confusion, the standard of care expected to be exercised by a consumer is that of the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution. Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353. The Court finds that Sideout markets a substantial number of products which are priced similarly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Side 1's products. The Court finds that a consumer exercising the degree of care commensurate with the expense of the products involved is likely to be confused as to the source or sponsorship of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Side 1 products.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">7. Defendant's intent in selecting the mark</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds that the evidence on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intent in selecting the Side 1 mark is inconclusive, although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to know that they were creating a very similar mark.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">8. Likelihood of expansion of the product lines</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is evidence that Sideout is in the process of expanding its product line into many areas beyond t-shirts, shorts, warm-ups and sweatshirts. Although Sideout still maintains its close association with volleyball sports wear, Sideout appears to be branching out into other areas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well, appears to be expanding its Side 1 trademark beyond women's athletic shoes.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">9. Conclusion</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a careful examination and weighing of the various Sleekcraft factors, the Court finds that plaintiff has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits with respect to a likelihood of confusion between plaintiff's Sideout logo and defendant's Side 1 current lettering style and TRISM design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hike's Affirmative Defenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court has considered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> affirmative defenses of laches and constructive abandonment. The Court finds that neither of these defenses, based on the facts presented at this juncture, warrants denial of the preliminary injunction.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">III. Irreparable Harm</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN6] In trademark infringement cases, irreparable injury may be presumed where there is a strong likelihood of success on the merits. Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Intern., Inc., 725 F.2d 521, 525 (9th Cir. 1984). Once a company has built up goodwill in its trademark, infringing activity that causes a likelihood of confusion as to source or sponsorship is presumed to cause irreparable injury to a company's reputation.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">IV. Scope of the Injunctive Relief</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court enjoins defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from using, in advertising, promotion or sale, the SIDE 1 current lettering style and TRISM design. The Court, in issuing this limited injunction, makes no ruling as to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Greek&quot; style logo or any other Side 1 logo. The Court notes, however, that any use of the &quot;Greek&quot; style logo or any other Side 1 logo would be at defendant's own risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is requested to prepare a formal injunction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in accordance with this ruling no later than December 2, 1991.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">V. Bond</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court requests further briefing from both parties as to the issue of bond taking into account feasibility as well as appropriate security. Such briefing shall be submitted no later than December 2, 1991 at 9:00 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS SO ORDERED.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quit gasping about player contracts such as Bobby Bonilla's $ 29 million deal with the New York Mets. A new book, Swoosh: The Story of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Men Who Played There, explains that sports business successes sometimes come with a lot more zeros on the bottom line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> founder Philip Knight, a former University of Oregon runner who began with little more than an idea from one of his papers in business school, was instantly worth $ 178 million when the Beaverton, Ore., company went public in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Super Bowl XXVI, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it will debut a TV ad that pairs Michael Jordan with ''one of the most powerful icons of the 20th century.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the company's less-cosmic early days, as shown by co-authors J.B. Strasser and her sister, Laurie Becklund, sound a lot more fun:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The company's name came to one of the founding workers in a dream. (Knight wanted ''Dimension Six.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got its air-cushioned shoes only because it listened to an unemployed aerospace researcher ignored by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- An art student designed the Swoosh logo for $ 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in detailing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ups and downs, the authors are instructive. Women, not to mention minorities, were never in the management loop - even as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was dismissing the fledgling aerobics craze as ''fat ladies dancing to music.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only survived, arguably, because of early backing from a Japanese creditor - U.S. banks were too timid - and because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overcame regulatory interference from the U.S. government. Litigation became </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standard operating procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors conclude that ''the individualism that made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> different is gone, but so is the spirit that made employees care.'' Then again, today's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> workers can't just do it - it already has been done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER A PERIOD of double-digit growth in the mid-1980s, the athletic footwear market has plateaued.  In 1990 the U.S. market hit $11.9 billion on 393 million pairs of athletic footwear. That represents only a 1 percent increase in units and a 10 percent sales gain, the smallest jump since 1984.  ''The overall athletic footwear market has reached a difficult point for manufacturers, as the recession and price competition from casual shoes are having some impact,'' says Sebastian DiCasoli, SGMA's director of marketing sales.  Still, despite concern over cost, four out of every 10 shoes sold in the United States are athletic-style. In addition, DiCasoli says, the possibility of strong sales for athletic footwear looks bright because of greater participation in fitness walking and the continued promotion of outdoor and cross-training shoes.  In an effort to spur the static market, companies are continuously bringing out new shoes.  ''Without a doubt, the newest meaningful development is the system of air bladders, started by Reebok,'' says Bob Gillespie, a store manager for the Allied Sporting Goods chain. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now has an air-pressure system and L.A.  Gear uses it in their R egulator Series.'' The air-pressure system provides the wearer with a custom fit. The shoe conforms to the foot, no matter what the configuration.  On the premise that if air can make a shoe conform to the foot it also can make a glove conform to the hand, Spalding and Mizuno have come out with baseball gloves featuring the air system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillespie says his most popular shoe is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $130 Charles Barkley model.  ''All the kids want it,'' he says, referring to the black low-cut shoe which makes the air bladder visible through the shoe's mid-sole.  ''There are probably better basketball shoes on the market but this happens to be the one that's hot right now,'' says Gillespie, whose store's price points are from $29.99 for a standard leather tennis shoe to $150 for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Force 180 high top with air-system arch and ankle supports.  Popular as the air-system shoes are, one pro shop manager and buyer is not a fan.  ''I've had a lot of bad luck with pump shoes,'' says Barbara Ensner of Evansville, Ind. ''Reebok is making a pump walking shoe in which the pump malfunctions.'' Her shop does well the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Challenge model, worn by top-ranked tennis pro Andre Agassi, Wilson's Pro Staff tennis shoe, and Head's Sonic, a tri-court shoe for racquetball, tennis or basketball.  Another new shoe is the $125 Brooks ''Fusion'' model, with a shock-reducing fusion plate that bends with the wearer and snaps back into place, producing a rebound effect. It's rated tops by Runner's World magazine.  ''The air bag has been around since the late '70s, but the fusion plate is newer,'' says Jim Nolan, a shoe store manager.  Nolan's best selling shoe is still </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan, named for Chicago Bulls forward, Michael Jordan. ''It's a basketball shoe,'' Nolan says, ''but 90 percent of my sales are not to basketball players.'' The Air Jordan has been the best selling basketball shoe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since 1985, when the company signed the pro, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman Melinda Gable.  She says a new Air Jordan will be introduced in February that will be lighter in weight ''with a more dynamic, glove-like fit.'' In the new shoe, heavier leather has been cut away. So has some material from the outsole.  After Jan. 1, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will introduce its Air Flight Mid, worn by Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls. Weighing only 14.3 ounces, the shoe has a specially constructed tongue.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new running shoe is the Air Huarache that, according to Gable, ''is so lightweight it's minimalistic.'' Made without a heel counter, the shoe features a back strapping system and sells for $110.  Cross-trainers, athletic shoes that are not sports-specific, have been popular for some time. The Sports Quarters' Nolan says he ''lives in'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross-trainers, with leather upper and air bags in the heel only.  But Gable issues a warning to those who use them for sports: ''Serious athletes should get a sports shoe.''</SPAN></P>

(AP) - Bo Jackson's hip injury put his professional baseball and football careers on hold, but hasn't cost him a step in his other high-paying job - commercial pitchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad makers for Pepsi-Cola Co. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. have even turned Bo's injury to their advantage, pressing him into service in new advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else have I got to do this summer?,&quot; Jackson says as he sits in a beach chair in a cameo appearance in Pepsi's summer ad campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He does everything but relax in the latest and probably the last edition of his &quot;Bo Knows . . .&quot; commercials for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a commercial filmed at the Culver City Studios, Jackson abruptly walks out on his own Las Vegas-style show to start some serious rehabilitation in the gym. That leaves the door open for that burger-eating boxer George Foreman and others who jump at the chance to fill Bo's shoes in the lounge act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads begin running July 9 during the All-Star baseball game telecast, the same occasion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used two years ago to launch the series with a commercial that also featured another famous Bo, bluesman Bo Diddley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That commercial and a 1990 ad that showed Jackson ready to compete in a dozen different sports made him one of the best-known athlete endorsers in the business and added a phrase to the American vernacular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rare athlete who successfully competes in two professional sports, Jackson was a natural fit for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross-training shoe, designed for multiple uses - running, shooting baskets, lifting weights, riding a bike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helped by Jackson's commercials, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says sales of the shoes have climbed from nothing in 1987 to about $400 million (U.S.) this year, making them second only to basketball shoes among top-ranked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> best-selling models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer surveys by the research firm Video Storyboard Tests Inc. indicated Jackson was the best-known endorser from sports in 1989 and ranked him second only to football's Joe Montana in 1990. The 1991 results aren't in yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Marketing Letter rated Jackson as the 10th most sought-after sports figure by marketers this year despite the hip injury. The newsletter's publisher, Brian Murphy, estimated Jackson will make $5 million this year from advertising, several million more than he will likely make from sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injury Jackson suffered while playing football for the Los Angeles Raiders has prevented him from playing baseball this year. The Kansas City Royals dropped him after doctors said he might never play again, but he was signed by the Chicago White Sox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His doctors say Jackson is making progress and will be re-evaluated over the All-Star break to see if he can play baseball this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his injury raised questions about Jackson's commercial career. Some marketing experts said Jackson would likely fade from view as many retired athletes have if he were unable to play again. Others said his struggle back would keep people interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, said Jackson remains in demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the extra work for Pepsi and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woods said, Jackson is promoting lines of sports medicine and fitness products and is considering two major endorsement offers that wouldn't have been made without the injury. Woods declined to identify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Jackson was injured, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad makers had been seeking a way to give the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; series of ads a big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sendoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole 'Bo Knows' thing had been overexposed,&quot; said Jim Riswold, the Wieden &amp; Kennedy ad writer who created the series three years ago. &quot;The time to end 'Bo knows' has come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Bedbury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising director, agreed that he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; to see any more variations on the theme next year although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will probably use Jackson in other commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riswold came up with a stylish sendoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson is the star of the &quot;Bo Show,&quot; a garish act with 20 chorus girls in White Sox or Raiders jerseys, a 30- piece orchestra and Bo's name in lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo knows it's got that air thing,&quot; the chorus girls sing as they dance around Jackson, who is wearing a tuxedo and has a microphone in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a few choruses, Jackson has second thoughts. He yells for the band to stop. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he says, walking off the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camera then moves to a living room where the TV set is tuned to the Bo show. Mom is shocked and Dad looks perplexed as Bo crawls through the set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got rehab to do,&quot; Jackson mutters as he reaches back into the set for his cross-trainers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice shoes,&quot; a boy sitting on the floor says as Jackson passes through the living room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You watch too much TV, kid,&quot; Jackson shoots back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the gym, Jackson lifts weights, pedals a stationary bike and works out in the pool. He can't shake that irritating &quot;air thing&quot; song, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I don't have time for this,&quot; he yells at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Jackson walks away, the logo rolls up, revealing the same glitzy set where the backlights have been changed to read, &quot;Not Bo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I do,&quot; says Foreman, dressed in a tux and surrounded by the chorus girls now dressed in boxer shorts and orange boxing gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hit it,&quot; Foreman orders, as the band plays again and the girls sing &quot;George knows . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has three other endings for use later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one version, Los Angeles Kings star Wayne Gretzky takes over from Bo, a throwback to the original &quot;Bo knows . . .&quot; ad where Gretzky was the only athlete unable to attest that Jackson could play his sport - ice hockey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other versions end with pairs of athletes - Darryl Strawberry of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and Jerry Rice of football's San Francisco 49ers in one; Eric Davis of baseball's Cincinnati Reds and Randall Cunningham of football's Philadelphia Eagles in the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Bo knows . . . &quot; campaign may provide the grist for trivia games a few years from now. Jackson may turn up in nostalgic beer or credit card ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or the ads may have sent Jackson on the road to a long career as a celebrity spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He represents not only a versatile athlete but the whole fad of being fit,&quot; said David Vadehra, head of Video Storyboard Tests, the firm that quizzes thousands of people each year on what commercials they liked best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Marketing Letter's Murphy envisions Jackson effectively pitching recreational sports such as golf, weight training or tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea has already been established in the public's mind that this is a guy who does everything,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most influential characters in basketball is a pudgy&nbsp;former high school coach who counts John Thompson and Jerry Tarkanian&nbsp;among his close friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Paul &quot;Sonny&quot; Vaccaro has been ranked one of the 100 most&nbsp;powerful people in sports by The Sporting News. He's No. 80, right behind&nbsp;Michael Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without question, Vaccaro, 52, is the greatest sneaker salesman in&nbsp;America. He is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conduit to the big-name college coaches and marquee&nbsp;programs such as Georgetown and Syracuse, signing coaches to six-figure&nbsp;contracts, some in the neighborhood of $ 200,000, for the favor of&nbsp;outfitting their teams in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hosts summer camps showcasing the country's finest high school&nbsp;players, with all invitees approved by Vaccaro. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sponsors the Dapper&nbsp;Dan Roundball Classic, the granddaddy of national high school all-star&nbsp;games, which Vaccaro started in Pittsburgh in 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics have trashed Vaccaro for allegedly directing top&nbsp;recruits to college coaches under contract to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. NCAA investigators,&nbsp;in general, are leery of his cozy relationship with both players and&nbsp;coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the wake of the NBA draft, Vaccaro is under attack from&nbsp;agents who claim he is cutting into their business. Vaccaro, although not&nbsp;involved in contract negotiations, has a hand in the marketing of several&nbsp;first-round picks - including Billy Owens, Dikembe Mutombo and Stacey&nbsp;Augmon, and he is negotiating with Larry Johnson, the No. 1 pick in the&nbsp;draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the draft picks played at college programs under contract to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything is an angle,&quot; said agent Ron Grinker, who represents&nbsp;Danny Manning, the first pick in the 1988 draft. &quot;I deal with him for&nbsp;players on shoe contracts . But now, I have to worry about him talking&nbsp;to players. He can go on any college campus where he has college coaches&nbsp;under contract and talk to every player. It's a scenario that is not very&nbsp;tasteful to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Grantham, executive director of the NBA Players Association,&nbsp;said he has been assured by Vaccaro that he will not be involved in&nbsp;negotiating player contracts. The NBA players union has no jurisdiction&nbsp;over endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials deny any potential conflict, saying his&nbsp;latest business venture is independent of the athletic wear company.&nbsp;Vaccaro describes himself as a consultant for DIC Marketing, a Burbank,&nbsp;Calif., firm that has secured agreements to represent the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am the conduit, the go-between,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;They approached&nbsp;me a year ago and said they wanted to get involved with athletes. They&nbsp;knew I've been around athletes all my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccaro said he screened agents for some of the players, further&nbsp;raising the ire of those who couldn't get interviews. He also negotiated&nbsp;deals for trading cards on behalf of several players - among them Augmon,&nbsp;Owens, Mutombo, Greg Anthony, Anderson Hunt and George Ackles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several agents accused Vaccaro of directing Augmon, the Atlanta&nbsp;Hawks' top draft choice, and Owens to player representative Arn Tellem.&nbsp;Vaccaro and Tellem, however, deny they have a business relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of the agents I've heard from believe Sonny locked them&nbsp;out of a chance to get these guys,&quot; said Fred Schreyer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> director&nbsp;of sports marketing. &quot;I don't believe that's the case. The few players he&nbsp;is advising are kids he has been close to for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magic Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, said the only way to get to Augmon&nbsp;was through Vaccaro. He never met the player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been with Sonny for five years and I trust him,&quot; said Augmon.&nbsp;&quot;He's the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guy and he's been around our program. I met him in high&nbsp;school at the Dapper Dan, and I've been keeping close to him because he&nbsp;lives in the L.A. area. We go out to dinner. I know his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By conservative estimates, Vaccaro has signed more than 60 major&nbsp;college coaches - among them Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech and Hugh&nbsp;Durham of Georgia - to contracts with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, along with more than 25 of&nbsp;the country's most influential high school coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money Vaccaro can put in coaches' pockets has elevated him to&nbsp;the position of power broker. In some instances, college coaches find&nbsp;themselves earning more in &quot;shoe money&quot; than is paid them by their&nbsp;respective universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sonny, by his reputation, is a controversial guy,&quot; said David Falk&nbsp;of ProServ. &quot;He's got lots of contacts and can bring something to the&nbsp;party. I don't think that's all bad, but I think it threatens a lot of&nbsp;people. They feel he may have an advantage through his contacts and may&nbsp;be able to do things for players they're not able to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, Falk is reluctant to criticize Vaccaro's dealings.&nbsp;Thompson, the Georgetown coach, is friends of both, and several of his&nbsp;former players are represented by Falk. But even Vaccaro acknowledges&nbsp;that Falk is upset that while his agency is negotiating the contract for&nbsp;Mutombo, Georgetown's latest star, Vaccaro will be responsible for the&nbsp;marketing and endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time ProServ has lost a player to a marketing&nbsp;situation,&quot; said Vaccaro, who previously tried his hand as a gambler and&nbsp;rock 'n' roll concert promoter. &quot;They sort of pride themselves on what&nbsp;they've done with Michael Jordan , so they're upset about Mutombo. It's&nbsp;the first time an outsider, so to speak, has entered their domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't do anything illegal with any of these kids. I know probably&nbsp;all the kids. If they're worried about that, they ought to pray I don't&nbsp;become an agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently sacrificing personal financial reward, Georgia Tech&nbsp;football coach Bobby Ross outfitted his 1990 national championship squad&nbsp;with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes his players preferred, taking a $ 37,000 cut from his&nbsp;previous contract with Pony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strained relationship between Ross and Pony was evident in a&nbsp;letter to him from the company's national marketing manager for football,&nbsp;Randy Beverly, dated Nov. 6, 1989. It noted that a number of Tech players&nbsp;were wearing shoes made by other companies, saying that &quot;could be&nbsp;perceived as a material breach of contract.&quot; It also stated: &quot;I would&nbsp;like to assume that this is a temporary slip on your part and that you&nbsp;will ensure that in future games the players will wear the appropriate&nbsp;footwear.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 26, 1990, Ross signed a contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even know what it says,&quot; Ross said of his contract with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which paid him only $ 6,000 last season. &quot;I used to get some money&nbsp;from Pony, but the kids wanted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes, so we changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross's remuneration from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is paid strictly on an incentive&nbsp;basis:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 1,000 for winning a conference championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 5,000 for winning a national championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross also receives $ 2,000 (retail value) in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides 50 pairs of shoes for Tech players, and others must be&nbsp;purchased at a rate of three pairs for the price of two. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides&nbsp;100 free pairs if Tech goes to a bowl game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Ross's contract with Pony, Tech received 400 pairs of shoes in&nbsp;1987 and 300 pairs in both 1988 and 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, each of 12 assistants and six other persons designated by Ross&nbsp;receives $ 500 in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> merchandise, and Ross receives 400 T-shirts to&nbsp;distribute to youngsters at his summer camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross was paid a $ 25,000 base stipend by Pony for the 1989 season,&nbsp;which included the following incentives:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 1,000 for each national network television game, $ 500 for each&nbsp;regional game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 2,000 for a Jan. 1 bowl appearance, or $ 1,000 for a non-New&nbsp;Year's Day bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 500 for a Top 20 finish, $ 1,000 for a Top 10 finish, $ 5,000 for a&nbsp;national championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 1,000 for an ACC title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- $ 5,000 for being named national coach of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross would have gotten $ 4,000 from Pony for Tech's televised games&nbsp;this season. There is no TV incentive in his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan tries to blow the Los Angeles Lakers off the basketball court in the NBA finals, an Arlington inventor is putting on a full-court press against one of Jordan's biggest backers, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Petrosky, a 73-year-old inventor who works out of a cluttered shop in his basement, claims in a federal suit in Alexandria that the manufacturing giant swiped his invention when it marketed the Air Jordan sneaker, named after the Bulls' star guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knew about Mr. Petrosky and his idea for an air cushion sole before the introduction of the Air Max and the Air Jordan,&quot; said Joel M. Freed, Petrosky's attorney. Freed said his client patented an air cushion sole in 1978 and tried to sell the idea to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> long before it first marketed the Air Jordan in the 1980s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit has been compared by attorneys on both sides to the case of a former Maryland man who accused several carmakers of stealing his idea for an intermittent windshield wiper now used on millions of vehicles. The Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay inventor Robert W. Kearns $ 10.2 million in that suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrosky's suit, which is not expected to come to trial until the fall, seeks what could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties and penalties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it has sold millions of pairs of Air Jordans at a retail price of more than $ 100 a pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representatives said its Air Jordan and Air Max shoes bear little resemblance to the air cushion sole patented by Petrosky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at his proposed system and you look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, no one would say they are the same,&quot; said Leslie A. Nicholson, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attorneys.  &quot;More importantly, they work very differently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicholson also said that Petrosky's invention &quot;is remarkably similar&quot; to an air cushion sole patented in the early 1900s and that the suit may raise the question of whether Petrosky's shoe should have been awarded a patent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrosky's sole has several chambers that are connected by tiny holes. The chambers are filled using the kind of air pump and needle used to inflate basketballs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> air cushions are sealed plastic bladders that are inserted into the sole of the shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theory behind each is that when the wearer walks heel to toe, the cushions redistribute the air so that the contours always provide support and a comfortable fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representative Lindsay D. Stewart conceded that &quot;the little guy-big guy phenomenon&quot; is a factor in the Petrosky case and that a jury might hold more sympathy for the &quot;basement shop-style&quot; inventor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrosky, who was hospitalized recently for infections in his cardiovascular system, said he was eager to return to his beloved basement workshop on North Jefferson Street. Though he was given last rites recently, he has improved, and doctors have given him a favorable prognosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I get to feeling better, I'm going to get back at it,&quot; Petrosky said from his bed in Arlington Hospital. He said he continues to have new ideas and yearns for the days when he would &quot;get up at 2 o'clock in the morning and go down to the basement and tinker around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrosky's tinkering dates to the late 1940s, when he was discharged from the Army after World War II and he and a friend opened a barbershop in the Ballston area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dreamed up a razor strop that was mounted on a support beam so the barber could sharpen his straight razor without having to use two hands. Charles T. Petrosky, the inventor's 38-year-old son, said his father failed to patent the gadget and was angry when he later saw a mounted strop advertised in a trade journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the fish that got away,&quot; the inventor's son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From then on -- especially when the elder Petrosky retired from cutting hair in 1975 -- the inventor was far more mindful of patenting his ideas. He was awarded nine patents over the years, including one for a ring with a small blade attached that could be used in self-defense and another for a system designed to rid cities of rats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrosky's son said his father invented the ring because he was concerned about increasing urban violence and assaults against women. &quot;If a woman slapped someone across the face with the ring on, it would scratch them -- mark them -- so that police could identify them easier,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;classic better rat trap&quot; sat on the bed of a truck and used bait to lure rats out of alleys, up a ramp and into a chamber where they could not escape. &quot;All the man would have to do is drop by in the morning and pick up the truck,&quot; Petrosky's son said. While the truck was being driven away, the rats would be killed by fumes pumped into the chamber from the truck's exhaust, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither invention captured consumers' imaginations, and though a few rings were manufactured, none was ever sold, Petrosky's son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just never got off the ground in marketing,&quot; the elder Petrosky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freed refused to let the Petroskys discuss the inspiration for the air cushion sole because of the lawsuit. But a 1978 newspaper article said Petrosky had pinned his hopes for fame and fortune on what he described as a &quot;walking-on-air&quot; shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You take a common football needle and hand air pump, and just pump away,&quot; he told the now-defunct Washington Star. &quot;A gunky substance inside seals it when you remove the needle. It's a million-dollar idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

There he is innocently watching his basketball or baseball game expecting it to be interrupted by commercials, sure, but jock-style commercials aimed at jock-style guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly he's bombarded by incredible images that flash by his eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images of a sci-fi creature emerging from a pod as humanoid, a cartoon daredevil bouncing inside a giant running shoe, or an animated runner, escaping from his own burning scrapbook image.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen-second and 30-second mini art films created and directed by some of the world's most talented filmmakers (including Canada's David Cronenburg) and commissioned by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to advertise its new 180 air-cushioned running shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are these commercials art? Or commercial art? Or just commercial? And what are they doing on jock TV?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign was born last year when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked its ad agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, to come up with a campaign for the 180 that could run internationally. (The 180 was the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> athletic shoe to be introduced everywhere in the world at once.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem was how to communicate to people who speak different languages and idolize different sports heroes, sports heroes being </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> traditional creative approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creative folk at the agency solved the problem by suggesting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commission filmmakers from different parts of the world to express what the 180 meant to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new 50 per cent larger air cushion was to be the main focus, with no spoken words, just music and sound effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting commercials were surprising, even to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Originally scheduled to launch in North America on the Superbowl, the spots were held back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another commercial was hurriedly put together, using </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> traditional sports hero approach, and featuring triathalon champ Mark Allen. The jocks were safe from art for a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the artsy ads got good reaction in Europe, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Phil Knight, decided to try them out at home. And according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they've worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it be that people who are ready to shell out $150 for a running shoe ($169.99 in Canada, $192 with tax) are also ready for art in their running shoe commercials?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The artistic approach has some opponents, however. It prompted one columnist to criticize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> print version of this campaign as a self-motivated form of corporate sponsorship of the arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in fact, the campaign is nothing of the sort. It was motivated by the need to find a practical solution to a problem, that of creating international advertising. And in the process, filmmakers were given the kind of artistic freedom seldom granted to commercial illustrators or directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were also given exposure to a world-wide audience that would likely never have heard of them otherwise. Not a bad trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you haven't seen the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 180 commercials, you still have a chance until June. David Cronenburg's sci-fi thriller, and Dutch animator Evert de Beijer's giant running shoe are still airing on CTV during Blue Jays games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mooooove Over, Cancows: That singing cow is back in the news again. It seems the bronze Bessie award-winning crooner for HP Sauce is one more example of an American performer appearing in a Canadian commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, that lounge-cow is from Arizona, born and bred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to writer Bill Martin, creator of the HP commercial, ad agency Bozell Palmer Bonner would have cast a Canadian cow, but the weather in November was too cold for the shoot. They cast this particular cow because she looked like a Canadian cow, and had no ear-notches or curly horns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of 26,000 cows in the herd, how did she get the part?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Martin: &quot;She probably didn't move away as fast as the other cows when they came to take Polaroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She didn't have to know how to sing either. In close-up, the singing cow was actually a puppet, and the voice was Canadian musician Tim Tickner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, fans of this commercial can look forward to a follow-up in September, starring a chicken and a pig named Wilbur, pitching four new sauces from HP. They're Americans too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The duo won't be singing, but you can bet the commercial will be fun and sophisticated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, rumor has it the cow has signed up an agent and will be appearing in Vegas next month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. filed a lawsuit today against L.A. Gear Inc., charging its rival with incorporating a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-patented design in its new Catapult basketball shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit, filed in Federal District Court here, says some elements of L.A.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spring moderator, L.A. Gear's Catapult shoe has a cushioning system designed to improve the jumping performance of wearers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a limited partnership formed by Bob Van Kampen in May, did not disclose terms of the transaction.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a press release from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Clayton Brown sponsored 82 different trusts in 1991, representing an investment of more than $625 million.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said his firm bought &quot;18 years of successful business&quot; when it completed the transaction for Clayton Brown's UIT division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intend to build rapidly upon the excellent reputation which the First Trust name has established over the past 18 years,&quot; he stated. &quot;This is the first step in building a total financial services product line, and we hope to grow the distribution system as well as the range of products offered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen added that most of the 40 to 45 employees in Clayton Brown's UIT division have chosen to join </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. James Bowen, the former head of Clayton Brown's UIT division who joined </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earlier this year, will head up the new operation at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to the press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Clayton Brown &amp; Associates, Mr. Pelzer said the firm would &quot;continue to expand the capital markets part of our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that business includes tax-exempt and taxable institutional sales as well as public finance activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen confirmed last month that his new firm was in negotiations to buy the division from his former business associate Clayton Brown, the chairman of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates. Clayton Brown was once part of a firm - Van Kampen Wauterlek Brown &amp; Co. - that Mr. Van Kampen started in 1967. Seven years later, the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, Mr. Van Kampen sold his firm to Xerox Financial Services, which announced earlier this year that it was discontinuing its investment banking business to concentrate on the development and distribution of its asset management products, including UITs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than a month after that announcement, Mr. Van Kampen started </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with several former Van Kampen Merritt employees. Ironically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has leased some of Van Kampen Merritt's old office space in Lisle, Ill. Van Kampen Merritt moved its offices to Oak Brook, Ill., earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said he hoped to consolidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the newly acquired UIT business in Lisle within 30 days. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been running its sales, trading, and underwriting business out of temporary quarters in West Chicago, Ill., and the UIT business out of Clayton Brown's Chicago headquarters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest sneaker attacks by Reebok, British Knights and L.A. Gear&nbsp;against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have rankled executives at the top athletic shoe company,&nbsp;but don't expect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to kick back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going into the mud-wrestling pit with them,&quot; says Andy&nbsp;Mooney, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vice president of marketing, who called the attacks &quot;par&nbsp;for the course when you're No. 1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok and L.A. Gear launched their air assaults during the Super&nbsp;Bowl broadcast. Reebok's ads featured jock endorsers telling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;endorsers to &quot;Pump Up, and Air Out.&quot; In L.A. Gear's ads for its new&nbsp;catapult shoes, National Basketball Association star Karl Malone says:&nbsp;&quot;Everything else is just hot air.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executives were enraged, calling the Reebok ads a cheap shot.&nbsp;And CBS actually pulled the L.A. Gear ad, saying the depiction of the&nbsp;catapult device in ads was misleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now British Knights is set to step on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> toes with a $ 15 million&nbsp;campaign, breaking Thursday, that features rapper M.C. Hammer hammering&nbsp;home the themeline &quot;Your mother wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not amused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That statement couldn't be further from the truth,&quot; Mr. Mooney&nbsp;says. &quot;But, to tell you the truth, we'd love it if everybody's mothers&nbsp;wore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;; Whims of war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the marketing war front:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta television station WSB has begun running twice-hourly local&nbsp;news inserts on Prime Cable broadcasts of CNN Headline News in the metro&nbsp;area. The local inserts, which a WSB spokeswoman said &quot;add an element of&nbsp;localism&quot; to Headline News's coverage, follow the boom in Cable News&nbsp;Network ratings since the war began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Guard this week is filming a commercial at Fort&nbsp;Benning, Ga., urging U.S. companies to back their employees who have been&nbsp;called up to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without the men and women in the National Guard, 44 percent of our&nbsp;nation's defense just wouldn't be there,&quot; says the commercial, being&nbsp;filmed by Detroit advertising agency Ross Roy. &quot;Be a hero. Give your&nbsp;employees the freedom to protect ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greeting card companies have begun selling cards with Persian Gulf&nbsp;war themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day Spring Greeting Cards, a Siloam Springs, Ark., manufacturer of&nbsp;religious greeting cards, is selling a line of &quot;With Love From Home&quot;&nbsp;cards at Christian bookstores and Wal-Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hallmark is selling a line of &quot;Just How I Feel&quot; cards to send to&nbsp;soldiers, offering &quot;missing you&quot; and &quot;thinking of you&quot; sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Greetings is offering a &quot;Greetings From The Gulf&quot; line of&nbsp;12 cards for soldiers to send home. The cards sport Desert Shield logos&nbsp;and pictures of camels and sand. They are sold in military stores&nbsp;overseas. Next week, the company will begin selling &quot;America Misses You&quot;&nbsp;cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally methodical marketers continue to be perplexed by the double&nbsp;whammy of war and recession. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. have&nbsp;chopped $ 240 million from their ad budgets. Meantime, others - including&nbsp;Audi, Coors, Sony and Warner Brothers - have shifted their ads from the&nbsp;cheaper media of cable and spot television onto the networks. Network&nbsp;advertising sales are so soft these days, it's sometimes cheaper than&nbsp;spot and cable TV.; Quickly ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the dust has settled from the C&amp;S/Sovran Corp. merger, the&nbsp;banking company plans to choose a single advertising agency. Company&nbsp;officials said Monday they are holding a review for the $ 10 million to&nbsp;$ 20 million account. The incumbents - Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Atlanta (C&amp;S's&nbsp;agency for more than a decade) and Sovran's agency, Lawler Ballard of&nbsp;Norfolk, Va., have been invited to pitch, of course. . . . The Los&nbsp;Angeles office of Delta Air Lines' advertising agency, BBDO, followed&nbsp;through on a report that its Moscow office was pitching the KGB account.&nbsp;The agency's creative team came up with this tongue-in-cheek ad - &quot;We&nbsp;Love to Spy, and It Shows.&quot; Others: &quot;We're not your father's KGB&quot;; and&nbsp;&quot;Gee! No. KGB.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEAVERTON, Ore. - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the largest athletic apparel maker in the world, has built its business by speaking to men.  If women were eavesdropping and understood the message - fine. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was happy to sell them smaller, pretty-color versions of its men's offerings.  In the industry, these are known as ''take-down'' products.  With that approach, it is little wonder that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> women's business has been only a trickle in the company's revenue stream. For the fiscal year ended May 31, it accounted for about 16 percent, or $480 million, of total revenues of $3 billion.  By comparison, Reebok International Ltd., the other industry titan, does about half its $2.16 billion annual sales in women's products.  But with the domestic men's market at its saturation point, Beaverton-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has acquired a fascination with women rivaling that of an adolescent boy.  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a male brand,'' says Kate Bednarski, marketing manager of women's fitness shoes for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''But we're now committed to growing our business on the other side of the channel.'' The commitment comes in the form of new head-to-toe women's collections - designed by women for women - and a critically acclaimed advertising campaign that says ''Just do it'' in a distinctly feminine voice heretofore unheard from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts and industry obser vers are generally enthusiastic about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> potential in the domestic women's market.  Overall, shoes alone in that market amount to about $3 billion annually if you figure in the whole spectrum from sneakers to highly engineered performance shoes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's $2 billion if you toss out the shoes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> types caustically refer to as ''foot coverings.'' Fitness apparel (other than footwear), a loosely defined category that includes about everything women don't wear to the office, is estimated at $16 billion a year; the sports-performance part of it that most interests </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes up about $2 billion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. yesterday named Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson to its board of directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman since 1980, becomes the first minority-race board member at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which expects $ 3 billion sales in sports and fitness shoes, clothing and accessories for its fiscal year ending May 31.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The naming of Thompson follows criticism last July by Operation PUSH and its leader, Jesse Jackson, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was exploiting blacks and had none in upper management. In August, Operation PUSH urged a boycott of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> publicly said it would name a black to its board within a year. The next month, Thompson arranged a meeting in his office between Operation PUSH and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had an opportunity to know [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chairman] Phil Knight,&quot; Thompson said on a tape provided by Georgetown. &quot;I have a lot of interest and a lot of curiosity, particularly as it applies to the business world. And this will afford me an opportunity to expand my knowledge and at least give some more input of my feelings about the business world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson will make $ 10,000 a year to sit on the board, plus $ 2,000 for each of six annual board meetings. His first board meeting is next month.</SPAN></P>

Avia seeks to block sales of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air 180 running shoes, which it says copy the Cantilever technology.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its counterclaim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. 1 in the athletic footwear industry, contends that Avia abandoned its original Cantilever outsole, rendering the patent invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add rehabilitation to the long list of skills that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. boasts Bo knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In new television commercials that begin next Tuesday, during CBS's telecast of the baseball All-Star Game, the nation's leading athletic shoe marketer will present the third annual installment in its &quot;Bo knows&quot; advertising series that has become as popular with ad-award committees as it is with sneaker-buying consumers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story line for the new spots, called the &quot;Bo Show,&quot; centers on the football injury suffered by Mr. Jackson that forced his release by the Kansas City Royals baseball team. That is yet another unexpected move by Wieden &amp; Kennedy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> iconoclastic ad agency in Portland, Ore., since many in the ad community predicted that Mr. Jackson's injury would end his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pitchman chores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an opportunity in everything,&quot; Scott Bedbury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising director, said yesterday. &quot;If anybody can make a comeback, it's Bo.&quot; The first &quot;Bo knows&quot; spot, in 1989, focused on Mr. Jackson's purported proficiency on guitar, while last year's boasted of his abilities in unexpected sports like auto racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of the new spots shows Mr. Jackson attempting a new career as a song-and-dance man, only to quit in mid-warble. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he tells a bevy of chorines dressed in football and baseball costumes who seem to be spoofing Ray Charles's Diet Pepsi &quot;Uh-huh&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson literally walks out of the commercial, by climbing out of a television set and into a family's living room, on his way to rehab. As he lifts weights and swims, attempting to get back in shape to join his new baseball team, the Chicago White Sox, he is interrupted by the chorines. When he refuses to rejoin them, the song-and-dance resumes with the boxer George Foreman -- another athlete on the comeback trail -- in Mr. Jackson's place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans other &quot;Bo show&quot; spots later this summer, one featuring Wayne Gretzy of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and another featuring baseball and football players: Jerry Rice (San Francisco 49ers), Darryl Strawberry (Los Angeles Dodgers), Randall Cunningham (Philadephia Eagles) and Eric Davis (Cincinnati Reds).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also during the All-Star Game, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to show new spots with the tennis star Andre Agassi; David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association, and the film director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the ultimate fan of Michael Jordan of the N.B.A.'s Chicago Bulls.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the National Sporting Goods Association's World Sports Expo&nbsp;opens a four-day run in Chicago July 15, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be conspicuous by its&nbsp;absence - and Atlanta's annual Super Show is the primary reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We figured we were seeing 95 percent of the same people we'd&nbsp;already seen at the Super Show,&quot; said Mikal Peveto, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marketing&nbsp;manager/running apparel, in Atlanta this week for the Peachtree Road&nbsp;Race. &quot;We looked at the cost - we were spending $ 4 million in Chicago -&nbsp;and decided to put that back into the retail segment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, that money will be spent on flying representatives of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top 100 accounts to its home office in Portland for an annual&nbsp;sales message, new product displays and other programs aimed at the&nbsp;retail market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will get plenty of exposure from a recently completed agreement&nbsp;with The Athletics Congress (TAC) in which the company will provide&nbsp;uniforms for the U.S. teams participating in the Pan American Games in&nbsp;Cuba, the World Track and Field Championships in Tokyo and the 1992&nbsp;Olympics in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Peveto, the company will supply shoes and apparel to&nbsp;TAC, but not money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will supply radical, bold uniforms, but uniforms that at the&nbsp;same time will be respectful of the games and the country,&quot; Peveto said.&nbsp;&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> philosophy is to push the envelope, so the public will see a bold&nbsp;interpretation of our nation's colors. It will be like pro tennis star)&nbsp;Andre Agassi, an attitude. The uniforms will make a statement. The&nbsp;attitude will be aggressive on race day. That fits the attitude of the&nbsp;United States. It's an aggressive, daring, prideful country and our&nbsp;uniforms will reflect that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOOT PATROL: While running the Peachtree 10K course last Sunday,&nbsp;Peveto occupied his mind by conducting an informal shoe count. In one&nbsp;hour, he counted more than 1,200 runners wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes (53 percent&nbsp;of his total; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> market share is 51 percent). By Peveto's count, 18&nbsp;percent of the runners wore Asics shoes, exactly that company's share. .&nbsp;. . Stan Clark, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Southeast footwear specialist, says his company&nbsp;would like to increase its visibility during the Peachtree Road Race and&nbsp;will approach the Atlanta Track Club about increasing the size of its&nbsp;sponsorship. . . . According to Linda Hannon, this year's Peachtree Road&nbsp;Race Expo - moved from Colony Square to the Swissotel at Lenox Square&nbsp;along with race headquarters - was the biggest ever with more than 60&nbsp;exhibitors. &quot;This Expo is for Jane and John Runner,' and we hope they&nbsp;enjoy it,&quot; said Hannon, who coordinates the Expo. &quot;We decided Buckhead&nbsp;was a more convenient location for the runners. Lenox Square definitely&nbsp;is the place to be on July 4 in Atlanta.&quot; . . . Athletics director Homer&nbsp;Rice has promoted and retitled several members of his staff at Georgia&nbsp;Tech, including Bernie McGregor (chief administrative officer), Kevin&nbsp;Bryant (assistant A.D./marketing) and Mike Finn (assistant&nbsp;A.D./communications). Jim Murphy will continue as chief financial&nbsp;officer. The changes will provide more authority for those working under&nbsp;Rice, who then will be able to devote more time to fund-raising and Tech's&nbsp; role in the 1996 Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASTRO-NOMICAL PRICE: John McMullen, owner of the Houston Astros, is&nbsp;trying to sell his team for $ 95 million, although a recent report in&nbsp;Financial World magazine assessed the club's value at $ 92 million. Among&nbsp;a group negotiating to buy the team is Charles Duncan, former president&nbsp;of Coca-Cola. . . . South Carolina will host its third annual&nbsp;International Conference on Sports Business April 1-4 next year,&nbsp;according to Jerry Kissel, a professor in the university's school of&nbsp;athletics administration. . . . Atlanta World Cup officials will narrow a&nbsp;list of four sites - the World Congress Center, Inforum, the&nbsp;International Trade and Convention Center and the old Sears building - as&nbsp;prospective locations for the 1994 soccer games' media center and&nbsp;international broadcast center. &quot;Hosting these centers would help&nbsp;solidify Atlanta as a communications and technology hub,&quot; said Atlanta&nbsp;World Cup chairman Lewis Holland. &quot;It offers us a continuing business&nbsp;opportunity with long-lasting benefits.&quot; Chicago, Dallas, Denver and&nbsp;Phoenix are the other finalists for the centers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; FEBRUARY 1989: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> designer Tinker Hatfield flew to Chicago for a meeting with Chicago Bulls guard Michael Jordan. They agreed that the '91 shoe would be lighter with a snugger fit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; FEBRUARY 1990: Jordan examined drawings of the shoe with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executives in Santa Monica, Calif. The shoe was too heavy; Jordan suggested removing some leather from its tip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; MARCH 1990: A rough prototype Air Jordan was shipped with technical specifications to the Fong Chuan Rubber Enterprise factory in Taiwan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sneakers are manufactured in the Far East because U.S. labor costs are &quot;no longer competitive,&quot; company chairman Phil Knight said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; AUGUST 1990: Production began with materials imported from Germany, Australia, Japan, Argentina and the United States. As many as 150 assembly-line workers were involved in stitching the shoe's perforated leather upper. Each pair took about two days to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; NOVEMBER 1990: About 170,000 pairs of sneakers were ready to be shipped. Cost to manufacture, box, crate and deliver one pair of Air Jordans to a port in Taiwan: $ 29.65.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; JANUARY 1991: The shoes arrived in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> distribution centers in Memphis, Portland, Ore. and Greenland, N.H.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; FEB. 4, 1991: Retail stores received their first shipments. Dealers' cost for each pair: $ 68.75.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; FEB. 10, 1991: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> introduced its lightest-ever Air Jordan -- a size nine weighs 15 1/2 ounces. A 30-second commercial featured singer Little Richard in the role of a &quot;genie in the lamp&quot; who granted Mars Blackmon (the Spike Lee character) one wish. Did Blackmon want $ 1 million? No. A new car? No. He only wanted a pair of . . . what else?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested retail price for the Air Jordan: $ 125.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Wieden &amp; Kennedy won the Subaru of America account, one of the agency's clients voiced an opinion widely shared among advertising, marketing and media executives: &quot;This will give them an opportunity,&quot; said Joseph W. Cece, president and publisher of TV Guide, &quot;to show that they can 'just do it' for somebody else as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cece's choice of words was, of course, no accident. In echoing the slogan the agency created for its largest and best-known client, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., he brought out the two conflicting implications of Wieden's long-shot victory last week in the fierce competition with Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver and four other agencies for Subaru's account.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On one hand, the victory offers opportunities to Wieden by catapulting the award-winning Portland, Ore., agency into the forefront of the industry's most powerful and influential shops. Subaru's estimated $70 million in billings will take Wieden, with approximate current billings of $175 million, out of the ranks of midsized agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet at the same time, it presents Wieden with the challenge of demonstrating an expertise beyond the agency's ability to convince consumers that the super-athlete Bo Jackson knows footwear.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>No 'Subaru Knows' or 'Nice Car'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Subaru is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Dan Wieden, the agency's president and co-creative director, said in a telephone interview last week. &quot;Nor are Subaru's customers necessarily the same as those of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he added. &quot;So we wouldn't try to do a 'Subaru knows.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No 'nice car,' &quot; chimed in David Kennedy, the agency's chairman and co-creative director, parodying the &quot;nice shoes&quot; line from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blockbuster commercial spoofing sports announcers, which was shown during the 1990 Super Bowl telecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought they would be only </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Barbara Lippert, advertising critic for the trade publication Adweek, &quot;but they have all this wonderfully smart, exciting, crackling, hip work.&quot; She is particularly taken with a provocative new television campaign introducing a line of Anne Klein clothing. Some of the spots show a couple in bed, moving around under the covers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Reputation Is 'Amazing'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Bob Garfield, Ms. Lippert's counterpart at the trade publication Advertising Age, said that &quot;about the only Wieden &amp; Kennedy work I see is for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is uniformly magnificent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of amazing that they've built the creative reputation they have on the basis of one high-profile national client,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, there are two. &quot;There's a lot to be learned for Wieden with another major account in the house besides </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Scott Bedbury, advertising director for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is based near the agency in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, Ore. &quot;It opens them up to a lot more consumer perspectives and a lot more client perspectives. It will balance out the agency, and that's great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wieden agrees. Adding a client of Subaru's size -- the Subaru account will rank second to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which, according to Advertising Age, spent $77.5 million last year -- is &quot;a big break for us,&quot; he said, &quot;a chance to get our work known in a different category.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Challenging a Belief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet he and his partner take issue with a widely held belief that an agency, even one with a reputation for cutting-through-the-clutter creativity like theirs, must have an automotive account to validate its standing among its peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Garfield described it, &quot;I think Jay Chiat&quot; -- the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day/Mojo, the innovative agency to which Wieden is often compared -- &quot;was a lot happier after he got Nissan than before he got Nissan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such thinking is &quot;probably one of the big problems with the industry right now,&quot; Mr. Wieden said. &quot;Less attention is paid to creative excellence than to which accounts an agency has or the size of its billings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among top executives of other agencies, especially those based on the East Coast, there are some perceptions of Wieden as iconoclastic, aloof, perhaps even a tad arrogant. They are uncomfortable with remarks of Mr. Wieden's that rarely get uttered by heads of top agencies. For instance, he dismisses most of what is spent on advertising in the United States as &quot;a waste&quot; and &quot;ad babble, like static on the airwaves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they point to the agency's refusal to join the industry's trade organization, the American Association of Advertising Agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't belong to the 4 A's,&quot; Mr. Wieden said, &quot;and I have no intention to. I don't mean this as arrogant, but I really don't care what the industry thinks of us. That's the wrong drummer to be marching to.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Not in the 'Belly of the Beast'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the agency's &quot;best work has never been applauded by the industry,&quot; he added, &quot;and some of our worst work has. We're trying to make ourselves valid to ourselves and to our clients.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assisting the agency in staying true to itself is its location in Portland, Mr. Wieden said, &quot;and not in the 'belly of the beast,' &quot; i.e., the East Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying what we're about is what everybody should be about,&quot; he added, &quot;but to exist out here and to do our thing is not to do what everyone else is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, to help land the Subaru account, Wieden opened an office that if not in the beast's belly is somewhere near its knee, in Mount Laurel, N.J., not far from Subaru's Cherry Hill, N.J., headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's first East Coast office is not likely to change its character, said Mr. Bedbury of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know Dan Wieden well enough to know that if he sensed any 'contamination,' he'd get out of it,&quot; Mr. Bedbury said. &quot;His real strength lies in the road not taken, so to speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes are having a good run at the Science Museum: on display are state-of-the-art trainers, pounds 89.99 on the high streets, the biggest draw for adolescent shoplifters and the kind of shoe kids get mugged for. The museum is not actually selling the shoes, but it has lent its name and given space to an exhibition devised by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a tie-in to a pounds 1.7m television advertising campaign for its new Air 180 shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strapped for cash, the museum is not trying to make a splash with the name of a commercial sponsor, however, even though it will have to drop plans for a new gallery of medicine if it fails to raise pounds 1m by the end of the year. Sports professionals may sign lucrative contracts to endorse one manufacturer's gear, but the museum is doing it for nothing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caroline Kay, head of external affairs for the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, described the arrangement as: ''Utterly astonishing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be laughing all the way to the ringing cash tills. Museums can't live in the markets part of the time and in cloud-cuckoo-land the rest, imagining they are totally pure because they haven't accepted money. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is getting a great deal of commercial benefit out of this association: the museum should be selling its own excellence rather than giving it away for free.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the first time that the Science Museum has run into criticism for generous product displays. Its permanent ''Food for Thought'' gallery has been slated for its reconstructions of a Sainsbury supermarket and a McDonald's burger bar. Over the road, the Victoria and Albert Museum was criticised for its exhibitions of Sock Shop designer tights and Burberry raincoats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Science Museum approached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the idea for the ''Running on Air'' exhibition. The argument is that it is interesting, scientifically valid and relevant to the visitor who doesn't make a habit of going to museums. This is true: 12-year-old boys, several wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of their own, were measuring their feet against their sports heros' shoes last week - Frank Bruno size 12, Ian Rush a dainty 71 2 - and guessing their high street prices. ''The public never pass comment on the level of branding. I think they would complain if it were unacceptable,'' said Caroline Nolan, the museum's public relations officer. This could be because the public thinks museum exhibitions are independent creations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general visitor would be hard put to gather that ''Running on Air'' is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show rather than the Science Museum's, when hoardings express the museum's gratitude to the company for its support rather than vice-versa. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is quite clear that it sees the exhibition as scientific endorsement of its brand image as more than a fashion shoe. ''It positions us as a serious brand,'' said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marketing services manager, Simon Taylor. ''We tried to get the exhibition up and running the day the new shoe hit the stores and we manned the stand for the first few weeks''. He could have been talking about a stand at a trade fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When an art gallery shows an exhibition of a living artist, that is a kind of endorsement and it has an effect on market values of the work,'' said Helen Rees, director of the Design Museum. But relations with manufacturing industry pose particular problems for museums of applied arts and sciences - relying on manufacturers as they must for contributions to their collections and up-to-date information from the front line. ''Make it an exhibition of sports shoes and people hop up and down,'' said Neil Cossons, the Science Museum's director. ''But was the museum endorsing Rolls-Royce jet engines in a previous exhibition? That was a product-related exhibition by a single manufacturer and I find it curious that people draw a distinction.'' Perhaps the distinction is that children are not in the market for jet engines. If there are controls against product endorsement by children's television, why not by national museums?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If museums bring in exhibitions designed by outside - and interested - parties, perhaps they should make a clearer distinction between ''museum space'' and ''private space''. It is an option the V &amp; A will consider next year when new display areas become available at the end of their ''Japan in Perspective'' exhibition. ''If we have a major exhibition sponsor manufacturing products that are relevant to our collections, we could show additional material - perhaps from their archives - making it quite clear that it is not part of the exhibition itself,'' said Sally Mason, the V &amp; A development director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who argue that sponsors may try to assert control over an exhibition are probably mistaken. Patrick Greene, director of the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, where British Nuclear Fuels gave pounds 73,000 to a new energy gallery, stressed that it was not until the last minute that BNFL asked for details of what would be on display. In the event, it disagreed with some of the contents - such as a picture of a bovine Chernobyl victim that came from a Soviet newsagency. The cow stayed: ''We stressed from the start that it was the museum's exhibition. BNFL would not have dreamt of interfering,'' said Dr Greene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greater danger could be self-censorship with a museum inclined to tone down aspects of an exhibition that might upset a sponsor. ''Self-censorship is definitely a danger and any museum needs to be aware of it, but another danger is under-valuing what a museum has to offer,'' Dr Greene said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely one of a museum's most valuable assets is its reputation for academic integrity untainted by commerce - the reputation that makes business want to associate with museums in the first place. Perhaps the Science Museum should ask itself whether it is selling itself cheap to the shoe industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction in connection with its complaint for trademark infringement and unfair competition by defendant, a manufacturer in the business of making, promoting, and selling shoes, clothing, and accessories bearing the alleged infringing trademark in its logo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff maintained that defendant's trademark in its current lettering style resembled plaintiff's trademark. The court agreed, finding that the first and dominant half of both trademarks were identical. Because plaintiff had a strong likelihood of success on the merits and showed a great possibility of irreparable harm, the court ordered defendant immediately restrained and enjoined from advertising or promoting its products displaying the trademark and logo in television, radio, print, packaging, posters, and retail outlet graphic materials and from offering to sell, selling, or distributing its products displaying the trademark. The court found it inconceivable that defendant did not realize how closely its trademark was to plaintiff's trademark. Moreover, given that the likelihood of confusion caused by the aural similarity of the two trademarks in light of defendant's admitted use of radio and television advertising, and given that defendant was aware of the risks in building up its inventory during the pendency of the motion for preliminary injunction, the court set bond in the amount $ 100,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9"> OPINION<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORDER Re Preliminary Injunction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause came before the Court on plaintiff, Sideout Sport, Inc.'s (&quot;Sideout&quot;) Motion for a Preliminary Injunction in connection with its complaint for trademark infringement and unfair competition. The Court considered said motion, the complaint, the papers filed in support thereof and in opposition thereto, and heard oral argument. After careful consideration of the above, the Court issued an Order Re Motion for Preliminary Injunction on November 27, 1991, which is incorporated by reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In granting Sideout's motion, the Court rules as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEREAS defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. is currently manufacturing, promoting and selling shoes, clothing and accessories bearing the, trademark &quot;SIDE 1&quot; in its current lettering style and/or the SIDE 1 TRISM logo/design; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEREAS plaintiff Sideout&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sport, Inc. has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEREAS plaintiff Sideout Sport, Inc. has shown a great possibility of irreparable harm;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> its officers, representatives, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who receive actual notice of this Order by personal service or otherwise, pending the determination at a trial on the merits of this cause, be hereby and immediately restrained and enjoined from:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Advertising or promoting shoes, clothing and accessories displaying the trademark &quot;SIDE 1&quot; in its current lettering style, including but not limited to advertising or promotion on television, radio, print, packaging, posters, and retail outlet graphic materials; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Advertising or promoting shoes, clothing and accessories displaying the TRISM logo/design, including but not limited to advertising or promotion on television, radio, print, packaging, posters, and retail outlet graphic materials; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Offering to sell, selling, or distributing shoes, clothing and accessories displaying the trademark &quot;SIDE 1&quot; in its current lettering style or the TRISM logo/design as or as part of any trademark, brand name or other business&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or commercial designation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court makes the following additional findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Court previously ruled that the evidence as to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intent is inconclusive, upon further and considerable reflection, the Court finds that, it is inconceivable that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not realize how closely its &quot;SIDE 1&quot; trademark in its current elongated lettering style resembles Sideout's trademark, even to the extent that the first and dominant half of both trademarks are identical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds that the likelihood of confusion caused by the aural similarity of the two trademark is particularly important in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> admitted use of radio and television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court finds that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was aware of the risks involved in building up its Side 1 inventory during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction which was filed in June 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the Court's findings as set forth in Court's November 27, 1991 Order and above, and in conjunction with Sideout's showing with respect to its financial situation, the Court sets bond in the amount $ 100,000. This Order shall be effective upon the posting of said bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS SO ORDERED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DATED: December 18, 1991</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Store manager and ex-football star Paul Weston said the margin</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is due to $7 a pair in quota costs and 45 per cent in</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Brian Fawcett<BR> ESQUIRE magazine, which carries the subtitle of Man At His Best but<BR>really ought to be subtitled Upper Middle-class New York Guys Between 35<BR>and 50 At Their Most Cynical and Stylish, used to be one of the best<BR>magazines this side of the Atlantic. It was politically and socially<BR>astute if not always liberal, the prose was high-octane, and its annual<BR>Dubious Achievement Awards, begun in the 1960s, were the best summary and<BR>satire of our lunatic civilization available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    These days, alas, the magazine is usually more in step with our<BR>paranoid sectarian times than it once was, and the most I'd be willing to<BR>say about it is that it features good prose. The April 1991 issue, which<BR>exhibits a photo of actress Ellen Barkin, has, between pages 64 and 65, an<BR>eight-page fold-out that will tell you more about corporate sponsorship of<BR>the arts than the magazine intended, and probably a whole lot more than<BR>most of us ever wanted to know.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the front and back of the fold-out are miniaturized reproductions of<BR>five commissioned works of art. Charles Anderson (U.S.), Ralph Steadman<BR>(British) and Takenobu Igarushi (Japanese) are on the front, and Alphonse<BR>Holtgreve (German) and Andre Francois (French) cover the rear. All five<BR>artists were evidently contracted to interpret a single numerical icon -<BR>the number 180 - and to integrate it within what is presumably their<BR>recognizable style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE perpetrator is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corp., whose slogan, &quot;Just do it,&quot; has become<BR>the low-density battle cry for a generation of narcissistic physical<BR>activists engaged in slicking up their bodies while a third of the world<BR>suffers from malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offending fold-out is an ad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new running shoe, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">180 Air. The middle four pages are a masterpiece of high-style technical<BR>gibberish about the new runner, done up in neo-Albrecht Durer with water-<BR>colour renderings first of the shoe, and then of a skinless foot sitting<BR>in it. Also included are a nonsensical architectural plan view of the<BR>shoe's sole, and a couple of indecipherable technical drawings aimed at<BR>convincing us of the 180's high-tech perfection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The written text, printed in Spanish, German, Japanese and English,<BR>informs us that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vaunted air-cushioning unit (a see-through shell<BR>that contains air and thus makes the shoe lighter), has been made 50 per<BR>cent larger for the 180 runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the two remaining pages of the fold-out are silver-tone cheesecake<BR>photos of the new 180 in hot pink, navy and white. With its see-through<BR>air unit, the runner doesn't quite strike me as the Ellen Barkin of<BR>running shoes, who is after all, a woman of complexity and substance. The<BR>180 is actually the opposite - a testimony to the degree to which<BR>absolutely nothing can be aggrandized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what am I offended at, here, anyway? Well, practically everything<BR>about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fold-out offends me. Nowhere in the eight pages does it<BR>admit that it is an advertisement. Au contraire, the fold-out is marked &quot;<BR>confidential&quot; in five places, leading us to believe that it must be an<BR>information leak that Esquire somehow got hold of. That it is addressed to<BR>someone named T. Hatfield, a name that does not appear on the Esquire<BR>masthead, seems to confirm this. The apparent authours of the information<BR>leak are three guys in Beaverton, Ore., which is presumably the site of<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> design headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT what is most offensive here is that it tells us how the corporate<BR>sector will, in the end, nurture and sponsor the arts. In this case, the<BR>work of five-star visual artists serves as the fold-out's cover<BR>decoration, and, by implication, as an illustration of how interested in<BR>helping out the arts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also tells us that after a half-century of trying to integrate the<BR>arts within the communities whose values and problems they are supposed to<BR>reflect and articulate, we're headed back to the dark days when art wasn't<BR>by the masters, but for them.<BR> Brian Fawcett is a Vancouver writer and author of Public Eye: An<BR>Investigation into the Disappearance of the World (Harper Collins).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are famous new voices in the ongoing jibes between Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new $ 20 million ad campaign for its Pump sneakers, Reebok airs six TV spots using athletes as spokesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both companies say it's the first time athlete endorsers have taken shots at the competition. It has also prompted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to consider legal action, says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad manager Scott Bedbury, because ''after a callous attack, you can't sit on the sidelines.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reebok ads implicitly tweak </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorsers. Consumers are meant to think of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Jordan when Reebok's Dominique Wilkins says, ''Michael, my man, if you want to fly first class,'' switch to Pumps. Reebok decathlete Dave Johnson says, ''I'm the man who knows cross-training,'' not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bo Jackson. Reebok's Boomer Esiason is more direct: ''Boomer knows something that Bo don't know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bedbury says, ''It saddens us to see (endorsers) misused or abused. ... This doesn't bode well for the ad industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok marketing vice president David Ropes says the ads just reflect reality. ''Athletes' egos are so huge they needle each other. This banter is their professional jargon. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is just blowing smoke.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there's smoke, there's publicity - and that helps both companies. ''In the world of competitive noise, both of us benefit,'' says Reebok's Ropes. ''We're battling for a share of consumers' minds.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR> PUNCH PITCH: The World Boxing Council is considering selling licensed merchandise and might even try to improve its image through a consumer ad campaign. The WBC, a leading boxing sanctioning group, has hired the New York ad agency Taylor-Gordon, Aarons &amp; Co. to publicize its pension programs and support of medical research. ... Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in free-market economist Milton Friedman's five-part TV series Free to Choose, starting Sunday on CNBC. ''I came from a socialistic country, Austria, (where) you can hear 18-year-old kids already talking about their pension. But me, I wanted more.'' ... ... Junior college quarterback John Kaleo, who signed Wednesday with University of Maryland, shows how sponsors can leave an impression. ''The Weed Eater Bowl,'' Kaleo told The (Baltimore) Sun, ''solidified my decision.'' Maryland tied Louisiana Tech 34-34 in the Poulan/Weed Eater Independence Bowl last December.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a darkened conference room in suburban New Jersey, the team from Wieden &amp; Kennedy Inc. rolled out the campaign they hoped would win them $ 70 million worth of advertising business from Subaru of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their ads were different from other car ads. Their strategy was different from anything Subaru had done before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen minutes into the spiel, the projector jammed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''From the back of the room, Dan Wieden said, 'You get the feeling we don't do this very often?' '' recalls Chris Wackman, Subaru's vice president of marketing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not exactly the slick presentation one might expect from the agency that creates ads for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., whose athletic-shoe ads are among the smoothest, hippest, star-packed spots on the airwaves. But Subaru loved it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There was a sort of self-deprecating air to them when they came in,'' Wackman says. ''It really set the feeling that these are Subaru people. Subaru people are not highfalutin people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wieden &amp; Kennedy got the account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're not highfalutin, and they're not from Madison Avenue. Since its founding in 1982, Wieden &amp; Kennedy has made a point of its slightly different worldview - the U.S. consumer as seen from its Portland, Ore., headquarters. There, they created ''Just do it'' and ''Bo knows'' and ''Nice shoes,'' won a closetful of awards that they claim not to care about and earned a reputation as the hottest of hot West Coast ad shops, an agency that made good on the claim all agencies make - to value creativity above all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, Wieden &amp; Kennedy has the most mainstream of clients - a car company. Its billings have gone from about $ 170 million to $ 240 million. And, to handle Subaru, it is opening an office across the continent in decidedly unglamorous Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It took a while to sink in. The whole employee body was in a state of shock,'' says Dan Wieden, 46, who founded the agency in 1982 with David Kennedy, 51, a co-worker at McCann-Erickson. ''It was like: Dog chases car, dog catches car, now what does dog do?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Dave Luhr, who oversees the Subaru campaign, already on the air: ''It's like Walden Pond, this agency: It's an experiment. No one wants to see the experiment ruined. There's a lot of concern that we do this thing right, that we don't blow it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, going after Subaru's advertising account was a carefully considered step for the agency, a rite of passage not unlike the day in 1986 when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upped its spending with the agency to the then-enormous sum of $ 12 million. ''We realized, 'Jiminy Christmas, we need to be an advertising agency,' '' Wieden says. Wieden &amp; Kennedy creates ads for the Oregon Tourism Council, Anne Klein clothes and Pepe Jeans. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - which, according to Advertising Age spent $ 179 million on advertising last year - is by far the agency's dominant client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're not eager to grow as an agency, but we did have to diversify a bit,'' says Luhr. ''We're out to prove that we can build a success story in something other than the sneaker business. That'll be good for us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also wanted to prove that an agency famed for its creativity could cut it in media strategy, planning where and when to run the ads to reach the right people. The agency handles only part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> media business. For Subaru, Wieden &amp; Kennedy suggested concentrating ad spending on the regional markets where Subaru sells best: More than 80% of the company's sales are in just 68 of 210 markets nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winning the media account ''was almost as exciting as winning the creative account,'' says Luhr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luhr is one of five emissaries from Portland assigned to carry the Wieden &amp; Kennedy culture cross-country - and teach it to the 30 new employees he is hiring to work on the Subaru campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was very important to bring some people out here so we didn't just slap a logo on the side of the agency,'' he says. Right now, the logo is a piece of paper taped to the glass door of a bland office suite once occupied by AT&amp;T - temporary surroundings that visibly embarrass the occupants.  Like most ad agencies, Wieden &amp; Kennedy views its office as a canvas on which to express its personality. ''People who visit it have to feel there's something exciting here,'' says Vince Engel, one of the creative directors of the Philadelphia office. ''It has to be stimulating.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Portland headquarters, in a 19th-century building downtown, gets its excitement from the basketball court built in the middle - which serves as a recreation area, meeting room, party room, theater and the psychic center of the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So will the Philadelphia office, when they find one - preferably in an old downtown building with character. Until now, the staff makes do with a set of brightly colored plastic bowling pins lying on the floor near a bin with a sign that says, ''Recycle, dudes. Thanks.'' They've eaten a Philly cheesesteak or two. They're noticing a definite lack of plaid shirts and beards, typical Portland attire. And they endure the thirtysomething jokes: ''Everybody asks if we've taken over (fictional ad agency DAA's) office space or if we live in Hope and Michael's house,'' says Christine Barrett, who came from Portland to supervise setting up the new office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia agency eventually will search out new business on its own. But the umbilical cord will stay uncut. ''The last thing I want to do is distance myself from Portland,'' says Engel. ''You don't want to rely on them as a crutch. But that's the mother ship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A filmmaker is being dispatched from Portland to shoot film of Philadelphia to show the folks back home - and vice versa. A foreign-exchange program between offices, as Dan Wieden puts it, is being planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Philadelphia is on the East Coast, it's no New York - an important point to the agency. ''Philly is a different kind of city. It's stuck between (Washington) D.C. and New York, and it's fighting for its pride, and that's a good place for us to be,'' says Luhr. Like in Portland - and unlike in New York, whose residents are acknowledged to be unlike any others on the planet - ''we'll still be just as close to our target audience'' in Philadelphia, says Luhr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That closeness is part of Wieden &amp; Kennedy's appeal to clients. ''Their creative team is used to working with the same age group as we are,'' says Zoe Campbell, marketing manager for Pepe Clothing USA. ''The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basis that they have helps a lot. They understand our target market.'' Sometimes they virtually are the target market: Subaru's highest market penetration in the country is in Bend, Ore., about -160 miles from Portland. Says Engel, who arrived in Philadelphia this month from ad agency Ayer/New Zealand: ''The agency is so unpretentious. Maybe that's why they understand who they're talking to better.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep their much-vaunted fresh perspective, Wieden &amp; Kennedy hires young people, often not from conventional advertising backgrounds, and pairs them with experienced talent. Copywriter Janet Champ started out as a receptionist, ''wasn't very good there, moved into finance, completely screwed up our books,'' Wieden says, and then went on to create ''Revolution,'' an early breakthrough ad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its acclaimed magazine ads for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We really wanted a place where people could come and live up to their potential,'' Wieden says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the agency itself is doing the same thing, everyone's a little nervous. In an industry where ''big agency'' is usually equated with ''bad agency,'' everyone suffers ''the fear of growing too big,'' says Engel. ''We're very aware and fearful of that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Although we're a lot larger now, there still needs to be a sense of freedom and experimentation that's part of this shop,'' Wieden says. ''Sort of like Peter Pan, I'd like to get bigger but not grown-up.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Thompson, the renowned Georgetown University basketball coach, is good at what he does -- and that's not limited to coaching. He likes his players to be fine students as well as fine athletes, and in this and other ways he proves that he is a man of some values. One of them, unfortunately, is to sound like Adam Smith's parrot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capitalism, capitalism, Thompson squawks when asked about the $ 200,000 or so he gets annually from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes. In exchange, Thompson shoes his team in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He makes public appearances for the firm. He acts as one of their spokesmen, and he tried, without success, to broker a deal between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Jesse Jackson over minority hiring and other such matters. Even Big John Thompson doesn't win them all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, then capitalism must run it a close second. It's often invoked as a lame excuse, an attempt to duck a moral argument by saying all ways of earning money are equal. But across town from Georgetown is the University of the District of Columbia. It's the city's public institution of higher learning, and many of its students are poor. On its basketball team is one Keith Goodie. He owns 56 pairs of sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodie is to sneakers what Imelda Marcos was to pumps. In his addiction, he is in no way typical, but he is representative. He told The Post he doesn't know anyone who doesn't own at least 25 pairs. To this, people in the sneaker business would only shrug their shoulders in cynical acknowledgment: What else is new? They know that athletic shoes make a major fashion and status statement in the inner city. Lots of poor kids have dozen of pairs, and they are the shoes of preference for drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson had his own differences with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But when it comes to sneakers in general, what he says makes sense. These shoes, selling for as much as $ 135 a pair, are symbolic of an urge to showboat. They are worn by kids whose pride, whose entire self-esteem, is on their feet or on their backs. They spend recklessly because they think they have no future, and they have no future because, among other reasons, they have little self-discipline. Jackson to his credit says so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It goes without saying that poor people have little money. But they often lack something else as well: a refusal to postpone gratification. Whether it's having a child when too young or squandering money on athletic shoes, this behavior is characteristic of the culture of poverty. So, too, in a way is basketball. It's a game of youth that promises an almost instant payoff for the extremely talented. But as a way out of poverty, it has the long odds of a lottery: just a handful win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson and the other coaches who have contracts with shoe firms surely understand the lure of basketball and the impact famous coaches have. But instead of acknowledging that their endorsements only reinforce a destructive mentality, they proclaim a mindless allegiance to the free-market system. &quot;So all of a sudden it's a sin in this society for a person to be capitalistic?&quot; Thompson said. &quot;But as long as I live in America, that's exactly what I am going tobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble is, Thompson's role as a capitalist is in direct conflict with his role as a mentor to young black athletes and, since basketball is king, to young black males in general. When his team takes the court with everyone wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, not only do the people in the arena notice but so does everyone watching television. After all, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is paying him big bucks expecting a big payoff. Here is the ultimate in false values: a team wearing a certain shoe so that the coach can make a buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what if Thompson allowed his players to wear any shoe they wanted? What if kids all over America could see that one sneaker is very little different from another and their obsession with name brands (at incredible profit margins) marks them as suckers? What if they gleaned the message that the shoes and their look didn't matter at all, but that performance was everything? Isn't that a lesson that transcends shoes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all that ails the black underclass, a weakness for expensive sneakers is hardly the most serious. But as Jesse Jackson knows, it is representative of a larger problem, one personified by a college student who squanders his money on shoes -- making rich people even richer and himself a bit poorer. In this regard, John Thompson and other basketball coaches offer nothing in the way of rebuke. In perhaps the most important respect, the coach is not coaching.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE latest volley in the sneaker wars will be fired tonight during the Grammy Awards show in commercials for British Knights athletic shoes that use an updated version of a classic insult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $15 million campaign, created by the Deutsch agency, uses the theme &quot;Your mother wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- choose change,&quot; to warn young buyers that wearing sneakers from the older, more established market leader is &quot;un-cool.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donny Deutsch, the agency's executive vice president and creative director, said the company wanted to use a twist on &quot;Your mother wears combat boots&quot; to make the point that Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were no longer on the cutting edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be seen as the sneakers for rebellious young people,&quot; he added. &quot;Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have become so mainstream they're the sneaker of choice for little old ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make that point, one commercial features a group of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-clad, gray-haired women gossiping as they lounge around a tennis court. The spot tells viewers to &quot;choose change,&quot; then shows a lineup of flashy British Knights shoes decorated with brightly colored stripes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ad tells young viewers that even though they inherited their parents' genes, they need not follow in mom and dad's footsteps, implying that the only &quot;hip&quot; sneakers are British Knights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From a technical standpoint, all of the shoes are basically the same,&quot; said Larry Schwartz, an executive vice president at British Knights, which are made by Jack Schwartz Shoes Inc., New York. &quot;We think we can stand out by being more fashion-oriented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. did not return calls yesterday seeking comment on the British Knights campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potshots from British Knights are part of an increasingly aggressive battle being waged by sneaker makers. Earlier this year, Reebok International began a campaign that taunted the athletes Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson, well-known endorsers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one spot for the Reebok Pump sneaker, which has an inflatable sole that the wearer can adjust by squeezing a bulb in the shoe's tongue, Dominique Wilkins, the Atlanta Hawks basketball player, says, &quot;So Michael, my man, if you want to fly first class . . . pump up and air out,&quot; as he tosses away a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air sneaker, which has an air-filled sole but is not adjustable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, L. A. Gear Inc. has been running a commercial for its Catapult sneaker that uses the slogan &quot;Everything else is just hot air&quot; to take a shot at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising in the $5.5 billion sneaker category has become more aggressive as growth in the market has slowed and the industry's leaders have found it difficult to gain a technological edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending on sneaker advertising has risen substantially. Last year, the top three companies -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reebok and L. A. Gear -- increased ad expenditures from an estimated $70 million in 1989 to about $115 million. Mr. Schwartz, whose company is ranked No. 7 in the industry, said that on average, sneaker companies spend from 5 percent to 7 percent of total retail sales on advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason for the jump in spending is the hefty fees paid to well-known athletes like Mr. Jordan and Mr. Jackson, who get $5 million to $10 million for endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flood of sports celebrities in sneaker ads has drawn criticism from some agency executives who said the glut of personalities tended to cause confusion and made it hard for consumers to remember which sports stars wore what shoes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the nation's largest marketer of athletic shoes, reported today that its third-quarter earnings jumped 12 percent, but the performance disappointed Wall Street and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock price tumbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company earned $70.7 million, or 93 cents a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28, up from $63.1 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said revenues shot up nearly 39 percent in the third quarter to $802.2 million from $577.9 million a year earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the New York Stock Exchange, the company's class B stock tumbled $2.50, to $47.50 a share. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> share earnings were at the low end of Wall Street forecasts, which ranged from 90 cents to $1.05 a share, according to analysts at Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said higher costs had cut revenues, reflecting advertising expense for the introduction of several new products. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it planned to continue its heavy advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selling and administrative costs as a proportion of sales rose to 22.7 percent, from 19.9 percent last year. Interest costs in the quarter jumped to $9.7 million, from $2.5 million, partly reflecting higher borrowings to accommodate a planned rise in inventories.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stockholders and baseball card investors don't know about Bo - and the uncertainty took a toll yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the Beaverton, Ore. athletic footwear giant for which baseball and football star Bo Jackson did the popular ''Bo Knows'' ad campaign, plunged US$3 3/4 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange before rallying late in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock closed down US$1 3/4 at US$45 3/4 after falling US$2 1/2 on Monday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dropped US$1 5/8 on Friday, when reports that Jackson's injury could be career-threatening began to receive widespread circulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chance that the Los Angeles Raider running back and ex-Kansas City Royal outfielder may never play again has also prompted dumping of Jackson's baseball cards at big discounts, according to Jeff Kurowski, the baseball price guide co-ordinator for the respected Sports Collector's Digest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1986 Topps Traded card which was selling Monday for US$10 dropped to US$5 with news of Jackson's release by the Royals, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''A lot of large quantities of his cards are being dumped,'' Kurowski said. ''We haven't seen a lot of activity in his football cards yet. But I imagine it will be the same result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''A lot of the value in Bo was built because he was in the national spotlight and the expectations in both sports were so high. Now it just might turn out to be unrealized potential.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Wall Street analyst says not all the blame for the stock's drop should be attributed to Jackson's injury. Heidi Steinberg of Salomon Bros. in New York said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earnings report, released Monday, showed ''expenses have increased, particularly selling expenses and interest costs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Liz Dolan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vice-president of corporate communications, said she's puzzled by the drop in share price.''Earnings were up and the price goes down. But the stock market is very emotional; Bo's injury could have something to do with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Jackson became </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most famous spokesman in 1988, sales of cross-trainers have grown to US$350 million (C$400 million). Bo's contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> runs through 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackson was on crutches yesterday as he visited his former teammates in the Royals' clubhouse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A year earlier, the sports shoe and apparel maker earned US$58.1 million (C$66.4 million), or US77 cents a share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight indicated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per-share earnings for the recently completed second quarter ranged from US75 cents to US80 cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has commonly reported big quarterly earnings jumps, but a flat second quarter would be something of a victory in these recessionary times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Knight declined to give specific estimates and didn't discuss revenues for the period. A year ago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had revenues of US$648.8 million.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the fiscal first quarter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earned US$114.4 million (US$1.50 a share) on revenue of US$947.2 million. Fiscal first quarter earnings were 15% above profits in the year-earlier first quarter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By JAN WONG<BR>China may be Stalin's last stand, but communism is losing the battle in<BR>Guangdong, the bustling Chinese province closest to Hong Kong. The<BR>Cantonese have seen the future and it works. And they work, too. Traffic<BR>jams are so bad that peddlers turn a quick yuan hawking fruit in the<BR>street. The masses may still pedal Flying Pigeon bicycles, but the nouveau<BR>riche zip around on motorcycles or drive their own cars. You can spot<BR>them, armed with portable phones, feasting on seafood in Canton<BR>(Guangzhou), the frenetic capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Chinese centre of gravity is shifting south. In 1979, in an effort<BR>to jump-start China's economy, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made Guangdong<BR>a laboratory for testing economic reforms. Deng gave Guangdong the right,<BR>for instance, to approve huge foreign investments independent of the<BR>central government. In 1980, he set up China's first special economic zone<BR>in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, three million Cantonese work in joint ventures, earning two to<BR>five times as much as the 4.5 million workers who toil for the state. With<BR>64 million people, Guangdong ranks fifth in population among China's 30<BR>provinces and municipalities, but is first in exports, industrial<BR>production and foreign investment. &quot;We report to the Central Committee,<BR>but they hardly ever interfere,&quot; says Li Chunhong, one of Guangdong's new<BR>economic wizards. The reason: Beijing desperately needs cash to shore up<BR>ailing state industries in the rest of China. Last year, for example,<BR>Guangdong paid Beijing a total of 5 billion yuan ($1 Canadian=4.7 yuan) in<BR>taxes, about 25% of the province's gross revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go-go Guangdong is about as close as China gets to an independent<BR>republic. The Cantonese use their new-found wealth to flout Beijing's one-<BR>child limit. They have an extra child, pay the 10,000 yuan fine and just<BR>work harder. While Beijing's hard liners forced out Guangdong's free-<BR>thinking governor, Ye Xuanping, after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the<BR>showdown lasted months and in October he still hadn't budged from the<BR>governor's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Brown, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s China general manager, cites a Chinese<BR>proverb in explanation of Guangdong's free-thinking ways: &quot;The heavens are<BR>high and the emperor is far away&quot; (about 2,000 kilometres to the north, in<BR>fact). &quot;That could well be the motto on the Canton city crest,&quot; he says.<BR>Adds a Canton-based diplomat: &quot;The Cantonese barely pay lip service to<BR>Beijing. If they do, they're being sarcastic.&quot; The contrarian Cantonese<BR>have even embraced Mao, long on the outs in Beijing. The Great Helmsman's<BR>picture is pasted on bus windows as accident insurance. Shopkeepers<BR>display it to ward off bankruptcy. The new rich tape pictures of Mao to<BR>their pagers. &quot;Some people are just superstitious. Others use it to show<BR>their displeasure with all the corruption,&quot; said Li Chunhong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State radio stations in Canton play rock 'n' roll and pointedly<BR>announce the time as &quot;Beijing time.&quot; The rest of China may synchronize its<BR>watches with the capital, but Guangdong goes by Hong Kong time, partly so<BR>it can tune in to Hong Kong television shows. Disc jockeys here sign off<BR>in English with a perky &quot;bye-bye.&quot; And in a country where free speech is<BR>considered as dangerous as AIDS, there are even call-in radio talk shows.<BR>A recent topic: vacation hot spots, including Thailand and Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumption is the new god of Guangdong. Billboards tout Coke, Pepsi,<BR>Dunhill cigarettes and Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. Heinz even advertises<BR>baby food on the schedule screens at Canton's airport. Some streets retain<BR>politically correct names such as Liberation Road and East Wind Street,<BR>but it's hard to find a slogan anywhere. Instead, banners exhort:<BR>&quot;Citizens have the duty to pay taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, of course, a dark side to the explosion of wealth. In the<BR>last few years, have-nots from other provinces have flooded Guangdong in<BR>search of work. Unlike other Chinese cities, Canton has a sizable<BR>population of beggars and homeless. A sign underneath a new elevated<BR>highway admonishes: &quot;No sleeping under the bridge.&quot; Many blame the have-<BR>nots for the current crime wave. Outside the teeming railway station,<BR>pickpockets work the crowds. Wanted posters of thieves are plastered on<BR>buildings. After several drivers were murdered last year, many taxis<BR>installed New York-style steel barriers between driver and passenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the people of Guangdong, capitalism is bringing new prosperity.<BR>Factories hum through the night. In the first six months of 1991,<BR>Guangdong's output grew at an energetic 27.6%, compared with only 10% for<BR>the country as a whole. And while the economy is expected to slow down<BR>slightly next year, to about 6% overall for China, forecasts for Guangdong<BR>say it will continue to enjoy double-digit growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people here like to work,&quot; says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown. His company found<BR>that wasn't true in the rest of China. Since 1981, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has opened eight<BR>factories in China, but its best experiences have been in Guangdong. There<BR>it has been allowed to strike deals with Taiwanese investors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now<BR>happily deals with Taiwanese-run factories. &quot;I would match the quality we<BR>get out of here with anything out of Asia,&quot; says Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, problems remain. Government officials say that foreign<BR>companies skim off the best workers, but don't provide pensions or<BR>housing. And military officials fret that recruitment is down. People<BR>would rather work for foreign factories than join the poorly paid army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complains of power outages and arbitrary import duties that vary<BR>by as much as 30% from day to day for the same item. Others carp about<BR>bribes to Chinese officials. Nor are joint ventures immune from meddling.<BR>M.C. Packaging Ltd., which makes soft drink cans, saw its business nose-<BR>dive after Premier Li Peng casually remarked that canned drinks were a<BR>luxury China couldn't afford. For several years, canned drink orders from<BR>politically correct factories, mines and hotels dried up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these hassles, about 40% of China's 29,000 joint ventures have<BR>chosen Guangdong. &quot;It's easier to get things done here. There's less<BR>bureaucracy,&quot; says Samantha Kong, acting sales manager of Avon Products<BR>Inc.'s China venture. Avon, which began selling cosmetics in China in<BR>November, 1990, says initial sales were four to six times its estimates.<BR>To sop up revenues, it computerized its billing system several years ahead<BR>of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M.C. Packaging said it recovered its original $18-million (U.S.)<BR>investment in 22 months. The company, owned partly by Muncie, Ind.-based<BR>Ball Corp., credits its energetic Cantonese staff. Middle managers<BR>routinely work until 3 a.m., sometimes sleeping in the factory. &quot;In Hong<BR>Kong you don't have management like that. There's lots of grumbles if you<BR>ask them to work hard,&quot; says Kay Mak, M.C.'s general manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Heinz-UFE Ltd., the Chinese partners balked at participating in a<BR>second-phase investment of $4 million (U.S.) in 1986. But Heinz, confident<BR>it was tapping into a dream market-millions of parents coddling an only<BR>child-paid the whole shot, raising its stake to 80% from 60%. In 1990,<BR>Heinz turned a profit and now churns out 10,000 tonnes of infant cereal a<BR>year. &quot;We're selling it as fast as we can make it,&quot; says Huang Xian,<BR>Heinz's Chinese deputy general manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State factories also enjoy greater flexibility in Guangdong. Bei<BR>Zhaohan, head of White Cloud Mountain Pharmaceutical Plant, runs his 8,000<BR>workers with capitalist-style carrots and sticks. Workers use punch clocks<BR>and are paid by the piece. Technicians in research and development get two<BR>or three times more pay than ordinary workers, a heresy in the land of the<BR>dictatorship of the proletariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With at least 40% of state enterprises losing money, the nation's<BR>central planners are frustrated because they are losing control of the<BR>economy. The death of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was<BR>another blow to the hard-line Chinese leadership. But every time Beijing<BR>tries to rein in Guangdong, the Cantonese bounce back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some think it's hard to tell who's reining in whom these days. Will<BR>this capitalist revolution instead transform the rest of China-and spark<BR>lasting political change? Li, the economic official, spent 15 days touring<BR>the Soviet Union in 1989 and is convinced political reform alone does<BR>little good. &quot;It's better to carry out economic reform well.&quot; His voice<BR>drops. &quot;Then slowly have political reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, politics is serenely absent from Guangdong. At M.C. Packaging,<BR>the Communist Party secretary is mainly useful in his other role as union<BR>chief. &quot;If I want people to work on a public holiday, I just tell him and<BR>he handles it,&quot; says Mak. At </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Brown is taken aback when asked about<BR>politics. He turns to his Chinese assistant, who is typing furiously at<BR>her word processor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monica, do you have to go to political meetings?&quot; She looks blank.<BR>&quot;What?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political meetings,&quot; Brown repeats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh.&quot; She laughs. &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does anybody?&quot; Brown persists. Monica laughs again and shakes her<BR>head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown is asked if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has any Communist Party members on its staff?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; he says promptly. &quot;I know that for sure. The last one emigrated<BR>to the States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Bo Jackson's professional sports career is in limbo, Bo&nbsp;knows he can always hawk sneakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., provider of one of Jackson's many&nbsp;paychecks, says her company &quot;has never cancelled a contract with any&nbsp;professional athlete due to injury or illness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Dolan added that there is nothing in Jackson's contract with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stipulating he has to play two sports, or even one.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last spring, Jackson, whose football and baseball careers are&nbsp;jeopardized by a hip injury, signed an extension with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to cut him,'' said Dolan, commenting from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;Our fitness center is named after Bo. So&nbsp;we'd like to invite Bo to come spend the next year rehabilitating himself&nbsp;at the Bo Jackson Sports and Fitness Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't dump Michael Jordan when he had an injury that sidelined&nbsp;him in the second year of his contract. Dolan suggested Jackson's career&nbsp;may not be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo is a surprising, explosive athlete. I wouldn't jump to any&nbsp;conclusions,&quot; Dolan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forbes magazine recently reported Jackson's annual endorsement&nbsp;income at $ 2.5 million. His agent, Richard Woods, calls the figure&nbsp;conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, the ultimate football/baseball hybrid, can be seen in ad&nbsp;campaigns for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, AT&amp;T, Cheerios and Pepsi. He also serves as spokesman&nbsp;for Bo-Med - medical supplies for weekend warriors, of which he is part&nbsp;of a joint venture - and he's pursuing the possibility of starting a&nbsp;restaurant franchise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Jackson is restricted to playing only one sport, or none at&nbsp;all, it certainly diminishes his superman aura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two-sport thing has been the cornerstone of our campaign,&quot; Fred&nbsp;Schreyer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> director of sports marketing, said recently. &quot;I have no&nbsp;doubt he would be a star if he played one sport, and he might be a&nbsp;celebrity as well, but I don't think we ever would have gone the way we&nbsp;have if it wasn't the two-sport thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the guy who can do anything. That really stems from the fact&nbsp;he's kind of doing things nobody else has done.&quot;; Bo Jackson's career stats; BASEBALL</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here was Michael Jordan, already America's most popular athlete, on his knees in the Chicago Bulls' locker room moments after they won the National Basketball Association championship.  He was crying. He was praying. He was so demonstratively happy that millions of viewers shared his joy. As an athlete - and as one of this country's most carefully marketed commodities - Michael Jordan rose to an even higher pedestal.  ''He transcends the sport of basketball. It's hard to conceive of him being more popular than he already was, but that's what has happened,'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.  spokeswoman Melinda Gable said.  ''He transcends sports. He transcends all traditional boundaries of athletics,'' said Jordan's personal attorney, David Falk of the Arlington, Va., based ProServ agency.  ''He transcends almost every kind of category you could put him in,'' said Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing Report. ''He is one of the few players who has built respect and admiration worldwide.'' You get the picture.  Since coming into the NBA in 1984 after winning a National Collegiate Athletic Association title at North Carolina and the Olympic gold with Team USA, Jordan has moved into his own stratosphere as a player and as a business entity.  He has built the largest ''Q Rating'' among all sports figures; that influential rating grades the public acceptance level earned by celebrities in all walks of life.  Last year, Forbes magazine listed Jordan as the eighth-highest earner among athletes, with $8.5 million in 1990 income - about $6 million of that earned off the court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this summer, Sports Marketing Newsletter announced that Jordan had surpassed Arnold Palmer as America's top sports spokesman with $11 million in fees. ''There could be $15 million to $17 million there for him this year if he wants to milk it,'' said Brian Murphy, editor and publisher of the newsletter.  But Falk dismisses all those figures as much too low.  ''I saw that figure where he had just passed Palmer with $11 million,'' he said. ''That's not even close. He has single deals worth more than that.  ''We expected he'd be able to do some things, perhaps take it to a little different level when he came out of college. Nobody had any idea it would become this big. We didn't think it would. Michael's pare nts didn't think it would. (North Carolina coach Dean Smith didn't think it would. Even Michael probably didn't think it would.'' Murphy said Jordan took advantage of an opportunity waiting to happen.  ''There has been a precedent for this in the past,'' Murphy said. ''A similar fuss was made for Red Grange or Babe Ruth in their eras. There are so many more channels for the image to be distributed now.  ''The whole thing was in place for him to make it happen - or somebody like him. Retailers, merchandisers realize the power of the sports connection.  There are so many more opportunities to be capitalized upon.'' Friedman said: ''Slap his name and his picture on something and it's amazing what that will give a company for his 8 percent or 10 percent cut.'' Though Jordan's popularity has never been greater, Falk said they aren't trying to cash in this summer. They are conducting business as usual.  ''The core of Michael's marketing program has been in place for five or six years,'' Falk said. ''There have been very few new companies we've associated with the last five years. We're not looking to add more companies for which he'll endorse contracts.  ''He has a limited amount of time. He wants to enjoy his family and the offseason. We don't want to bog him down with TV shoots or print shoots.  That's not to say that something won't come along that might interest him.'' So what makes Michael special? Yes, he has won NBA scoring titles, MVP awards, defensive player-of-the-year citations and now a league title. More important, it seems, is his style. In a fast-paced sport in which grace battles brawn, Jordan has been its most creative and productive force since arriving as a rookie.  In a league full of acrobats, Jordan has remained a step ahead.  ''Michael comes back each year and adds a whole new wrinkle,'' Falk said.  ''He became the NBA's defensive player of the year. They said a question mark was his outside shooting and he became a legitimate 3-point shooter.'' And when the skeptics were questioning if Jordan could win it all, he did.  Yet there is far more to Jordan's success. He projects an affable earnestness through his public appearances, media relations and commercial work.  ''You couldn't manufacture a better image than Michael Jordan,'' Friedman said. ''He has gotten a lot of good advice from the people at ProServ.'' But, Falk said, ''Michael is his own man. He has good judgment. We provide an additional layer of judgment.'' To sell their products, companies such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - which is estimated to have sold 20 million pairs of Air Jordan sneakers in its six-year association with him - have built Jordan's image for their own gain. The cumulative effect of those commercials has made Jordan even more attractive as a pitchman.  Look for Jordan's newest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad on the telecast of baseball's All-Star Game.  ''Jordan wouldn't be a star unless he could do those amazing things on the court,'' Murphy said. ''But the advertising is what established him as something special. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads made him known to everybody, even those people who didn't know anything about basketball.'' America has gotten to know Jordan through his ads.  ''He is one of the few people who has a lot of deals going who doesn't look like he's overexposed, over saturated, or too greedy,'' Friedman said.  ''He's fortunate. The advertisements he's been involved with have been so well executed. The Coke spots are very endearing. So are the McDonald's ads.  Those are wonderful advertisements.'' Jordan's salesmanship has earned him criticism as well as adulation. His Air Jordan shoe became so popular that impoverished youngsters in crime-infested cities have resorted to violence to get them.  ''When you reach a higher level or success, there is a strong tendency for people to criticize aspects of what you do,'' Falk said. ''People will say these shoes are responsible for kids killing each other.'' So Jordan and filmmaker Spike Lee have been blasted for exploiting and endangering black youths with their highly successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign.  Opponents of the Illinois lottery have also taken Jordan to task for advertising a damaging message.  ''I wish Michael would re-evaluate his priorities,'' the Rev. Thomas O'Gorman of Chicago's St. Malachy Catholic Church told the Chicago Tribune.  ''He's not a bad person, but I would sure like to see him on TV talking about the need to support impoverished people victimized by the lottery.'' Falk equated such criticism to blaming Jordan's Chevrolet ads for auto pollution or his McDonald's ads for the dangers of preservatives.  ''If you listen to all those arguments, you couldn't endorse anything,'' he said.  Experts wonder if any athlete will be able to rival Jordan's popularity in the 1990s.  ''There is one athlete, potentially, who could approach him,'' Murphy said.  ''It's a long shot, but what if the Chicago White Sox go to the World Series and the Los Angeles Raiders go to the Super Bowl? How big would Bo Jackson be? ''In the here an d now, though, nobody holds a candle to Jordan.'' Despite Jackson's cross-training gimmick and similarly clever advertising campaigns, he can't touch Jordan's commercial revenue.  ''No one can even come close to Michael Jordan,'' ProServ's Louis Cunningham said. ''That's not a slight on Bo, Magic (Johnson or (Larry Bird.  It's just a common fact.'' Jackson may be the only baseball player who can project a charismatic, Jordan-like image. To reach that level, Murphy said, any other ballplayer would have to ''overcome that unfortunate public perception of baseball players as greedy and whining. I don't see it happening. I think when Jordan's days are done, it may be another basketball player who takes over.'' There is a chance, though, that Jordan will remain in the spotlight long after his basketball career. He dreams of playing in the PGA Tour.  ''If he goes out and becomes a success as a golfer, a mainstay on the pro tour, he could last for about 10 or 15 years,'' Murphy said. ''He would be perceived as a wonderman. It's something to think about.  ''I'm sure his agent is encouraging him to work on his short game.'' HEIR JORDAN Here are a few highlights of Michael Jordan's off-court enterprise: Industry experts estimate that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sold up to 20 million Air Jordan sneakers in the firm's six-year association with Jordan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.  spokeswoman Melinda Gable said sales figures are confidential but did say that annual sales of Jordan's single shoe model would make the Air Jordan America's third-largest sneaker company - behind only the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brands and Reebok.  McDonald's created a short-term promotional burger - the McJordan - which it used in the Chicago region until the McLean was introduced earlier this year.  ''Anybody popular enough to have McDonald's name a sandwich after them is very popular,'' said Scott Hume, the Chicago bureau chief for Advertising Age.  ''McDonald's doesn't mess with their menu for just anybody.'' According to state records cited by the Chicago Tribune, the Illinois lottery paid Jordan $900,000 for seven hours' work on two days nearly a year apart. He appeared in television and print advertising.  ''In my estimation he's a superstar,'' lottery director Sharon Sharp told the newspaper. ''What he stands for has been tremendous for us.'' Jordan has enjoyed longtime relationships with Chevrolet, Coca-Cola and Wheaties. He also produces highlight videos with CBS and Fox; has his own line of men's wear; and has signed numerous merchandising contracts for all sorts of products, including Hang-Time Gum.  - Jeff Gordon</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For advertisers, 1990 was a strange year. Early on, the outlook was rosy. Ads glowed with glasnost to celebrate historic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But by fall, ads addressed more somber topics - a souring economy and the Persian Gulf crisis. USA TODAY's Stuart Elliott looks back in this review of best and worst ads of 1990:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hits again: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just might be the most creative advertiser of 1990. The best of the best was ''Bo's family reunion.'' Few thought </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could top its ''Bo knows'' spots, among the best ads of 1989. But this wildly imaginative TV ad presented 15 versions of superstar Bo Jackson, excelling in every sport from football and baseball to horse racing and golf.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other highlights:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- ''Announcers,'' a TV ad that parodies football, sportscasters and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Two more TV ads in the Mars Blackmon series directed by Spike Lee and co-starring Lee and basketball titan Michael Jordan. They drew more praise than Lee got for his movie Mo' Better Blues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A new campaign called ''Rock 'n' roll tennis.'' One TV ad paired Andre Agassi and the year's most unlikely pitchstars - the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a cult punk-rock band.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every ad clicked. Someday, Mr. Rogers is going to spank </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the ''Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood'' ads with David Robinson. Can you say, ''Cease and desist''? Agency: Wieden &amp; Kennedy Inc.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the pink: Year 2 of Energizer's series of E.B. ads surpassed the fun of Year 1, when Energizer also made the Best Ads list. Just when viewers least expected it, along came the pink rabbit to march through ads that mock other ads. Targets in '90: ads for air fresheners, long-distance telephone service, soft drinks and hemorrhoid remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most hilarious: an ad that simultaneously made fun of foreign films and coming attractions. It took the form of a preview for a make-believe movie called Dance with Your Feet. To complete the illusion, the ad ran in movie theaters as well as on TV. Agency: Chiat/Day/<BR>Mojo Inc.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Politically speaking: For everyone who despairs over mud-slinging political ads, hope surfaced in Minnesota's U.S. Senate race. Deftly humorous TV ads for long-shot challenger Paul Wellstone were a big reason that he upset the two-term Republican incumbent, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ad, ''Looking for Rudy,'' was based on the comic documentary Roger &amp; Me. The ad followed Wellstone as he searched in vain for Boschwitz so they could debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ad, ''Fast-paced Paul,'' presented Wellstone cramming all his positions into a single 30-second spot. The rapid spiel was necessary, the ad explained, because Wellstone couldn't match Boschwitz's ad budget. Agency: North Woods Advertising, adman Bill Hillsman's free-lance shop.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Doggone clever: A TV ad for Milk-Bone dog treats put smiles on the faces of viewers by putting a smile on the face of a dog. The ad likened new Milk- Bone tartar-control products to toothpaste. The inspired video image that closed the sale: a bull mastiff sporting an enormous ear-to-ear grin. The silly sight was made possible by special effects that superimposed a human mouth onto the dog's mouth. Agency: FCB/Leber Katz Partners.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> These ads fly: The growing glut of car ads in '90 made it hard for any pitch to stand out. Kudos to Chrysler's Eagle line for ads that manage to stand out and be outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads all are in the same style: As an announcer asks a car buyer why he or she purchased a 1991 Eagle model, there's a wry twist to a familiar joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sample: A man says Eagle Talon ''rated higher in overall quality of workmanship than cars like Ford Probe and Honda CRX.'' Says the announcer, actor Orson Bean: ''I'd like to see a breakdown of all the competition.'' The man replies, ''Now, let's not get spiteful.'' Agency: Campbell-Mithun-Esty Advertising.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Comebacks: A hot trend that began in '88 - revival ads - reached fever pitch. To get the attention of baby-boom consumers, advertisers brought back familiar characters, slogans and jingles of the '50s, '60s and '70s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A warm Welcome Back to: Punchy, Hawaiian Punch's punch-drinking cartoon kid; Coca-Cola Classic's reunited hilltop choir; Nipper the RCA dog, joined by a junior puppy partner; a cartoon baby named Horton whose first words are ''Ruffles have r-r-r-r-idges''; and Joe DiMaggio back at bat for Mr. Coffee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After seven years, Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to their first NBA championship - and no one is happier than Mars Blackmon, the basketball-crazy fan of Spike Lee's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> latest humorous, celebrity-packed pitch, which debuts tonight during baseball's All-Star Game, has Mars at the NBA finals at Chicago Stadium, asking his perennial question, ''Is it the shoes?'' In the ad's kicker, A.C. Green of the defeated Los Angeles Lakers, grimly concedes, ''It had to be the shoes.'' Another version shows actress Dyan Cannon, one of the Lakers' famous fans, woefully agreeing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bought four minutes of ad time during the All-Star game to kick off a $ 35 million ''Air'' campaign that features its biggest stars: basketball stars Jordan, David Robinson and Charles Barkley, tennis star Andre Agassi, and multi-sport star Bo Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The athletes all have appeared in their own series of ads, but ''We wanted to have a link,'' says Tom Clark, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marketing director. ''It's not a real heavy-handed link. ... It says, these are the best shoes by the best athletes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series, by agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy, includes the return of Bo Jackson in his first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad since the hip injury that put his athletic career on hold and, as a result, raised questions about his endorsement career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everybody knows what Bo's status is,'' Clark says. ''You could do an ad not addressing it, but by addressing it you connect more with the sports fan, who wants to know what's going on with Bo.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Air series ads, like the Jordan spots, provide a one-two celebrity punch. In an ad to run during the U.S. Open, a TV screen shows Agassi hitting the ball with such force that the TV rockets across the room. One vicious swat jars the TV's channel to a flash of Julia Child's cooking show, with the chef holding up an artichoke. Bo's ad ends with boxer George Forman jumping into the production number - and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises more surprise endings to come.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channel 4's documentary, Trainer Wars, is about designer sports shoes, those things which are worn as far as possible from your brain. At the peak of their popularity, I succumbed to buying a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, rather in the spirit in which I succumbed to buying Time's Arrow and the last Prince album: not so much because I liked these things for themselves, more because I liked the image of me having them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This idea of myself, as imparted by my pristine possessions, as a bit of a hip Londoner, a bit of a Notting Hillbilly, a bit of a Hanif Kureishi character, someone who knew ''what was going down'' and who has pressed the ''pause'' button on their individual growth at the age of 25, did give me the temporary pleasure of feeling myself a part of contemporary culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time's Arrow and the Prince album were, indeed, all right. However, one day soon after purchase, I was walking along in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, feeling athletic and airy and cool and young and a bit like Linford Christie, when, in a street window, I caught a glimpse of a bag-lady with the squat, capable legs of an American footballer and the bouncy, strutting walk of a Harlem pimp. Since then I have not worn the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Instead, I am keeping them as heirlooms: in a hundred years' time they may be worth almost as much as I paid for them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sight of those great Olive Oyl feet exposed to me the idiocy of wanting to assemble one's persona from a media kit, although that does not mean that I should not succumb again were my Hip Londonr gland to be over-stimulated.  And, as I was reminded by Trainer Wars, the advertising of these absurd shoes has been magnificent. It has united youth culture's Holy Trinity of music, clothes and sport and made an unprecedentedly powerful god.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since the acquisition of their own identity in the 1950s, young people have been shadowed by clever salesmen: Colonel Tom Parker, Andrew Oldham, Malcolm McLaren, the boys at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok, all of them exploiting the desire of the young to proclaim the belief that their youth is different from anybody else's. The music, the clothes are theirs and theirs alone: banners of individuality listened to and worn by each identical young generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok are, however, unprecedentedly powerful because they have brought the factor of sport into the clothes plus music equation. Sport, as we know, is taking over the world. My advice to John, Neil and Paddy is that whichever political party can enlist the support of most sportsmen will win the next election. Trainer Wars hints at sinister undertones to the designer sport shoes boys' imagistic stranglehold on youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brand names compete to sponsor basketball camps in America, in order that all players should wear their shoes and that any emergent star should be in grateful thrall to the company. The basketball player, Michael Jordan, endorses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan, which does $200million-worth of business a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I cannot see anything too terrible about that. What Trainer Wars implies beyond this is the insidious effect of such powerful marketing, particuarly upon black youth, the group of people at whom the product is principally aimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trainers are typically advertised via a black and white film with a soundtrack of incomprehensible streetwise shouting over a rhythmic banging together o dustbin lids, plus shots of young black men in baseball caps and voluminous trousers boucing down mean streets on their Zebedee-sprung shoes and looking, beyond their faint risibility, threatening and dispossessed.  There is then a coda in which a black sportsman informs the camera that these shoes give you Attitude. Music plus clothes plus sport: it equals big bucks, but does it also equal, as Trainer Wars implies, big trouble?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When boys are being murdered for their trainers, as they are in America, then that is big trouble, and the documentary links the violence to the imagistic stranglehold upon today's youth by the sports shoes companies. The programme describes a dangerously heady cocktail, constantly being mixed by irresponsible bartenders, comprising the aggressiveness of rap music, the exhibitionism of fashion, the competitiveness of sport and the mindlessescapism of all three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It portrays, in effect, the misdemeanours of youth as a contemporary phenomenon rather than as an eternal constant, and it looks to lay the blame upon the makers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rather than the makers of societies. Trainer Wars is an interesting documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to make sports shoes the focal point of a serious television programme is to perpetrate the power of the image that you are affecting to criticise: an unconscious stupidity, typical of an Anglo-American culture which sometimes seems as inescapably designer as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Michael Della Ratta's pursuit of stress relief eventually brought him to Tokyo.  While working at a consulting firm in Washington D.C. 11 years ago, he enrolled at a local Japanese martial arts school, to help work off every day stress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hooked by aikido, he came to Japan to study the martial art for a year in Wakayama Prefecture, near Osaka.  Dela Ratta said he was particularly impressed by aikido's great attention to form, or kata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The characteristics of aikido may apply to Japanese business in general, he said.  &quot;The Japanese don't spent a lot of time analyzing.  Instead, they concentrate more on forming internal modes of operation, so they can react to many different situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since joining </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1982, he has spent most of the last decade in Asia, including stints of China and Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As general manager of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan Corp.'s corporate planning office since September, Della Ratta calls himself a &quot;cultural bridge&quot; between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. of the U.S. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissho Iwai Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I try to do is get </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan on the same timetable as the rest of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which is very tough,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Della Ratta sees the changing lifestyles of Japan as beneficial to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  &quot;Now Japanese people want to get outdoors more.  They want to be running, mountain biking or surfing.  So that's encouraging for our industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS every red-blooded American knows, some of the most memorable design imagery over the past decade has been lavished not on buildings, but on athletic shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , the sports and fitness company that has brought forth Air Jordans and &quot;Just Do It,&quot; has created </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, a 12,000-square-foot store in downtown Portland, Ore. The new store, which will soon be replicated elsewhere, may do for fitness merchandising what the Ralph Lauren stores did for home design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town is modeled after a town square surrounded by freestanding pavilions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the movie 'Back to the Future'?&quot; asked Gordon Thompson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> creative director. &quot;We thought the town square would be a great idea for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town.&quot; If it smacks of Disney's Main Street, that too, is part of the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've tried to combine the merchandising concepts of Ralph Lauren, the fun of Disneyland, the exhibitry of the Smithsonian and the atmosphere of F.A.O Schwarz,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The store, which opened in late November, uses video screens as major design elements. Like the Lauren stores, it is a total environment. In the Aqua Gear pavilion, where waterproof gear is sold, shoes and socks are mounted in front of an aquarium. Product colors are coordinated with those of the fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers try on socks around a &quot;video pond,&quot; above, composed of nine floor monitors, which substitutes video images of sharks and other creatures for water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such achingly hip design, which includes an Air Jordan penthouse, signals a new approach to marketing by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which plans to open a similar store in New York next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People want to be entertained while shopping,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;This is like a movie for people to go and see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., L.A. Gear Inc. denied today that its new Catapult shoe infringed two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear said technology used in the Catapult did not infringe a cushioning system patent held by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company said the United States Patent Office had previously not objected to L.A. Gear's use of technology that might appear similar to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L.A. Gear also said its shoe's lacing system did not infringe another patent held by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company said it would defend itself against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear said separately that it had filed for a deadline extension to March 15 from March 1 on the recording of some financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the company has posted losses, L.A. Gear said it was out of compliance with covenants on a $360 million bank line of credit and needed to evaluate the results of continuing negotiations. The company said it expected to conclude talks with lenders and might announce a new agreement by March 15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear Inc. filed a $3 billion lawsuit today against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., charging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with trying to monopolize the market for high-tech sneakers and drive L.A.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wieden &amp; Kennedy Inc., the Portland, Ore., agency that coined the anthemic phrase &quot;just do it&quot; for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., has taken its own advice. It has produced one of the year's most admired campaigns -- again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the high-water mark in American advertising,&quot; said Andy Berlin, a principal at Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saluting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign's &quot;style and 'cool' factor,&quot; Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, added that Wieden's advertising &quot;isn't just to shock or get attention; it sells the product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among this year's lauded ads for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a nostalgic, low-key television commercial shown during Super Bowl XXV; print ads that talked to, not at, women, in a sensitive, respectful manner, and a series of humorous &quot;Bo Show&quot; spots, which defied predictions that Bo Jackson's football injury would end his effectiveness as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorser.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Pepsi Gets a Prize Slogan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does Diet Pepsi have the right one, baby? Indubitably. (You were expecting &quot;Uh-huh&quot;?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slickly produced campaign for the Pepsi-Cola soft drink, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, has spawned an upbeat national catch phrase during a less-than-upbeat year. The campaign's slogan -- &quot;You got the right one baby, uh-huh,&quot; half-sung, half-growled by Ray Charles -- has been added to the vernacular, and has been placed on Diet Pepsi containers. The advertising was &quot;a step ahead,&quot; said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign marked another victory in its psychological warfare with Coca-Cola. Coke outsells Pepsi. But Pepsi often out-advertises and out-markets Coke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Coca-Cola, I haven't noticed any spots all year,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York. &quot;Yet I've noticed all the Pepsi spots.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Nuprin's Luck With Endorser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finding an outstanding campaign in the pill-and-pain category is like fishing a diamond ring out of a box of Cracker Jack. Yet J. Walter Thompson USA in New York managed that feat with advertising for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Nuprin brand of ibuprofen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nupe it with Nuprin,&quot; the campaign urged, and consumers heeded that call to self-medicate, as sales of the brand, previously sluggish, began to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign won praise for another rarity, signing a spokesman from the sports world who was actually well suited for the product. Of course, it was sweet serendipity that the endorser, the aging tennis star Jimmy Connors, unexpectedly stormed his way into the U.S. Open semifinals just as the campaign started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One complaint: the unfortunate play on words between &quot;Nupe&quot; and &quot;Nuke.&quot; Some say the campaign works despite that; others say that is exactly what makes the ads work.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Auto Themes: Safe and Frugal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two unorthodox automotive campaigns drew raves, though the plaudits were far from unanimous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Volvo Cars of North America, Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer in New York played single-mindedly on motorists' anxieties about safety, using the theme &quot;Drive Safely.&quot; It is &quot;the best tagline,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;Very simple and very appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some executives were put off by the suggestion that parents who love their children drive only Volvos. Some also saw the campaign's attack on mini-vans as an unfair swipe at Chrysler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other campaign was for Subaru of America's 1992 models, by Wieden &amp; Kennedy. A refreshing dose of reality infused the campaign, which debunked traditional auto-advertising obsessions with status, power and glamour. One spot, startling in its candor, depicted people who pay a lot for trophy cars as shallow, vain and deep in debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign theme, &quot;what to drive,&quot; came under fire. &quot;It takes itself so seriously in trying to be different,&quot; said Marty Weiss, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Challenge of the 90's: Credit Cards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The red-hot debate raging over the new American Express green card campaign has ad folks arguing until they are blue in the face. For now, color the prevailing judgments dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York, belittled the advertising's &quot;spend, spend, spend, isn't-life-fun, yuppie attitude.&quot; He and others cited ads by Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. in New York that celebrate frivolities like flying the Concorde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The creative strikes me as sophomoric,&quot; said Jay Schulberg, executive vice president and executive creative head of Bozell Inc. in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel J. Chisholm, president of the Mingo Group Inc. in New York, is &quot;not sure this approach is direct enough -- and I carry two American Express cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, less negative, argue that the campaign will evolve. They say it would do better to focus on a theme found in some of the ads, which present the card as a powerful financial tool with flexible spending limits and no revolving-interest charges.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Not Much Memorable From Detroit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was not a good year for Detroit. Nor was it a good year for Detroit's advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's no wonder G.M. is closing 21 plants, with the kind of advertising they do,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most castigated campaigns: the muddled, meaningless theme for Oldsmobile, &quot;the power of intelligent engineering,&quot; by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, and the nearly invisible advertising for Chrysler's struggling Plymouth division, by Bozell Inc. in Birmingham, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A notable exception was the advertising by Hal Riney &amp; Partners in San Francisco for General Motors' Saturn division, which was warmly applauded for its intelligent appeals to car buyers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>'News' Approach Raises Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of television commercials by McCann-Erickson in New York for the Vaseline line of skin-care lotions was cited by some as a dubious achievement in deceit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spots featured Joan Lunden, the co-host of ABC's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; in what seemed to be news reports on skin care. The spots used elements of news shows, like an anchor desk and on-screen logos, which cloaked their commercial nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're trying to build credibility for a product, you don't do it by creating a fake news show,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;You're trying to trick me, and I don't like being tricked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pitfalls of such spots were underscored on Dec. 19, when one turned up during ABC's news magazine &quot;Prime Time Live.&quot; The network, which had barred the spots from running during news programs, apologized for the error.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Testing the Limits on Bare Flesh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The notorious, nude-filled advertising supplement for Calvin Klein jeans drew lots of gawkers. Most agreed that the emperor, too, wore no clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplement, created by Mr. Klein's in-house advertising department, was included in a plastic bag wrapped around selected copies of the October issue of Vanity Fair magazine -- a &quot;polybagged outsert&quot; in the industry's picturesque jargon. Inside, 116 pages of black-and-white photographs depicted pouty young men, pretending to be members of a rock band, preening in various states of undress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It symbolized advertising's never-ending efforts to test the limits in using sex, and skin, to sell products.  But people on both sides of that issue thought the campaign was artless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It stood for everything that missed the mark,&quot; said Donny Deutsch, creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York. He decried the advertising's supplement's &quot;decadent sexuality&quot; as &quot;so 80's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, termed it &quot;out of touch.&quot; His special peeve: &quot;They didn't show the models how to hold the guitars right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Van Kampen confirmed Friday that his new firm, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities, is negotiating with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates Inc. to buy its packaged products division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that while the deal has not yet been finalized, he expected the matter to be resolved by Oct. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been in discussions working with them and trying to come to an agreement,&quot; Mr. Van Kampen stated. &quot;I believe we are moving to a resolution, but it's not a deal yet.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown, the firm's chairman, could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton Brown has sold about $6.5 billion of unit investment trusts since 1974, and employs 40 to 45 people in its packaged products division, according to the firm's marketing department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton Brown was once a part of a firm - Van Kampen Wauterlek &amp; Co. - that Mr. Van Kampen started in 1967. Seven years later the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said he was &quot;very saddened&quot; that the confidentiality of the negotiations was &quot;breached&quot; when Clayton Brown sent an internal memo to its packaged product employees saying they would continue to be employed either at Clayton Brown or at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen started </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in May, less than a month after Van Kampen Merritt Inc., the firm he formed in 1974 and sold to Xerox Financial Services in 1984, announced it was dropping its investment banking business to concentrate on its asset management business that includes mutual funds and unit investment trusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One municipal finance source said, &quot;He's coming back in a big way to compete with Van Kampen Merritt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Van Kampen Merritt did not return phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of April, the firm had sold $19 billion of unit investment trusts and was the largest U.S. sponsor of insured tax-free unit trust investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said that all &quot;non-compete&quot; agreements that he made with Xerox at the time he sold the firm had since expired. He explained that the idea to acquire Clayton Brown's unit trust business occurred when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acquired &quot;a key&quot; packaged product employee from Clayton Brown who &quot;felt there would be a possibility Clayton Brown would be interested in selling the whole department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which is operating out of temporary quarters in West Chicago, Ill., employs 20 people - including some former Van Kampen Merritt employees - involved in the trading, underwriting and sale of tax-exempt and taxable bonds to institutional investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of its packaged products division would not have a great effect on Clayton Brown's business, according to one public finance official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They haven't been among the majors in that area,&quot; the source said. &quot;They've been focusing on public finance, doing a lot of work as a co manager.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Earlier yesterday, Oregon-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported first-quarter net income of US$114 million (C$130 million), or US$1.50 a share, on revenues of US$947 million, compared to 1990 first-quarter income of US$99.7 million, or US$2.62 a share, on revenues of US$833.6 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said first-quarter results benefited from a big increase in ''at-once'' sales. Those sales - not booked as future orders - rose 45% in the quarter ended Aug. 31. In a telephone conference call with analysts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials said it is unlikely ''at-once'' sales will reach that level in the second quarter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the first quarter's record revenues and earnings reflect growth in all its brand divisions and other brands. Domestic footwear revenues increased 5% to US$558.3 million, while domestic athletic apparel grew 24% to US$98.6 million over last year. International sales rose 37% to US$248.3 million over last year, while revenues from other brands, such as Cole Haan and Tetra Plastics, rose 8% to US$42 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least not this season for the Kansas City Royals.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo Jackson, the two-sport superstar who has evolved through a series of endorsements into one of the nation's best-known athletes, was released Monday by the Royals amid speculation his careers are in jeopardy due to a hip injury.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is suffering from a fracture-dislocation of his left hip which has resulted in cartilage damage in the hip socket. The injury prompted Royals team physician Dr. Steve Joyce to recommend Jackson not play baseball this season. Jackson, however, said Monday he still plans to play this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury occurred Jan. 13 when Jackson was playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in an NFL playoff game against Cincinnati. Joyce examined Jackson in February, at which time Jackson asked Joyce to not tell Royals' management about the injury.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination came before Jackson agreed to a $ 2.375-million contract with the team.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has become one of sports most recognizable figures through his unprecedented on-field accomplishments as an outfielder with the Royals and running back with the Raiders, as well as a multitude of commercials.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous is his &quot;Bo Knows&quot; campaign for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.  athletic footwear company. He has also appeared in ads for AT&amp;T, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew and about a dozen other products.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royals felt Jackson would not be able to play this season. By releasing Jackson before Opening Day, the team will be responsible for only one-sixth ($ 395,833) of Jackson's contract.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Royals general manager Herk Robinson said at the team's training facility near Haines City.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We got nearly $ 2.5-million involved in a situation like this; finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson, speaking prior to the Royals' announcement, said he did not expect to miss all of the baseball season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't count me out,&quot; he said at a press conference earlier Monday in Birmingham, Ala., where he was examined by Dr. James Andrews. &quot;I know deep down I'll be back playing baseball this year.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson was not available for comment Monday night.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce said he had not told Jackson his careers are over.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The prognosis is uncertain,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;If some cartilage re-forms, the prognosis may be good. It's too early to give a final call on that. . . . My concern was that if he attempted to return this season too early, further damage could occur.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has been on crutches and undergoing therapy since the injury. Other doctors who examined Jackson had conflicting opinions on whether Jackson could play baseball this season and gave different time frames for a return.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> &quot;He's a great athlete. He'll get well,&quot; said Raiders managing general partner Al Davis, in Hawaii for the NFL owners meeting. &quot;We've had players with injuries like this before and they played. There are players in this league who have it. We're going to stick by him. He'll come back strong and he'll play both sports. We want him to play both.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has completed four seasons of a five-year, $ 7.4-million football contract which allows him to join the team at mid-season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Joyce's report, special X-ray studies &quot;confirmed the loss of joint cartilage space and the development of early avascular necrosis&quot; in the hip.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease, in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, is not usually caused by a single injury, and is more commonly associated with older people.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrews would not comment on the diagnosis of avascular necrosis, saying only Jackson had suffered a significant injury and that blood flow to the hip joint is being monitored.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jackson can't play one or both sports, it could effect his endorsements bonanza.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson was found to be the most persuasive athlete in television commercials according to a 1989 survey by Video Storyboard Test, a New York advertising research firm.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconfirmed reports place Jackson's income from endorsements at between $ 2-million and $ 4-million a year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which has credited Jackson's TV commercials with boosting its footwear sales from 80-million pairs in 1987 to 280-million in 1990, has no plans to end its association with Jackson.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't expect this to have any effect over the long-term,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman Liz Dolan said from the company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters. &quot;Unfortunately, injuries are a part of sports. It's not likely </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would abandon Bo Jackson.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson last year signed a new contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through 1993.  He does about three TV commercials a year, advises </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials on shoe design and occasionally makes appearances for the company, Dolan said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is not in his contract that he is required to play two sports,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;If he were to retire from sports, that would affect the relationship. But until Bo tells us otherwise, we expect him to play baseball next year.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injuries are not new to Jackson. He missed several key games while playing college football at Auburn, has been on the disabled list in each of the past three baseball seasons, and has had occasional injuries with the Raiders.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the number one draft pick of the Tampa Bay Bucs in 1986, but spurned them to play baseball for Kansas City. He later signed to play football with the Raiders.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royals will officially place Jackson on waivers this morning.  Other teams can claim him for $ 1 during a 72-hour period, but would be responsible for his 1991 salary. If he clears waivers, he would be free to sign with any team.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawyer with the baseball players union said he did not think the Royals could properly release Jackson &quot;without substantial financial responsibility.&quot; A club cannot release a player if he is injured as the result of a baseball event. The Royals feel this is a football injury.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's tragic that this happened,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;Bo played a vital and exciting role in the development of sports in this country.&quot;<BR> Information from staff writer Gary Shelton, the Associated Press, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times was used in compiling this report.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Jordan, a 28-year-old basketball player with the Chicago Bulls, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he does things that make you gasp.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player ever to grace the court. Columnist George Will has suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-denomination dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, Jordan has had to play in a Bulls team that collapsed when the going got tough and in the National Basketball Association's play-offs, thegoing gets very tough indeed.  This year, however, the Bulls are playing the Los Angeles Lakers for the championship.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is dominated by blacks. Since to play professional basketball at all you need great discipline, and to play it at Jordan's level you need extraordinary flair and imagination, it is hardly surprising that the great search for &quot;role models&quot; for black children should have fastened on the Bulls' star. Since Jordan is intelligent and articulate, notable for good sportsmanship and devoted to charitable work (though without ever seeming cloyingly goody-goody about it), he is an obvious choice.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a catch two catches, actually. The first is Jordan's association with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America's leading maker of sneakers. Jordan has been endorsing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products since 1984: the Air Jordan shoe is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> best-selling line. He is not alone; other black heroes like filmmaker Spike Lee and John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown University, also endorse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with that? According to Jesse Jackson, black America's most popular politician and a basketball fan, a lot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he argues, is promoting an &quot;ethos of mindless materialism&quot; by encouraging black children to buy sneakers (the latest Air Jordan costs $ 125) that they cannot afford. That sounds like killjoyism taken to the limit, but Jackson has a point.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if inner-city children buy just one pair of sneakers; the pressure from the street is to keep up with the latest fashions. Some youngsters own as many as 50 pairs of sneakers; one 14-year-old boy told the Washington Post he spent $ 2,000 a year on shoes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not need to be a genius to work out one of the most likely ways in which some inner-city youngsters come by such sums: It is by selling drugs. Some drug dealers use sneakers as a way of recruiting youngsters to their gangs; some gangs identify themselves by the sneakers they wear, or accept stolen sneakers as payment for drugs. There have even been incidents where people<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>R have been murdered for their high-fashion basketball shoes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be fair, makes sure that its role-model endorsers like Jordan appear in advertisements warning kids off drugs and encouraging them to stay in school. But Jackson is entitled to wonder whether those messages are as strong as the ones coming from the street.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger catch is in the very idea of role models. Behind the search for role models lies the assumption that only great people such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X or Jordan himself are worthy of emulation. When those idols are found to have feet of clay andeveryone who draws breath does the pain of disenchantment can be profound.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Jordan himself knows the pressure that role-modelling puts on him: &quot;I'm not a perfect person,&quot; he has said.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters News Agency<BR>  BEAVERTON, Ore.<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the largest U.S. marketer of athletic shoes, reported third-<BR>quarter earnings jumped 12 per cent but the performance has disappointed<BR>Wall Street this week and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock price tumbled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Beaverton-based sneaker maker - whose earnings were restrained by<BR>advertising and interest costs - earned $70.7-million (U.S.) in the<BR>quarter ended Feb. 28, or 93 cents a share, up from $63.1-million or 83<BR>cents a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, its stock tumbled $2.50 to<BR>finish at $47.50 in active trading after the earnings report. The shares<BR>fell another $1.75 on Tuesday and 50 cents yesterday, to close at $45.25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> share earnings were at the low end of Wall Street forecasts,<BR>which ranged from 90 cents to $1.05, according to a survey of 13 analysts<BR>by Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan Inc. The average forecast was 97 cents a share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its earnings report, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said revenue shot up 39 per cent in the<BR>third quarter to $802.2-million from $577.9-million a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the once high-flying sneaker maker L.A. Gear Inc. said it<BR>had reached agreement with its banks to restructure loan agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month the No. 3 maker of athletic shoes reported a $7.1-million<BR>loss for the fourth quarter, technically throwing L.A. Gear into default<BR>with the banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles-based L.A. Gear said its agreement with bank lenders, led<BR>by BankAmerica Corp. of San Francisco, waives the sneaker maker from a<BR>technical default it had anticipated. The company has said it expects a<BR>first-quarter loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said total bank credit will be cut, at its request, to<BR>$300-million from $360-million, with a limit of $250-million for<BR>borrowings and $70-million for letters of credit. The sublimit for letters<BR>of credit would fall to $50-million later in the year. The agreement is<BR>subject to final documentation, expected to be completed by the end of<BR>March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the king of canvas, Converse Inc. had been reduced to also-ran&nbsp;status in the sneaker market after the meteoric leap of No. 1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.&nbsp;and No. 2 Reebok International Ltd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reprinted from The Economist, a magazine published by Economist&nbsp;Newspaper Ltd. of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York, it was once said, has Jews, Italians and Irish, so New&nbsp;York is manic, brassy and exciting. Chicago has Poles, Croats and&nbsp;Slovaks, so Chicago is sullen, defeated and oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was before Eastern Europe won its freedom; and before&nbsp;Michael Jordan, too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan, 28, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the&nbsp;intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he&nbsp;does things that make you gasp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player&nbsp;ever to grace the court. George Will, a conservative columnist, has&nbsp;suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-&nbsp;denomination bank notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous years, Jordan has had to play on a Chicago Bulls team&nbsp;that collapsed when the going got tough - and in the National Basketball&nbsp;Association's playoffs, the going gets very tough indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, however, the Bulls have swept all before them. Last week&nbsp;they completed a four-game rout of the Detroit Pistons - champions the&nbsp;past two years - in the NBA semifinals. This week they will play for the&nbsp;championship. Winning a championship ring would be the culmination of&nbsp;Jordan's career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is&nbsp;dominated by blacks. Since to play professional basketball at all you&nbsp;need great discipline, and to play it at Jordan's level you need&nbsp;extraordinary flair and imagination, it is hardly surprising that the&nbsp;great search for &quot;role models&quot; for black children should have fastened on&nbsp;the Bulls' star. Since Jordan is intelligent and articulate, notable for&nbsp;good sportsmanship and devoted to charitable work (though without ever&nbsp;seeming cloyingly goody-goody about it), he is an obvious choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a catch - two catches, actually. The first is&nbsp;Jordan's association with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, America's leading maker of sneakers.&nbsp;Jordan has been endorsing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products since 1984: The Air Jordan shoe&nbsp;is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> best-selling line. He is not alone; other black heroes, like&nbsp;filmmaker Spike Lee and John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown&nbsp;University, also endorse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is wrong with that? According to Jesse Jackson, black America's&nbsp;most popular politician and a basketball fan, a lot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he argues, is&nbsp;promoting an &quot;ethos of mindless materialism&quot; by encouraging black&nbsp;children to buy sneakers (the latest Air Jordans cost $ 125) that they&nbsp;cannot afford. That sounds like killjoyism taken to the limit, but&nbsp;Jackson has a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not as if inner-city children buy just one pair of sneakers;&nbsp;the pressure from the street is to keep up with the latest fashions. Some&nbsp;youngsters own as many as 50 pairs of sneakers; one 14-year-old boy told&nbsp;The Washington Post that he spent $ 2,000 a year on shoes.; Sneakers used as lure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do not need to be a genius to work out one of the most likely&nbsp;ways in which some inner-city youngsters come by such sums: It is by&nbsp;selling drugs. Some drug dealers use sneakers as a way of recruiting&nbsp;youngsters to their gangs; some gangs identify themselves by the sneakers&nbsp;they wear, or accept stolen sneakers as payment for drugs. There have&nbsp;even been incidents in which people have been murdered for their high-&nbsp;fashion basketball shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to be fair, makes sure that its role-model endorsers like&nbsp;Jordan appear in advertisements warning kids off drugs and encouraging&nbsp;them to stay in school. But Jackson is entitled to wonder whether those&nbsp;messages are as strong as the ones coming from the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bigger catch is in the very idea of role models. Behind the&nbsp;search for role models lies the assumption that only great men such as&nbsp;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X or Jordan himself are worthy of&nbsp;emulation. When those idols are found to have feet of clay - and everyone&nbsp;who draws breath does - the pain of disenchantment can be profound.; Parents best role models</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan knows the pressure that role-modeling puts on him: &quot;I'm not a&nbsp;perfect person,&quot; he has said. He agrees with Charles Barkley, another NBA&nbsp;star, that the most useful role models for children are not heroes like&nbsp;himself but their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another drawback to role models. The majority of children&nbsp;have no chance of fame on the basketball court, or anywhere else. The&nbsp;veneration of sportsmen subtly denigrates more mundane but realistic&nbsp;goals - like getting a steady job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What blacks need is not supermen but economic opportunity; and, as&nbsp;two recent sets of studies by the Brookings Institution and the Urban&nbsp;Institute have shown (as if the point needed laboring), anyone who thinks&nbsp;that they have such opportunity in the same measure as whites is deluding&nbsp;himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this should be taken as an excuse to denigrate Jordan's&nbsp;talent. But it is a shame that America's obsession with sports means that&nbsp;his kind of talent is celebrated more than that of other men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the city prepared for the NBA Finals, Chicago magazine ran an&nbsp;article on Cyrus Colter, who in his long life has been one of Chicago's&nbsp;leading black lawyers, academics and public servants, and who, when most&nbsp;men would have put on the slippers, took to writing award-winning novels,&nbsp;short stories and poems.

Executives with Moog, a St. Louis-based maker of auto parts, said the new division will concentrate on steering and suspension products for vehicles.  Another division handles the company's temperature control business.  Corey was formerly senior vice president for finance and administration.  Corey will report to Larry W. McCurdy, president and chief executive officer of the company.  U.S. NATIONAL BANK Geoghegan Named President, CEO Dennis J. Geoghegan has been named president and chief executive of U.S.  National Bank of Clayton, the company said Thursday.  U.S. National opened in 1988 and has $26 million in assets.  Geoghegan was vice chairman of Mark Twain Bancshares' Ellisville bank in charge of generating new business.  MISSOURI FOOD BARN Official Says Business Returning Business dropped by about 18 percent during the first couple weeks of a strike that began March 3 but has since started to come back, a Food Barn official said in Kansas City.  P.A. Rawalt, Food Barn's vice president of human resources, said the company's business had increased by about 9.5 percent two weeks ago and another 3 percent last week.  The union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 576, has claimed business is down by 75 percent.  Rawalt also said 1,048 employees have crossed the union picket lines, which couldn't be immediately confirmed by union officials. The local represents about 2,500 Food Barn employees, about 2,100 of them union members, at 47 stores in Missouri and Kansas, most in the Kansas City area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union members went on strike after soundly rejecting a new contract that would have required about $18 million in concessions over three years.  Rawalt said Food Barn is the only remaining unionized grocery in the Kansas City area and can't continue to compete.  AP ILLINOIS CATERPILLAR INC.  195 Employees To Be Laid Off Caterpillar Inc. said Thursday that 195 hourly employees will be laid off indefinitely from the company's Peoria-area plants, effective April 1.  The layoffs are necessary to bring production of diesel engines in line with demand, according to a statement from the company. Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of tractors and other earth-moving equipment.  It employed about 60,000 people overall as of mid-1990.  AP NATIONAL L.A.

Thursday launched a counter-offensive in the ''sneaker war,'' firing a $3 billion lawsuit at rival </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. that charged it with trying to monopolize the market for high-tech sneakers and drive L.A.  Gear out of the business.  The countersuit was filed after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the nation's largest marketer of athletic footwear, last month sued L.A.

Gear said it believes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is trying to monopolize the high-technology basketball shoe market and eliminate L.A. Gear as a major competitor.  Los Angeles-based L.A. Gear also said its countersuit denies that its new CATAPULT shoe technology infringes any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patents.  In its suit, filed in federal court in California on Feb. 15, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had alleged that six models of basketball shoes sold by L.A.

Reuters FDIC Bank Insurance Fund Shrank 37 The nation's bank insurance fund shrank 37 percent last year and will probably need to borrow $10 billion this year to keep bailing out depositors of failed banks, a top banking regulator said Thursday.  L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said the FDIC's fund suffered an operating loss of $4.85 billion in 1990.  ''To be conservative and to ensure that we have the funds we need on time, we will need, we believe, at least $10 billion this year and that could be higher if we experience conditions worse than we currently are forecasting,'' Seidman said.  He also warned that the fund may have to borrow $35 billion by the end of 1993 - part of a new Treasury proposal that would let it borrow up to $70 billion to protect depositors.  Reuters INTERNATIONAL AVIATION EC Asks For New Trade Agreement The European Community, locked in a dispute with Washington on whether its subsidies on Airbus aircraft violate free trade rules, asked Thursday for a new trade agreement to make clear what government support was allowed.  It asked the Civil Aircraft Committee of the 101-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to renegotiate GATT's Civil Aircraft Code to clarify the matter and avoid such disputes, a trade source said.  The United States charges that European subsidies to the four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium unfairly cut into the market of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The EC, in turn, says military contracts give American aircraft companies an unfair advantage.  Reuters</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIANAPOLIS - In the quest to be No. 1, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABCD high school basketball camp clearly was the place to be the past several days.  One hundred twenty players, considered the top high school players in the country, gathered on the courts and in some classrooms of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. Each would love to be considered the best in the land.  Several hundred college coaches gathered in the stands from the beginning of the camp Friday. All would like to win a national championship one day.  Recruiting from among those 120 players, a group that included Collinsville High's Richard Keene, holds the key to their future.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Academic Betterment and Career Development camp - hence the ABCD - is the most prestigious of summer basketbal l camps. It has been inviting the top 10 dozen players each year for nine seasons and has become the standard by which such camps are judged. In one respect, it is the pinnacle of a player's high school career.  In another, it merely represents a beginning.  ''Sometimes, some of these guys gear up as much for this camp as for their regular high school season,'' DePaul coach Joey Meyer said. ''They'll start working out three weeks before just with this camp in mind. For some others, it's just a summer camp.'' As the players quickly find out, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp is anything but just another summer camp. And not simply because of the caliber of talented players and coaches who show up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ''academic betterment'' half of the title occupies far more time than does the development of basketball skills at the camp, which concludes today.  ''What happens out here on the court, this is the fun part of the week,'' point guard Jason Kidd said. Going into the camp, California-native Kidd held the unofficial distinction of being the top senior-to-be in the country.  ''But this is my third year here, and I know now that the basketball isn't the most important part of this camp,'' Kidd said. ''All the time we spend in the classrooms and listening to the speakers, that's the most important thing here. They're trying to prepare us for college by telling us things we don't always hear back in school.'' Of the 56 players selected in the recent National Basketball Association draft, 13 attended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp one year.  But what of the 107 others who were at the camp that year? For them, the basketball dream is finished. They need to rely on whatever education they were able to get with their athletic scholarships.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which spends nearly $100,000 each year in sponsoring the camp, has come to emphasize preparing the players more for the college experience than for the college basketball they will encounter.  Camp director Sonny Vaccaro, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representative and former high school teacher and coach, said his vision for the camp arose from a need to help the student-athlete put basketball in a proper perspective.  ''Over the last eight years, we've learned that the reality of what it takes to succeed academically and athletically at the collegiate level is shocking to most high school student-athletes,'' he said. ''In addition to adjusting to heavy academic schedules, these blue-chip athletes, who have been treated as superstars, are not prepared to be viewed as just average college freshmen players. Our program helps them deal with this transition.  ''We impress upon the student-athletes, while they're still young, that what they do in the classroom will affect their futures more than their performances on the courts. Of course, we tell them that they have the potential to play college ball somewhere.  ''But we also tell them over and over that their basketball-playing days will end long before their lives will.'' More than anything, the camp is designed to help the athletes learn to face their responsibility to improve, both on the court and in the classroom.  On the court, that challenge to be better becomes obvious when they play with and against other all-stars. But basketball takes just a small part of each day. Each player gets just 42 minutes of court time each day in two different game sessions.  Conversely, each of them spends five hours of the day in a classroom setting.  Each athlete is pretested upon arrival for skill levels in reading, writing and studying. The results of the test allow camp officials to divide players into programs best suited to their levels. For three hours each morning, the various classes work on honing specialized skills they will need in a college classroom, from finding main ideas while reading to learning how to read college-level journals.  All of them also will get tips on taking lecture notes, improving study habits, learning strategies for exam preparation, using a college library and writing college applications.  In the afternoon, alternating with game sessions and meals, the players hear guest speakers such as Dick Vitale, the former coach and current basketball announcer; and Ed McDonald, a lawyer and former chief prosecuting attorney on the anti-crime task force. Film producer Spike Lee disappointed campers last week when he canceled a scheduled talk, but the campers still got their fill of topics such as drug abuse, financial aid, basketball and the media, and vocational choices.  The schedule each day is rigid and exhausting.  ''For a lot of these kids, it's the first time somebody is really making them toe the line,'' camp academic director Frank DuBois said.  DuBois, a counselor at Homewood-Flossmoor High in the Chicago metro area, assembled a staff of top educators to help at the camp. Their need probably exceeds that of any coach.  ''We have kids in our program right now that are reading significantly below their grade level,'' DuBois said. ''Sure, I'm shocked. And I'm disturbed. I think a lot of them do not have the ac ademic skills they need to compete with an average college student.  ''People have been telling them how great they are. They are very gifted athletes, but they are not necessarily that good in other skills.  ''In a week, I think we can teach them some tools. We can give them an idea of what college is going to be like and how demanding it's going to be to be a student-athlete. We can help them focus their energy in other directions besides basketball.'' Camp instructors such as DuBois might have an important message. But they don't have quite the appeal for the players as do counselors such as Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning, Connecticut's Chris Smith and Kentucky's John Pelphrey. And the college coaches in the stands - Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, Bobby Knight of Indiana, Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech, Lou Carnesecca of St.  John's - name the coach, he probably was there - cast an eye-catching glow.  ''I was really nervous the first time I was here,'' Kidd said. ''I was looking in the stands at the coaches more than at the players on the court, even while I was playing.'' The camp directors hope to remind the players - or maybe tell them for the first time - that they will be going to college primarily for the education and not solely to play basketball.  ''There are going to be a lot who leave here who still think that,'' Meyer said. ''There are no assurances that because they hear these things from Dick Vitale and others that their ideas will change.  ''Recruiting spoils them.'' The intentions of the camp being what they are, the recruiting aspect still draws the most attention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't invite any non-basketball players, and it didn't invite basketball players of middling talent but with a great need for classroom assistance.  And when Knight and Krzyzewski sat side by side in the bleachers Saturday afternoon, they weren't watching the players try to solve an algebra problem.  The coaches aren't able to talk to the players, but they can evaluate and further narrow their recruiting list.  ''I don't think there's a day in July when I'm not at a game,'' Meyer said.  ''They have crammed so much into this one month. But this really is the best place to be, with the people who are here.  ''With certain kids, it's a matter of being seen. But sometimes I wonder: How can these kids know who's here when they see the bleachers full of all those faces?''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Jordan was talking about Dominique Wilkins, and the words weren't friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I know what he's doing,'' Jordan said suspiciously before the NBA All- Star Game. ''When someone's on top of you, you try to knock him off. But I'm going to take a Carolina approach, and keep it clean, and stay on top.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly had 'Nique been doing to Jordan? Body slams in the lane? Submarining him on layups?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, Wilkins had committed the sin that has been forbidden since Elvis warned the world not to step on his blue suede shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilkins is among the Reebok crew of ''pump up'' endorsers who have been needling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on television ads. Air bags vs. Air Jordan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to take legal action against Reebok's leapers, a case made for a kangaroo court if ever there was one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it about shoes that breeds such hostility?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been a source of easily injured pride dating to when ''Your mother wears combat boots'' still was an insult. For all her faults, what really bugged us about Imelda Marcos was her warehouse full of shoes. And those who like to tweak Nevada-Las Vegas about its courtside seats filled with high-rollers always snidely refer to it as ''Gucci Row.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boston's Dee Brown kicked the shoe confrontation up a notch Saturday, when he paused before each of his attempts in the dunk contest to pump up his Reeboks. Dee-bok swears it was his idea, and maybe so, but somewhere a commercial is being filmed of the newly crowned slam champ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe Reebok should be worried. Playgrounds are on the verge of becoming pumpatoriums. The inevitable peer pressure could lead to a new kind of game of chicken, to see who can take the most pumps. Watch out for the injury of the '90s: ankle strangulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amazing how far we've come from the days when there truly was only one shoe a dignified athlete could wear. The Converse Chuck Taylor model came only in white and black. Why they bothered to have the black model was a mystery, because only the Celtics wore them and they made even the world champs look dorky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the major breakthrough in the '60s. Someone in the back shop let a pair of scissors slip, and thus the low-cut was born. Wow. Two styles. This is like when Baskin-Robbins served only chocolate and vanilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok are at the same kind of odds as Coke and Pepsi. One wonders how much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jealousy has to do with the Laker Girls' collective bustline being turned into a Reebok billboard. Or that infamous but quickly pulled ad with the bungee-cord jumpers, where the Reebok-shorn guy survives but the kid clad in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disappears into the abyss (kind of like going to the Sacramento Kings).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoe battles aren't new. The first two companies to go at it - adidas and Puma - were run by German brothers named Dassler who carried on a lifelong feud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the stakes are high, as L.A. Gear learned when it suffered a public relations disaster in December. Marquette freshman Robb Logterman drove the lane at Kansas, only to suffer a blowout the likes of which even Goodyear seldom sees. His shoe simply fell apart, and left behind in the paint was Logterman's filet of sole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turned out Marquette was going through its L.A. Gear (Joe Montana's brand) by the gross, and within the month the Warriors switched to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also got the last word before All-Star weekend ended, as Jordan got a foothold on revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sunday's All-Star Game, Wilkins blew the opportunity to become the all- time ham of slam. With no defender near, Wilkins went up for one of the from- the-hip, over-the-shoulder power dunks that he invented, only to miss. This is what's called an air dunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After seeing Wilkins suffer the ultimate showtime embarrassment, Jordan issued an epitaph for the times: ''He forgot to pump up.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To hype its flashy sneakers, British Knights has a new TV ad saying ''your mother wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sure hopes so. At last weekend's Super Show in Atlanta, it pitched to retailers a shoe line meant for feet with families - ''All Conditions Gear.'' They're shoes ready to turn a camp ing trip into ''cross-training.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it the new brown-shoe market - now that slowing baby-boomers are leaving basketball's and tennis' white-shoe market behind and are ready to pay for pricey new gear, ranging from $ 80-$ 175.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> already has cashed in on outdoor apparel catering to the increasing interest in backpacking, camping, trekking and mountain biking - a sport in which participation levels rose 114% between 1987 and 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The push into shoes, says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marketer Craig Duerr, ''helps us keep going beyond the ice-pick crowd.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faces another crowd: Reebok and adidas, who are coming out with outdoor shoe lines. First, adidas USA, which last year posted its first profit in five years, has a new Adventure line - topped by a Trekker shoe at $ 175.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok will use its inflatable pump system in Reebok Outdoor shoes, footwear positioned as friends of the Earth. In stores, shoes will be placed on wood instead of plastic shelves. Luckily, Reebok will plant a tree for each pair sold. ''We see the '90s as a decade of family, wellness and the environment,'' says Reebok marketer Joe Gugleilmetti. And you don't want to be caught without the right shoes for all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other new items at the Super Show, the largest sports products trade show in the USA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A HOT COOLER: Coleman, the Wichita, Kan., camping gear company, offers a portable electric cooler that can be plugged into cars or homes. It can reach 40 degrees below, or 70 degrees above, outside air temperature. But versatility doesn't come cheaply. Regular coolers cost about $ 30; the new Coleman model will sell for about $ 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- SAFE AT HOME: Lay Sporting Goods of Sandy, Utah, hopes to mechanize backyard baseball. The Chucker pitching machine, which delivers baseballs, softballs and plastic balls at up to 54 mph, weighs less (48 pounds) and costs less (about $ 500) than many pitching machines used by Little League teams. Replacement windows for your neighborhood aren't included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- TALK TO ME: CSA Inc. of South Easton, Mass., offers an expanded line of 23 exercise machines with talking computers. The chatty line includes step- climbers, cross-country ski simulators and rowers. The computers talk you through an elaborate series and calculate your pace. Or maybe they'll just keep you from getting lonely. This talk isn't cheap: The ski machines retail for about $ 500, although lower-priced machines are in the works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- MY BODY, MY SCORE: It might look just like a battery-operated, hand-held computer. But LEAP Inc. of Eugene, Ore., says its new $ 380 Individual Trainer is actually a ''personal fitness system.'' To operate, you enter information about yourself, the weather and the sport - from a menu of 120 activities ranging from aerobics to yoga. The machine rewards points for your efforts. The idea is to keep people from overdoing workouts, says LEAP's Robert Droste, because the computer lets you ''give yourself permission to stop.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- SKIP YOUR WAY TO BIGGER BICEPS: Spalding is ready to tinker with the simplest sports gear - jump ropes. Its $ 35-50 plastic SportRopes are weighted - in one-, two-, three- and four-pound models - to keep your upper body from getting off scot-free. But the ropes don't talk to you or give you permission to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- BRIEFLY: Coleman doesn't sell Elvis Presley cooking stoves - at least, not yet. But the company, through cross-licensing deals, offers new MTV coolers and inexpensive new kids sleeping bags depicting Captain America, Spiderman, glow-in-the-dark dinosaurs and others. ... Franklin Sports has an elaborate line of official National Hockey League street hockey gear, including neon nets for night play. ... A Roger Clemens instructional baseball, from Shawnee Mission, Kan., simplifies pitching. Markings indicate where to place each of your fingers. ... </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed its lightest running shoe ever: the 9.5-ounce Huarache model. No, it's not made of thin strips of leather. But the heel counter has been replaced with a rubber strap. ... Among tennis racquet marketers, wide-bodies are still seen as the way to bigger sales. Prince, for instance, introduced a Vortex model that is said to borrow from the aerospace industry. Wide-body prices are taking off - high- end models are nearing $ 300. ... It has happened: Zojirushi American Corp. introduced the ''world's first canteen-shaped stainless steel thermal vacuum bottle.'' Apparently, the Tuff Army canteen is battle-tested: It's endorsed by the Canadian Armed Forces. ... Among Cramer Product's new Bo Jackson Bo Med brand sports medicine line: Bo Jock Itch Powder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes have begun washing up on Oregon beaches - the result of a May 1990 shipping accident that left 80,000 sneakers floating in the Pacific.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some beachcombers are stockpiling hundreds of shoes, claiming the shoes are fine - after clams and seaweed are removed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Listen up, Michael Jordan. Your fans at Banneker Community Center say your </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan sneakers cost too much. Oh, they've been buying them. But Willie Dinkins, 16 ; Jerry Nettles, 11; and Chris Morris, 10 - your basic neighborhood kids - say $ 125 for a pair of Jordans is out of line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're not the only ones. Serious and not-so-serious athletes are getting weary of expensive sneaks, even as sneaker companies are coming out with higher -tech and higher priced -shoes for tennis, softball, walking, running - you name it. Reebok offers its $ 159.95 Pump II this fall and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is adding the ''all terrain'' $ 115 Air Mowabb to a lineup that includes the $ 150 Air Force 180 basketball shoe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporting Goods Business magazine recently polled buyers and found a consumer backlash: 86% said $ 100 sneakers are a marketing gimmick designed to take advantage of consumers. Although buyers snapped up 393 million pairs of athletic shoes in 1990, making sneakers an $ 11.7 billion industry (annual revenue), more than 80% chose shoes priced under $ 35. Only 1.4% buy shoes costing more than $ 64.50, down slightly from 1989, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resistance to high prices could hurt an industry that has hit a wall in growth. The number of shoes sold in 1990 was up just 1.1% vs. the year before, according to the manufacturers association. That pales next to past growth: In 1988, volume was up 7.4%. The industry has kept earnings up the past two years mainly by raising prices. From 1988 to 1990, prices rose 17.7%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer caution during this recession may even spur an industry wide shake out. ''There's going to be blood on the streets before this year is out,'' warns Bob Carr, editorial director of Sporting Goods Business. ''There are too many brands. There are at least 25 companies with $ 20 million or more in sales. If they don't have a niche, they're just going to founder.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so long ago, most people made do with one pair of $ 15 sneakers. But with today's highly touted footwear, a fairly athletic person could wind up with $ 800 worth of sneaks - the price of a refrigerator, or a fling in Bermuda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet consumers are not likely to abandon high-end sneakers. A small, steadfast number of athletes and aging baby boomers think $ 150 sneakers, with their air-pumping gadgets or tiny pillows of ''secret gas,'' will cushion creaking knees or help their daily run. Some teen -agers have to have their heroes' shoes, even if paying for them is painful. ''The kid will not go to school with a Ked or K mart sneaker,'' says Chuck Hinton, 57, former Washington Senators baseball player who works at the Banneker center. ''It's not fashionable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, recession has been unkind to the white -collar crowd that could most easily afford $ 100 sneakers. With the threat to higher-income jobs comes an attitude change, from yuppie acquisitiveness and a penchant for labels to new respect for dollar value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's good news for lower-priced shoes, such as Keds. The unglamorous shoe by Stride Rite has quietly moved from the rear of the pack to fourth- largest in domestic footwear sales, ahead of Converse. Keds' revenue has increased about five-fold in five years to $ 280 million in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top sneaker manufacturers spend fortunes trying to convince shoppers to buy. Most of the ads focus on top-of-the-line products like Air Jordans, which, retailers say, draw customers who may then opt for a less-expensive shoe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the No. 1 manufacturer, spends $ 100 million a year on advertising, often featuring Jordan or David Robinson, while Reebok, No. 2, spends $ 70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which dominates the market with revenue of $ 2.2 billion in 1990 and an expected $ 3 billion in 1991, is trying to maintain market share as growth slows among its primary buyers, men in the USA. Its</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares of United Telecommunications Inc., owner of long-distance company Sprint, sank 1 1/8 to $ 23 5/8 Monday as investors worried that Sprint may lose or have to adjust a contract with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Accounting Office claims the federal government is paying AT&amp;T and Sprint $ 148 million more in the next two years than it should. It said Sprint charges too much. That could lead Congress to force Sprint to cut rates. AT&amp;T and Sprint share a $ 25 billion contract to provide the government with long-distance phone service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But analysts say investor concerns about Sprint losing the contract are exaggerated. A lot of the fuss, they say, has been caused by MCI, which doesn't have a piece of the contract and keeps telling the government it could do the job more cheaply than either AT&amp;T or Sprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says Sprint already has cut long-distance rates several times to bring them in line with AT&amp;T's rates. Gross says investors are worried that Sprint could lose a portion of its contract in 1993 after the contract is rebid. But that's unlikely. ''There is a rebid in the fourth year of the contract, but only between the two existing players,'' Gross says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoe-in: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.  gained 3 to $ 51 1/8 after the company reported a record quarter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had net income of $ 114.4 million, or $ 1.50 a share - vs. $ 99.7 million, or $ 1.31 a share, last year. It had record revenue of $ 947 million. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Richard Donahue told Reuter news service that he will expand his workforce by 500 to about 5,000 worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong first-quarter results surprised Wall Street, which had worried that consumers would balk at buying high-priced athletic shoes during a recession. But ''price resistance hasn't hit yet,'' says Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson. ''People will continue to pay north of $ 100 for sneakers.'' Still, Jacobson is in no rush to buy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shares. ''Now's the time to stay on the sidelines,'' he advises. He thinks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is vulnerable until a recovery is evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned that next quarter could be weak. The company's worldwide orders for shoes and apparel scheduled for delivery between now and January are $ 1.1 billion - up 2% from last year. But Jacobson had been looking for a 7% gain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The careers of two-sport athlete Bo Jackson, an intriguing and highly recognized figure -- both on the field and from his &quot;Bo Knows&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials -- have bumped head-on into the threat of an abrupt end. The Kansas City Royals announced late yesterday they would waive outfielder Jackson this morning because of a hip injury they believe will prevent him from playing baseball this year and possibly ever again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royals physicians also believe the injury will keep Jackson from playing any more football for the Los Angeles Raiders. However, the Raiders are hoping that is not the case.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to speculate,&quot; Raiders Coach Art Shell said in Hawaii, at the annual meeting of the NFL owners. &quot;The doctor gave me some name of the injury . . . and [said] with rest he would be all right. . . . I don't understand all that medical language, but to me they said it was a slight dislocation. Until I hear differently I'll expect him to be able to play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for baseball, with Jackson released, any major league team can claim him for $ 1 in a waiver period ending at 2 p.m. Friday. The New York Yankees, as the American League team with the worst 1990 record, would have first crack; their front office expressed caution pending medical analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner as a senior at Auburn, surprised many when he announced he would play professional baseball, not football, despite being the No. 1 pick in the 1986 NFL draft, by Tampa Bay. He signed with the Royals, but in 1987 stunned them by signing to play running back for the Raiders when the baseball season ended. A prodigious home run hitter and breakaway ball carrier, last year he batted .272 for the Royals and, as usual making the switch after the baseball season, scored five NFL touchdowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one hour before the Royals' announcement at their Haines City, Fla., training base, Jackson said in Birmingham he feels he will return to playing baseball this year, and a sports medicine specialist who examined him did not rule out a return to football as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't count me out, I know deep down I'll be back playing baseball this year,&quot; said Jackson, 28, who appeared with Dr. James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, serving in this instance as his personal physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This action is taken with deep regret,&quot; Royals General Manager Herk Robinson said. &quot;The . . . organization is deeply appreciative to Bo for his contributions . . . We wish him and his family the very best of health and success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson said the Royals would pay one-sixth of the $ 2,375,000 salary Jackson would have received had he been on the opening-day roster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Robinson told the media. &quot;We [have] nearly $ 2.5 million involved . . . finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Joyce, the Royals' team physician, said Jackson has a fracture-dislocation of his left hip and the injury, sustained in the Jan. 13 Raiders-Cincinnati Bengals playoff game, has resulted in cartilage damage in the hip socket. Joyce felt that Jackson definitely should not play baseball this year, although other doctors consulted by the Royals thought there was a possibility Jackson may play again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce revealed that Jackson asked him not to tell the club about the severity of the injury after he examined the athlete in February. That was before scheduled salary arbitration, which was avoided when Jackson and the club agreed on a contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did examine Bo prior to the arbitration hearing, and I did inform the Royals' trainer,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;But Bo did ask me not to speak to Royals management. It was a balancing act between being realistic with the Royals and being positive with the patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under baseball's Basic Agreement, a player cannot be released because of injury, but the Royals deem this a football injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Raiders' team physician, Robert Rosenfeld, would not comment on Jackson's condition. Jackson reportedly has a guaranteed contract with the Raiders assuring him $ 1,617,500 in salary and bonuses in 1991 whether he plays or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews in Birmingham did not give a specific diagnosis of the hip damage but said it is a &quot;significant injury&quot; and blood flow to the hip joint is being monitored. The doctor, who has done surgery on several major sports figures, declined to elaborate when asked about reports that Jackson may suffer avascular necrosis, a potentially career-ending condition in which bone tissue dies because blood cannot reach it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in a protective phase at this point,&quot; said Andrews, who left open the possibility that Jackson eventually may be able to play football again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been no collapse of his hip joint,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;That's the reason we're putting him on crutches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another potential problem that faces Jackson could be his contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to NFL agents and general managers who say they are familiar with the basics of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract, Jackson -- so closely associated with the shoe company that in February one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> headquarters buildings in Beaverton, Ore., was named after him -- could lose as much as $ 4 million should the injury force him to play just one or no professional sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the sources, the total worth of his contract is about $ 5 million (the length of the contract was unknown), but much of it is based on easily attainable incentives. Should he play only one sport, the sources said, he would get between $ 1 and $ 2 million; no sports, the sources said, about $ 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Dolan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vice president and director of corporate communications, said there &quot;are no conditions in our contract that require him to play two sports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dolan quickly added, &quot;There are incentives for certain achievements, but that's not the same as conditions. Of course, he would probably get more money from playing two sports, but that's not conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolan said one such condition is that if he makes two all-star teams he would receive two bonuses. Jackson was the most valuable player in baseball's 1989 All-Star Game and has been a Pro Bowl selection in football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Jackson could lose money from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if the injury forced him to retire, Dolan said: &quot;I don't want to say yes or no because it's still early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no intention of canceling the contract. The firm probably couldn't even if it wanted to, as sources said most of the money is probably guaranteed. &quot;We have never canceled a contract because of an injury,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;Bo is very important to us. We expect to stick by Bo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One spot, which will begin nationally during the National Basketball Association's All-Star Game on Feb. 10, features Mr. Lee as his &quot;Mars Blackmon&quot; character, joking around with Mr. Jordan, the Chicago Bulls star. After a slightly intense discussion about the principles of gravity, they tell other kids in the classroom, &quot;Don't be stupid; stay in school.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These spots are important to me because education is the key,&quot; Mr. Lee said in an interview. &quot;Spike and Michael saying 'stay in school' is not the only answer, but it helps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, we tried to put humor in,&quot; the Brooklyn film maker said. &quot;We're not trying to be too preachy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. has been criticized in the past for using black athletes in its ads but having few of them in as corporate executives. Mr. Lee said some of the criticisms were valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said: &quot;We have tried to work some of these things out. I wish a lot of other companies were as open minded as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They want to do the right thing. No pun intended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, first matched Mr. Lee and Mr. Jordan in 1989.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earnings for the three months ended Nov. 30 totaled $61.5 million, or 80 cents a share. In the comparable period last year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earned $58 million, or 77 cents a share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revenues increased 15 percent, to $743.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European sales led the increase, with Germany up 73 percent, France up 63 percent, Italy up 138 percent and Spain up 83 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States athletic footwear revenues declined 2 percent, but domestic athletic apparel revenues were up 2 percent. Revenues from other brands owned by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose 18 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the domestic athletic footwear revenues were lower because retailers had been cautious in placing orders six months ago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT was the third raid in as many weeks. A team of officers from Customs headquarters swooped on a warehouse at Sydney Airport to seize another consignment of counterfeit sports shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alarm bells began ringing when Customs computers picked up details of a consignment recently flown from South Korea to Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clues added up - a suspicious importer, an infamous country of origin and an extremely vague description of contents and value.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importer had been given one too many chances to complete the description of goods and soon the computer alert was flashing wildly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consignment contained sports shoes of various brands, a practice not usually carried out by legitimate distributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the boxes were located after an anxious half-hour, Customs officers found exactly what they had expected - 700 pairs of counterfeit Reeboks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importer had tried to hide these by listing the runners under other brand names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The runners were in plastic bags, not boxes - a giveaway to vigilant Customs officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first glance, the shoes looked genuine but a closer examination revealed that country of origin tags and composition tags were missing and that the shoes were of poor quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some runners, with glue smeared across them, were so bad the soles could be twisted easily and the heel cup pushed in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board linings under the inner sole were also poorly made and when the tongues were pulled back the material was frayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Janeczko , Customs' NSW import/export regional manager,said the importer, like many others involved in counterfeiting, was a small-time entrepreneur obviously planning to sell the runners at weekend markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footwear experts have warned they can be damaging to the feet. But in many cases Customs are unable to act to keep these fakes off the street. Australia's leading importers are now rushing to take out protection under the Trademarks Act which gives Customs the power they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CUSTOMS officials believe many of the counterfeit goods originate from the mainly Asian factories of the legitimate manufacturers, where &quot;moonlighting&quot;workers make the fakes from leftover pieces of the genuine shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These shoes would probably sell for around $50, well under half the price the genuine product would sell for with a legitimate dealer,&quot; Mr Janeczko said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I simply cannot believe the gullibility of the public who buy runners at prices they should realise cannot be genuine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designer label runners, the fashion statement of the 90s, can cost up $300to with most pairs selling for around $150.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counterfeit pairs sell for between $40 and $100 at markets and while the public may believe they are coming out the winner, the runners may cost as little as $6 to produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously many of the runners fall apart within a matter of days or weeks and the damage to our reputation is as great as the potential loss of revenue,&quot; said Keith Forbes, a spokesman from Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REEBOK, the best-known brand, has been the main target for counterfeiters and Reebok International spends millions of dollars every year on litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian company has joined several high-profile designers and manufacturers to create the Anti-Counterfeit Action Group to lobby for increased penalties and monitor counterfeit activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would estimate Reebok and other importers in this country are losing up to $8 million each year to the counterfeit industry,&quot; Mr Forbes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you buy a pair of Reeboks or other runners at the weekend markets, chances are you will walk away with a counterfeit pair. I would say it's a 99.9 per cent chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adidas controller John Warnock said his company would not like to speculate on the size of the counterfeit industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What turns up in Customs raids could be just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Forbes believes Reebok has frightened off a number of counterfeiters who are now attempting to join the market with fake Adidas and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> runners which have only recently begun appearing in Customs raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN the past two months, Customs officers have been concentrating on imports of runners from South Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one raid 2,100 pairs of fake sports shoes were found in a container of goods - 600 pairs of fake Reeboks and Adidas and 1,500 branded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another raid turned up 720 pairs of fake Reeboks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such raids have prompted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to join Reebok, Adidas and others to seek protection under the Trademarks Act giving Customs the power to investigate and seize imports of counterfeit products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the number of shoes Customs are turning up in their investigations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> felt if was obliged to take immediate steps for protection,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> solicitor Simon Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the consignment Customs seized last week officers found, apart from the 700 fake Reeboks, brands of runners which, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, were not covered under the Trademarks Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These possibly counterfeit runners also had country of origin and composition tags missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customs will hold these brands until the importer attaches these tags to meet import regulations. Customs cannot take action to keep the runners off the market because the brands are not covered under the Trademarks Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Reebok&quot; runners will be held pending charges against the importer of breach of Copyright Act which could lead to fines of up to $1,000 and the runners being destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW TO SPOT A FAKE RUNNER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 Poor quality finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Weak heel cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 Weak sole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Missing country of origin tag and composition tag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 Plastic or vinyl instead of leather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 Frayed material under tongue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 Poor quality board lining under inner sole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 Genuine Reeboks should have size tag under or on side of tongue with US, UK and European sizes and factory codes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IVAN KELIC is the strongest forward in the National Soccer League thi season and that's one of the reasons why he has become such a dangerous striker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the claim of Alan Davidson, who has seen Kelic's development in his three seasons at Melbourne Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've got rugged defenders like Andrew Marth and George Hannah but in 50-50 clashes at training Marth has bounced off while Kelic has held his ground,&quot; Davidson said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's all brute strength now and that's made it hard for defenders to knock him off the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic equalled an NSL record on Sunday becoming only the second player to score six goals in one game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His feat easily earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the weekly winner he collects a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners worth $280.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic, however, believes his teammates deserve most of the credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was the easiest game I've ever played in - I just stood up front and put the ball in the net,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After I scored the third from a penalty, there was a real chance of becoming the league's top scorer and my teammates started playing to me.&quot; Kelic has been working on weights in the gym three times a week.&quot;I've felt much stronger and that too has helped in the confidence.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His goals this season have raised suggestions of a place in the Socceroo squad but Kelic is not getting carried away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main priority is to help Melbourne Croatia make the grand final and win it. If I was to get a call-up from Eddie Thomson, it would be a bonus,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic is the fourth player to win the award twice this season. With one round left, anyone from eight can win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the weekly award of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners, the overall winner receives $2000 from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot Award.

Since April 2, Burke and Lisa Pond have found more than 140 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes on beaches between the mouth of the Columbia River and Gearhart.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve McLoed, who until recently had never owned a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe, now boasts about 70. Shirley Tarnasky has found 50 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near her oceanfront home in Rockaway Beach. But the shoes are not coming ashore in pairs, prompting Tarnasky to form the Sneaker Society to promote sneaker swaps at which people can trade to create matching pairs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transportation manager Rich Hastings said yesterday that the shoes were from five boxcar-size containers that fell from a Seattle-bound cargo ship in the Pacific Ocean in May last year.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children's Television Workshop, the educational production company responsible for bringing Sesame Street to public television, has announced that it would begin work on an ambitious new series intended to improve children's reading and writing skills.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The series, called The Ghostwriter, is scheduled to begin on PBS stations in the fall of 1992. The target audience will be children 7 to 10 years old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's Television Workshop announced the beginning of production after receiving a commitment for a $ 5-million grant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the maker of athletic shoes. Nana Griller, the assistant director of information at Children's Television Workshop, said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grant was the largest single corporate donation ever made to a children's television show.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show's overall budget will be $ 20-million for 48 episodes, with about $ 8.8-million coming from PBS and Children's Television Workshop, and the rest from other foundation and government sources.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard K. Donahue, president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the company would also help promote the project. He said that could mean guest appearances by some of the athletes, including Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and David Robinson, who have endorsed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decided to be the sole corporate backer of the series as part of a larger program aimed at advocating education for inner-city children, Donahue said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the company's commitment in this area had been longstanding and was not related to recent criticism for urging children to buy expensive athletic shoes, a charge he called a &quot;canard.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive producer of The Ghostwriter is Elizabeth Nealon, formerly vice president of MTV International.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show's stylistic approach will incorporate visual and musical techniques borrowed from MTV, Ms. Griller said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format will use graphics to make reading the print on screen more entertaining.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories will center on six children, three girls and three boys, and their interaction with an unseen ghost who can communicate with them only through writing.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's Television Workshop will also publish an accompanying magazine and teachers' materials, as well as computer games using the series' characters.<BR> &quot;China Beach' returning in June for seven weeks<BR> Associated Press<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOS ANGELES The Vietnam War series China Beach will return to temporary active duty next month, network officials announced last week.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emmy-winning series was suspended in December, but ABC had promised to air the seven remaining episodes made for the 1990-91 season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The episodes will air for seven weeks, beginning June 4, in the coveted prime time slot of thirtysomething.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network move follows a lobbying campaign by executive producer John Sacret Young, who urged thousands of supporters to write protest letters to ABC executives.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The series has been placed on hiatus twice and pushed to new time slots three times during a four-year run on ABC.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of China Beach is not yet known. ABC will announce its fall schedule this week.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Lewis of Portland, Ore., has a masters degree in bio-nutrition<BR>and taught at a New England private college, which in no way explains how<BR>she came up with the idea of manufacturing walking shoes from recycled<BR>garbage. &quot;I just liked the idea of creating something practical from<BR>recycled material,&quot; said Lewis, whose creativity has resulted in other,<BR>less successful, inventions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Lewis's walking shoes are made from recycled polypropylene, paper bags,<BR>coffee filters, reclaimed tires, foam rubber and scrap metal. The idea for<BR>the shoe came from conversations with tire recyclers and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> founder Bill<BR>Bowerman. The invention of a machine that weaves recycled polypropylene<BR>made it possible. The first 5,000 pairs (they're called DejaShoes and<BR>retail for $59 in the United States) are scheduled to reach the market<BR>soon, she says. The company plans other styles, including a chukka boot<BR>and a sandal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson was released from his baseball contract with the Kansas City<BR>Royals before the beginning of the season because of hip injuries suffered<BR>during the National Football League season, when he plays for the Los<BR>Angeles Raiders. He signed with the Chicago White Sox and may start<BR>playing after the all-star break.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bartender is curious, so he agrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dog,&quot; says the bum, &quot;how did I feel when I got up this morning?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ruff,&quot; the dog replies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Roof,&quot; says the dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dog,&quot; continues the bum, &quot;who was the greatest baseball player of all<BR>time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ruth,&quot; the dog barks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bartender has seen enough and throws the bum into the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dog looks up at the bum and says, &quot;Do you think I should have said<BR>Joe DiMaggio?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c9"> The last word</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;To add injury to insult they show up wearing ties, their Rolexes and  some even bring their cellular phones. They discuss the Dow Jones averages  instead of batting averages.&quot; - Jerry Pritikin, 54, a Chicago Cubs  Bleacher Bum, who warns that the outfield seats have been invaded by  yuppies who care nothing about baseball but are there only to show off.   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Alabama company that makes Georgia hats gave Dooley, whose salary&nbsp;as football coach and athletics director at the time was $ 95,000, 12&nbsp;dozen hats and paid him 2 percent of the gross sales of Bulldogs hats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley's 1986 income was the subject of a three-year court fight&nbsp;between Dooley and The Journal-Constitution. The Georgia Supreme Court&nbsp;recently ordered Dooley, who retired as football coach Jan. 1, 1989, but&nbsp;remains athletics director, plus basketball coaches Hugh Durham and Andy&nbsp;Landers to disclose their incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar case, seeking the outside incomes of athletics officials&nbsp;at Georgia Tech, including athletics director Homer Rice, football coach&nbsp;Bobby Ross and basketball coach Bobby Cremins, is pending in Superior&nbsp;Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley's outside income is by no means unusual. Last year, for&nbsp;instance, Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz's salary was $ 90,000, but&nbsp;his total income $ 750,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley made more than 2 1/2 times his base salary by being a media&nbsp;personality (nearly $ 200,000 from TV and radio contracts), a shoe&nbsp;salesman ($ 30,000 for endorsing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> footwear), an orator ($ 12,000 from&nbsp;speaking engagements) and a camp counselor ($ 5,250 from the Bulldog&nbsp;Football Camp).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Missouri currently has a model for the non-graded primary school.At </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elementary in Catawissa, students who have previously been bound to a traditional kindergarten-through-third-grade program are now offered a 3- , 4- or 5-year program. This non-graded approach allows teachers to move children through a continuous curriculum, allowing the developmental differences.  The overall goal is to ensure that all children reach their academic potential.  Although the non-graded program has been compared to the one-room schoolhouse, marked differences exist. Age groups and grades are clearly identified, and preset graded curriculums are taught year to year in a rigid format.  As large numbers of students began to attend, school rooms were added to existing buildings, and the different grades were split apart. This more closely aligns the one-room concept to our traditional graded schools of today. Certainly much cross-age learning occurred. Younger pupils learned from listening to older classes, and older students having problems could listen as presentations were made to younger classes. Much peer tutoring was employed, both as a help for the teacher and because the children enjoyed working together.  Today's non-graded program seeks to define sets of learner objectives that allow for developmental difference s of children. Learning strategies and materials to accommodate the flexible time provisions of non-graded classrooms can be varied and diverse. What they have in common is an understanding of how to determine when the child is academically ready to move from level to level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a non-graded primary school, there is no repeating of a grade because of academic failure. Instead of retention, students are taught at a pace that ensures academic success and growth. A child may take five years to complete the traditional K-3 program, but it occurs by progressing through the primary levels at a slower pace. Teachers do not have to subvert the system to fit the child's needs but can use flexible time provisions to move a child at any time that child has met the academic criteria for each level. A three-year program is also offered at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> allowing a student to accelerate through the program with academic successes. The curriculum is flexible, expanding to challenge all children.  The developers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> non-graded primary - myself, Barb Betz and Jean Wills - have broadened the curriculum to meet student needs. They have embraced a variety of teaching strategies including cooperative learning, cross-age tutoring, extensive use of volunteers, continuous assessment and mastery learning to help each child achieve academic successes. We have not addressed or cured all the problems that face our educational system, but we believe we have taken a step in the right direction.  Karen M. Smith is a teacher at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elementary School, Catawissa, Mo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Random observations from the wide, wide world of television sports: - Bo Jackson came through a television the other night. Walked right through the sucker in an effort to express his utter disgust with the medium, one supposes.  Of course, it wasn't real. It was merely another in a seemingly endless series of clever (and somewhat disturbing) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> television commercials.  Do we know Bo in any other way?  Anyway, in this one Jackson spoofs his image (created in previous commercials, naturally) that he can do anything. In the middle of the spot, Bo walks off a lavish stage set, complete with musicians and beautiful back-up singers.  He walks right through a TV set into a living room, where he chides a little boy who is sitting there for watching too much television. He then heads to a gym where he is shown going about the difficult business of rehabilitating his career.  The career that exists outside of commercials, that is.  The message, presumably, is that what Bo is really all about is hard work and sweat, which is not exactly what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was saying in its earlier ''Bo knows'' commercials. No, those implied that everything from hockey to rocket science came naturally to this wondrous athlete.  This time, there's work involved and since the product being advertised is something worn in weight rooms and gymnasiums, it makes sense to finally put Jackson in such a setting. The message about hard work was equally welcome and Tuesday's All-Star game was a great place for the spot to make its debut.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's pause here for a healthy dose of cynicism. Bo Jackson chastising a kid for watching too much television? Bo Jackson telling us that image is not everything? Who's kidding who? Not that it is Jackson's fault, but no athlete has been dominated by his TV image more than Jackson. Jackson's pro sports career, as spectacular as it was in brief spurts, could not compete with Jackson's TV image.  Most athletes need to be at or near the top of their games to sustain a career in commercial endorsements. All Jackson had to do w as be Bo.  This advertisement is proof of that. Jackson has yet to play an inning - and may never play an inning - in a Chicago White Sox uniform, and yet his Sox uniform (stylishly black, of course) is featured prominently in this advertisement.  Bo does not have any White Sox RBIs, but he does have a White Sox image.  Thanks to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, image is what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is selling, every bit as much as sneakers.  Images perpetrated by TV commercials. Images consumed willingly by little kids (and big ones, too) who watch too much TV.  Should we listen to Bo and not watch so much TV and go out and ''just do it''? Or, should we just sit back and be overwhelmed by the amazing and attractive image of Bo? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is telling us to do the former while cleverly enticing us to do the latter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that every time you turn on the tube, flip a magazine page or gaze at a billboard, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. ''swoosh'' and a well-paid athlete are staring back at you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising firepower has taken it to the top of the athletic shoe market, but those creative and often outlandish ads don't come cheap. In the first nine months of 1990, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent $ 61.8 million for TV and radio air time, cable TV spots, newspaper and magazine pages and billboard space - up 79% from the same period in 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers come from LNA/Arbitron Multi-Media Service and Advertising Age and don't include the cost of creating the ads and payments to celebrity endorsers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No other sports company came close to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. 2 sports shoe-maker Reebok International spent $ 30.6 million in the first nine months of 1990, up 13%; Sports Illustrated spent $ 23.5 million (undoubtedly most on endless repetitions of its cable TV subscription ads featuring football phones, Michael Jordan videos, etc.), up 73% from 1989; and L.A. Gear spent $ 23.2 million, up a whopping 162%. No other sports companies cracked the top 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put those numbers in perspective, look at how much the really big spenders put out in only nine months: AT&amp;T spent $ 371.5 million and McDonald's $ 334.6 million.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> LINKAGE: New LPGA Commissioner Charles Mechem isn't pulling many punches in his analysis of the tour. In a recent interview in Golfweek, Mecham said the LPGA suffers from a ''massive inferiority complex. I don't mean that critically of anybody, but I think the organizatiom is a lot stronger that it realizes it is.'' ... Golf icon and Senior PGA Tour member Don January is getting into the golf architectural business. His partners include son Tom and Craig Curry, formerly of Jack Nicklaus and Associates.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> CHAIN GANG: Hybrid bikes aren't two-wheelers for biologists, but they are quickly moving up the evolutionary ladder. A cross between fat-tired mountain bikes and featherweight road racing bikes, hybrids are catching on with fitness fanatics and born-again cyclists. Some purists scoff, but the market loves them. According to Bicycling magazine, more than 100 of the 941 new bicycle models can be classified as hybrids, an increase of 30 products from last year's selection. The good news: The average price of a hybrid has decreased from $ 612 to $ 478. Last year's hot model was Schwinn's $ 300 Crisscross, rated a Best Buy by both Consumer Reports and Bicycle Guide. Road bike prices are up an average of 30%, while mountain bikes increased only 11%.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>COLLECT CALLS: Some people think baseball memorabilia came of age when they stopped putting gum in baseball card packages. Another milestone: Sotheby's auction salon in New York is selling the collection of James C. Copeland, a California sporting goods retailer, March 22. Among the goodies: a rare Honus Wagner tobacco card that could bring $ 150,000, and a collection of 160 World Series press pins that could fetch $ 300,000. ... Score Inc. has created a ''hobby advisory board'' to learn how it can best serve dealers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> SHELL GAME: Next trip to the ballpark, tip your hat to the MVP - the Master Vendor of Peanuts, that is. Peanuts have been a big part of baseball for more than 100 years, according to the National Peanut Month Committee. More than $ 10 million is shelled out for peanuts at ballparks every year. The MVPs will be named in March and the lucky vendors will get a trophy, a button and a free trip to spring training in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. ran into trouble Monday, when the Beaverton, Ore.- based athletic-shoe maker reported weaker-than-expected earnings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock sank 2 1/2 to $ 47 1/2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's largest maker of athletic shoes reported earnings of 93 cents per share for the quarter ending Feb. 28 - a 12% jump from 83 cents. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn about 97 cents. ''The results were a little disappointing,'' says Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. ''It appears that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is losing momentum.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company cited higher expenses related to the introduction of new products such as the Air 180 running shoe. Expenses rose to 22.7% of revenue from 19.9%. Revenue in the period rose 39% to $ 802 million. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it plans to continue its ''aggressive'' marketing campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inventories rose 121% in the period, suggesting sales are slowing dramatically, notes Mike Shea, analyst at Black &amp; Co. Overall orders rose 12%, led by apparel (up 17%) and overseas footwear (up 43%). But domestic shoe orders, which account for more than 60% of sales, were flat. ''That's a red flag,'' Shea says, adding that he recommends selling the stock if you own it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the nation's No. 3 athletic-shoe maker, L.A. Gear, had better news. It restructured loan agreements with major lenders. L.A. Gear shares rose 1 to $ 13 1/2. Last month, the Los Angeles-based athletic-shoe maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 35 cents a share, vs. net income of 58 cents the year before.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Thumbs down: Warner-Lambert Inc. shares dipped 1 7/8 to $ 72 1/2 after its Alzheimer's drug, Cognex, failed to win approval from a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee. The FDA said the drug was no more effective than a sugar pill. Alex. Brown &amp; Co. lowered its rating to a sell from neutral. Shearson Lehman Bros. lowered its rating to underperform from outperform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The drug was highly touted and an important and major factor in many people's thinking about the fundamental outlook for Warner-Lambert,'' says Alex. Brown analyst Richard Stover. Analysts project that Cognex, if approved, would eventually generate more than $ 500 million in yearly revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company officials and some analysts insist the drug will get FDA approval by 1993.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indianapolis, home of the world's most famous auto race, has a new claim to fame: the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.B.C.D. (Academic Betterment and Career Development) basketball camp, the USA's preeminent proving ground for high school stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentlemen, start your sneakers. The camp opens Friday and runs until the checkered flag drops Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved the camp when it became apparent it had outgrown Princeton University, its home since 1983. With its basketball pedigree, Indianapolis was an easy choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis campus is adjacent to the National Institute for Fitness and Sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 120 players are invited, at a cost to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of nearly $ 100,000. The roster reads like a who's who in high school basketball. Here's who Hoop Scoop magazine is listing as some of the top players to watch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Best player: California player of the year Jason Kidd, a 6-4 guard who averaged 25 points and 10 rebounds last season for Alameda St. Joseph Notre Dame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Best big man: Mississippi player of the year Othello Harrington, a 6-9 center who averaged 29 points and 19 rebounds for Jackson Murrah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Best junior: A toss-up between 7-foot Rashard Griffith of Chicago King and 6-10 Rasheed Wallace of Philadelphia Simon Gratz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every major-college coach will be watching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camp academic director Frank DuBois says players spend only 40 minutes a day on basketball and about five hours on academics. After all, this is the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Academic Betterment and Career Development camp. ''We want these kids to know that there's more to life than basketball,'' DuBois says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> REINSTATED: Dennis Holthaus, the Cincinnati Aiken football coach fired last year for making a racial remark to black members of his team, must be reinstated and given back pay. Hamilton County (Ohio) Common Pleas Judge Norman Murdock said the Cincinnati Board of Education acted illegally in firing Holthaus, currently an assistant at Aiken.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> REMATCH: Jasper (Texas) sprinter Bryan Bronson, Gatorade Circle of Champions Athlete of the Year, renews his rivalry with Wendell Gaskin of Kansas City (Kan.) Washington this weekend at Spokane, Wash. Gaskin beat Bronson in the 100 and 200 meters two weeks ago at the U.S. Junior Championships.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like other companies, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. has had some problems during the recession. But the nation's leading maker of athletic shoes appears to be landing on its feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which makes Air Jordan and other high-priced sports shoes, is expected to report results today for its fiscal year ended May 31. Tuesday, the company said it was comfortable with Wall Street estimates of $ 3.65 to $ 3.85 a share, vs. $ 3.21 last year. The stock jumped 2 3/8 to $ 41 1/4.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think there'll be any surprises,'' says Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson . ''It's been able to hold its own in a difficult environment while others fade away.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said earlier that 1991 revenue had topped $ 3 billion - 36% higher than its $ 2.2 billion in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faces challenges in 1992 because of increased competition and a growing trend away from expensive athletic shoes. Some analysts predict revenue growth will slow to 17%. Jacobson says he's looking for only 9% earnings growth to $ 4.15 a share - not the big double-digit growth investors saw in previous years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Jacobson and First Albany analyst Todd Berko say the company has bright prospects ahead internationally, where trends lag three years behind the USA. ''It's an incredibly well-managed company that's had an incredible string of successes the past few years,'' Berko says. ''The product development is still the strongest in the industry and they're still committing money to advertising.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Valuable assets? Shares of Craig Corp. have been roaring higher since BusinessWeek reported Monday that some investors believe Craig is greatly undervalued. But at least one analyst takes exception to the article and recommends selling the Los Angeles-based real-estate and supermarket company. Craig shares, up 2 3/8 Monday, rose another 2 1/8 to $ 20 5/8 Tuesday - a 28% gain in two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BusinessWeek, citing unnamed money managers, said Craig's 50% stake in Stater Bros., a private California supermarket chain, and stakes in financial services company Citadel Holding and real-estate manager Reading Co. make Craig's assets worth about $ 30 a share. But H.D. Brous &amp; Co. analyst Howard Rosencrans, one of the few analysts to follow the company, says the stock is fully valued at $ 15. He urges his clients to sell. He says 1991 sales slowed at Stater Bros. He says defense cuts and the poor real-estate market is hurting Craig's other interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes after his team had easily dispatched Virginia Tech in December of 1989, John Thompson walked into an interview room at Capital Centre for his postgame comments. As he sat down, he heard a security guard out in the hallway carrying on a conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill, Bill,&quot; Thompson said, turning angrily toward the school's sports information director, Bill Shapland. And then he began to shout, &quot;I need someone to tell those people to shut up out there. Right now, tell them to shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moment later, Thompson turned back toward the assembled press corps and calmly dissected the basketball game, laughing and joking about an easy win, the play of his new point guard, David Edwards, and how impressed he'd been by Virginia Tech's Bimbo Coles, one of his former Olympians, whom he now praised as &quot;the best guard in America.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden flash of fury, followed so quickly by this placid, good-humored dissertation, seemed so odd, and somewhat unnerving to anyone who saw it. Yet his friends will tell you that was typical of the John Thompson they have come to know. Many of those same people will also admit they don't really know him at all. They have an idea, a theory, an opinion, on what makes the man, what drives the man, but that's all. He's a very simple guy, says one friend. He's a very complex person, says another. Just when you think he's taking the money and running to the Denver Nuggets, he decides to stay at Georgetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been that way all of his life, and John Thompson can also tell you what he is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not Saint John,&quot; he once said. &quot;I do not go to confession seven days a week. I am not a father figure to my players. They all have parents, mothers and fathers, and I think you insult those people when you call me a father image to their sons. It is not my intention to be a crusader for this cause or that cause. I don't want to be a social worker. Let's take this education thing. They all say, 'Thompson is wonderful because he stresses education, education, education.' Well, they hired me to coach basketball. If I say I want my kids to get an education, it's perceived as an extraordinary thing, that I'm a martyr or something. Why should that be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Usually, there is a good guy or a bad guy. I'm not interested in being the bad guy. Who is? But I don't know if I'm the good guy either. I make mistakes. I get angry. Sometimes I work the kids too hard. I'm like any other coach -- I'd love to have them concentrate on basketball. I have people on my staff who help me control those feelings. I need that check. I am not trying to be anything other than what I am, and I'm really not certain what that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not exactly certain what that is either, but I've got a few opinions on some of the fundamental questions people have been asking me about John Thompson ever since I first met the man 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is John Thompson a racist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not believe he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many are convinced otherwise. They insist he fields a mostly black team because he has an innate distrust of whites going all the way back to his childhood. And yet the record indicates otherwise. If the measure of a man is taken by the company he keeps, consider the following: His two most trusted aides over the last 18 years have been whites -- Mary Fenlon and Bill Stein. His chief recruiter, Craig Esherick, is white. So are Georgetown's longtime head trainer, Lorry Michel; the team physician since 1974, Carl MacCartee; the radio play-by-play announcer from day one, Rich Chvotkin, and the longtime sports information director, Bill Shapland. His most loyal supporters on campus for most of his tenure -- Father Timothy Healy, the former school president; Frank Rienzo, the athletic director; and Charles Deacon, the director of admissions -- are white. Two of his closest advisers over the years -- Dave Gavitt and Red Auerbach -- are white. So are his agents -- Donald Dell and David Falk -- not to mention his good friend Dan Rather, a loyal supporter of the program who calls more than occasionally. And when Thompson was leaning toward accepting the Denver job, it was Esherick he was pushing as his replacement, not Mike Riley, a black assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He obviously cares very deeply about issues affecting minorities. His stands on Propositions 48 and 42 are testament to that. He also tells his players there is one virtually certain way to overcome racism and escape the inner city: money. But John Thompson a racist? Emphatically no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he's not a racist, why are white players so few and far between on his teams?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same question could also be asked of most of America's major college basketball coaches. Heading into the 1990s, more than 70 percent of the players on major college basketball teams are black, and the percentage is growing each year. The talent pool of white players physically gifted enough to play at the highest level of the sport is rather thin, and competition for the best players is fierce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Thompson's defense, many white players would prefer to go elsewhere and not play for a demanding black coach, though it must also be said that he has not gone out of his way to recruit white athletes. Danny Ferry (Duke all-America two years ago) grew up in his own backyard, but Thompson never made an attempt to talk to him. He should have. Still, in recent years Thompson hasn't been doing much recruiting anyway, of white or black players. He hates the process, finds it demeaning. But he does not dislike white ball players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is he a bully?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times he can be. He is an intimidating presence, a 6-foot-10, 270-pound bundle of potentially belligerent rage and retribution who has also learned over the years how to use his size and his bellowing baritone voice to his full advantage. It is not a pretty sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his own Big East Conference, Thompson has feuded with fellow coaches Jim Boeheim (Syracuse), Rick Pitino (formerly of Providence) and Paul Evans (Pittsburgh), though all three insist they no longer have a problem with the head Hoya. His disdain for Brent Musburger has been well documented. He also tried to bully another old colleague, Bill Raftery of CBS, when the former Seton Hall coach criticized his team's roughhouse style during a game against Pittsburgh in 1987 that degenerated into a brawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can John Thompson coach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No question here. His record speaks for itself -- 423 wins going into this season, a national championship, three Final Four appearances, four Big East Conference regular season titles, 14 times in the NCAA tournament, including 12 straight, 16 consecutive postseason appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His teams are disciplined, incredibly conditioned and thoroughly relentless, particularly on defense, where Thompson truly excels. The Hoyas have never been a sophisticated offensive team, and only when Patrick Ewing left the program and turned professional did he become a major scoring force. The same may also hold true for the team's current star, Alonzo Mourning, who has struggled adjusting to Thompson's offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson was not a great offensive player, and he is not a gifted offensive coach. But he does get results. Mitch Kupchak, the assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Lakers, also points out that very few of the 18 players drafted by the NBA from Thompson's teams have been stars in the professional ranks. Ewing is an all-star for the New York Knicks. Sleepy Floyd is a solid pro for Houston. But many of Thompson's best players -- Craig Shelton, John Duren, Bill Martin, David Wingate, Reggie Williams, Charles Smith -- have struggled in the NBA. Kupchak believes it's a testament to Thompson's ability that he can keep his teams at the highest levels of the game without the best athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's pursuit of the dollar has been almost as intense as his quest for a national championship. Money makes men free, Thompson is fond of saying, and it also allows him to have the kind of control he covets -- complete, absolute authority to do it his way, just as Auerbach and Bill Russell taught him so many years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson believes money is the root of all power. &quot;I think more change has come about because of economics, because people totally disregard color barriers if you have economic value,&quot; he has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In America in 1990, it's hard to argue that philosophy with a man who pulled himself all the way up from poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some rivals believe Thompson has a competitive advantage recruiting players because of his ties to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a $ 200,000 a year endorsement contract with the company. Mourning is the primary case in point. Thompson first met him on campus at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-sponsored tournament. Mourning's high school team wore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products. He attended a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-sponsored summer camp, where his high school coach was a paid counselor there for two years. The summer league Mourning played in used sneakers supplied by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and specifically by Sonny Vaccaro, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive who is also a good friend of Thompson's. Thompson, Vaccaro and Mourning have all previously denied that Thompson's business connection with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and friendship with Vaccaro had anything to do with Mourning going to Georgetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is growing concern among college athletic officials -- and even among coaches themselves -- that shoe companies are influencing the recruiting process by offering free shoes, equipment and stipends to high school coaches, who then may steer top prospects toward college coaches affiliated with those very same shoe companies. Because of such concerns, the NCAA says it will soon be looking into the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those who believe that college coaches under contracts to shoe companies should give back part of their earnings to their schools, perhaps even sharing endorsement money (in the form of a stipend) with their players who wear the shoes. Dean Smith has been an advocate of sharing the wealth, but that is now prohibited by the NCAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson sees nothing wrong with the big money paid to coaches by the shoe companies, and finds it ironic that he's being criticized at a time when so few high-profile black athletes or coaches receive endorsement deals. He also says shoe contracts allow many smaller schools to keep high-profile coaches from moving to bigger institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would P. J. Carlesimo have stayed at Seton Hall [without his shoe money]?&quot; Thompson said in a previous interview. &quot;No. Would John Thompson have stayed at Georgetown? No. Would Rollie Massimino have stayed at Villanova? No. In a competitive marketplace, the big state schools, particularly in the West, could have recruited the coaches with their big-time boosters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is John Thompson loyal to his former players and coaches?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Thompson's players, particularly from his pre-Ewing days, are extremely bitter and haven't spoken to him in years. His first three big-name signings from his own high school team -- Greg Brooks, Jonathan Smith and Merlin Wilson -- want nothing to do with the program, mostly because they believe Thompson lost interest in them once they stopped playing and left school. And yet their teammate Aaron Long, a seldom-used reserve, to this day remains a close Thompson confidant and speaks in glowing terms of his old coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's relationship with his stars is somewhat intriguing -- and inconsistent -- as well. Patrick Ewing is still very much a presence in the program. Thompson speaks with him often, uses him to help recruit and gives him carte blanche to use Georgetown's facilities in the offseason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sleepy Floyd, Thompson's first all-American, says he's lost touch with his old coach, for no particular reason other than the fact that he plays ball in Houston and was never that close to him to begin with. Similarly, Reggie Williams, Thompson's last all-American, hasn't had any contact with the program virtually since the day he graduated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson can hardly be expected to have close relationships with every athlete who came through the program, but several former players (especially Craig Shelton) have complained that Thompson, in addition to being inaccessible, has done virtually nothing to show his appreciation for their past contributions. Many schools, for example, bring back players from the past for special halftime or pregame ceremonies. Not Georgetown. &quot;It's like we were never there,&quot; said one former player. &quot;They don't even invite me to the team banquet, and I live 10 minutes from campus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's relationship with many of his old friends has also been inconsistent. While people like Fenlon, Stein, Auerbach and Gavitt have been constants in his life for years, many others who played significant roles in his success have fallen by the wayside. Jim Wiggins, the barber who was Thompson's closest confidant in the early years, is now a bitter enemy. Ron Watts, his pal from the Celtic days and the man he named his son after, hardly ever talks to Thompson. Bob Dwyer, his old high school coach, desperately wants to make peace with Thompson, but Thompson won't even return his telephone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has Georgetown sold out to big-time college sports?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course it has, just as any school that maintains a high-profile, nationally ranked athletic program sells out, despite all the pious pronouncements to the contrary. As Murray Sperber wrote in College Sports Inc.: &quot;Athletes are the only group of students recruited for entertainment -- not academic -- purposes, and they are the only students who go through school on grants based not on educational aptitude, but on their talent and potential as commercial entertainers. If colleges searched for and gave scholarships to up-and-coming rock stars so that they could entertain the university community and earn money for their schools through concerts and tours, educational authorities and the public would call this 'a perversion of academic values.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgetown's decision to allow marginal students into its program is a sellout as well. But what can we say about other sports at top &quot;sports colleges&quot; in America? Clearly Michael Graham had no business at Georgetown. Neither did John Turner. Professors who have these and other students in their classes can only shrug their shoulders. One psychology professor told me that he learned a long time ago it would be wise to simply accept the fact that some athletes did not belong in his class, and do the best he could to get them through. It's the price you pay for a Top 20 basketball team. And the evidence suggests that Thompson's record is better -- far better -- than the records of most other coaches in big-time college sports in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no question that Thompson has been a godsend for Georgetown. His basketball program funds most of the school's athletic programs, and helps balance the department's budget. A good portion of the money earned from NCAA appearances goes into the school's scholarship fund and some also is used to improve athletic facilities. With NCAA Final Four teams scheduled to earn $ 3 million in 1991, that contribution to university coffers has the potential to be staggering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, his teams' constant success over the years has increased the school's national visibility and fueled intense interest in the university, particularly among minority applicants. Last year alone, the school had more than 1,000 applications from black students around the country. When Thompson took over the program, there were fewer than 100 black applicants a year. Similarly, the number of total applicants also has risen dramatically over the years, and school officials say the basketball team's rise to prominence in the national polls has played a significant role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A successful athletic team also helps draw a college community together. It becomes a rallying point for students, faculty and far-flung alumni, particularly when the team does well. Father Timothy Healy, the school's former president, spoke frequently about the &quot;great pride and joy&quot; the basketball team provided the Georgetown community -- how successful teams were also part of the educational process, giving students an outlet to vent their emotions and blow off steam after a tough day in the classroom and the library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Thompson works long, hard hours and expects the same from everyone around him. Accept it or leave. That's how he runs his life, that's how he runs his program. He makes no promises to his players. He sets down the rules and expects them to be followed. Coats and ties on the road. Freshmen carry the basketballs. You will sign John's (class attendance) book or face the consequences. Miss a class, don't bother to practice. Miss a bunch of classes, don't bother to come back at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secrecy, the security, the paranoia are also part of the package. So are Thompson's pursuit of the dollar, his silly little fusses and feuds with so many people, his almost fiendish fetish for the privacy of his family and his team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the system works for Georgetown, and especially for John Thompson. He wins basketball games, and does it within the rules. He makes a ton of money for his school, and has given Georgetown more exposure than anyone thought possible when he was first hired in 1972. Almost all of his players graduate and go on to productive lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But John Thompson's own life has been the greatest success story of them all: He began his life as a poor youngster from the inner city who rose above poverty and prejudice to reach the very top of his highly visible profession, earning a small fortune along the way and becoming a widely respected spokesman for his school, his sport, and his people, just as Anna Thompson always told him he could.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: A woman alone. Beautiful, determined, young. With a perfectly timed leap, her running shoes kicked behind her, she is centred within the parabola of the skip rope. Deep within, she hears the voice: &quot;You became significant . . . to yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: The runner's balance is like a cat's. In an impromptu ballet on steel, he races over the girders of an unfinished skyscraper . . . and escapes. He has &quot;the edge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: An eerie underworld. A dark medieval keeper feeds strange substances to a mysterious row of cone-shaped pupae. Suddenly, one begins to shake. Sounds intensify, viscera shred. In a moment of frightening birth, out of the dank cavity steps . . . a human foot . . . it is electric with color . . . it is wearing . . . a running shoe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the answer - the running shoe. The sneaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these advertisements, it takes only a glimpse of the brand to remind us which particular pair promises . . . what? Freedom? Perfection? Power? The only thing that can stop the dream is you. Come on. Get into a pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just do it. Pump it. Air it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, most of us have felt the pull of these ads. They're among hundreds of pitches for running shoes. And they're the work of some of the best creative minds. (The shivering pupae come courtesy of Canada's master director, David Cronenberg, and the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air 180). That kind of image-making talent is drawn by success. And there are few products in our time that rival the runaway success of the shoes we used to call &quot;runners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're &quot;sports shoes&quot; now, or &quot;athletic shoes&quot;. They're flashy, high-tech, stupendously colorful, and sheer energy on your feet. They come in hundreds of styles and we buy millions of pairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada this year that will add up to $1 billion. The Americans have passed $10 billion. And experts will tell you that 80 per cent of them are sold to people who do no regular exercise at all. It isn't just jocks, it's an entire culture that's buying into the image (or images) of the athletic shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the intense, competitive, and volatile sports shoe industry is pulling out all the marketing stops. Saying it with sneakers has become part of the way our culture expresses itself. Dig Run D.M.C.: &quot;We make a mean team / My adidas and me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Athletic shoes,&quot; says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> design director Tinker Hatfield, &quot;are as much a statement about your personality as clothing or cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cars are what they sound most like. What can I show you? A Brooks Chariot? A New Balance 677? How about a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Trainer TW 1990? Or a Reebok AXT Hexalite Pump? Okay, just for you, a K Swiss Gstaad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sport shoe language is physical, aggressive, exciting. And the sales pitch comes from some very big stars. From Michael Jordan, the limping Bo Jackson, Andre Agassi, John McEnroe (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There's sweet Stefan Edberg, or cool Yvan Lendl (adidas). For Reebok there's Isiah Thomas or Michael Chang. And how about this lineup for L.A. Gear: Joe &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; Montana, Paula &quot;Everybody's Sweetheart&quot; Abdul. (Soon to be joined by those noted jocks, Heather Locklear and Priscilla Presley. Gear's contract with Michael Jackson is being disputed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened? How did the dowdy home of the Odor Eater and the droopy gym sock become show business? How did it become the gleaming billion dollar marvel we see today? How did every third shoe sold become a sports shoe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is partly the product itself. It has come a long, long way. But it has also been carried forward by some of the immense social forces of our time, forces that began to gather just after World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first rubber-soled canvas shoe actually goes way back to 1868. And on a royal visit in 1919, the then-beloved Prince of Wales had actually started a brief craze for a sports shoe with &quot;style&quot; when he wore his white canvas plimsolls to play tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real story begins with the post-war kids in the '50's. They were vast in number, liked having things of their own, and they started to develop a special attachment to what Canadian kids called &quot;running shoes.&quot; (&quot;Sneakers&quot; was the Americanism.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared to the high-tech wonders of today, they were a primitive piece of goods - and pretty plain. Just black high cuts at first, though white runners, colors, and low cuts followed as the '60s dawned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when you gave them a pounding, they looked it. The canvas frayed, your big toe wore through, the rubber pieces came unglued and ripped off, they didn't smell very nice and suddenly the fun . . . wasn't there anymore. What was formerly funky was now just a beaten looking thing. And your mother would definitely not let you wear them to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, they could be pretty cool when they were broken in just right. And those Keds and P.F. Flyers looked great with jeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the footwear market, things started to change. Sneakers went from 5 per cent of the market in 1950, to 10 per cent in 1957, to 20 in 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leather shoemakers tried to fight back. They planted stories in the teen magazines saying a fad was ending (&quot;TEENS SHED SNEAKERS&quot;). They found podiatrists who claimed, &quot;SNEAKERS BAD FOR GROWING FEET&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't work. Sports shoes had had arch and heel supports since the '30s. That rubber sole would come a long way later, but it was basically fine. The kids' feet were all right and they wore their sneakers more and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they wore were a few classic styles - deck shoe, basketball high top, all-purpose runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But elsewhere in the world were forces that would change things. New attention was being paid to engineering and design in both Japan (Tiger shoes) and Germany (Puma, adidas).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German shoes were actually the creations of rival brothers, Rudi (Puma) and Adi (adidas) Dassler who had quarrelled, broken up a 23-year-old family business, and vowed never to speak again. They competed in every way, including in a field Rudi pioneered - paying athletes for wearing your brand of shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, shoe reps ran wild. Athletes reaped an instant cash harvest, and all over the world a recognition dawned - with trademark logos, sports shoes had become prime advertising space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon we were treated to the spectacle of gold medalists holding their sneakers aloft - not their national flag. An anonymous product was starting to hit the big time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, for the post-war kids, there was a whole range of new international brands to buy. And they were better, stronger shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kids became adults, but they decided sneakers were one of the things they wouldn't let go. Part of it was staying young, and part of it was defying mom. It was a countercultural statement to wear the &quot;unacceptable&quot; shoe anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special attention had to be paid to the newest craze of the baby boom age - jogging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a way to hold on to your youth. Suddenly the streets were filled with people in flight - racing from the spectre of middle age. And they were hurting themselves doing it - until gradually better arch and heel support, new style toe boxes, fast-gripping soles, and shock absorbing mid-soles, made running on the merciless pavement possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America staged a comeback in sneaker sales. It was lead by former University of Oregon track coach, Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, a former Oregon middle distance runner turned MBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After both worked with the Tiger company of Japan on making and selling better sports shoes, Bowerman made his now famous breakthrough. Pouring rubber into his waffle iron at home, he discovered the lightweight/strong grip &quot;waffle sole&quot; that took the running world by storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They set up shop in Beaverton, Ore. and named their company after the Greek goddess of victory - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the '70s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was America's leading brand. But all the brands seemed to be selling more and more pairs of athletic shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1980, a transit strike in New York sent thousands of people out in the street, and they began to wear sneakers to walk to work. It was an inspired choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women especially loved them. Wearing sneakers with your business suit was a sign you had moxie, that you'd no longer put up with the punishment of high heels for the sake of fashion or male approval. Women everywhere took note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What also converted millions of women to sports shoes was a new sport that seemed just right for them. Aerobics looked disco-driven and faddish to begin with, but it really was an inspired mix of calisthenics and dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it was a tough workout that required a special kind of shoe. A British company took a gamble and designed and produced one that aerobicizers loved. The shoe made a household word out of Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of the converted was lengthening all the time. Among the baby boomers were those who were seriously into exercising, and those who wanted to practice what Tom Wolfe called &quot;young fit and firm chic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing up the rear were the rest, like me, who hadn't realized what they were missing. When I finally got around to trying a new, scientifically designed shoe - lightweight, with reinforced everything and a multi-layered sole - I was stunned. Nothing had ever felt so good on my feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for the old kids. In the '80s it was really the new kids who put the sports shoe industry into the billion dollar stratosphere. Far from the yupscale world of the thirtysomethings, sneakers became a passion for teenagers on the paved-over, graffiti-filled playgrounds of the American inner city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were part of the dress uniform of cool, must haves for young urban warrior. In Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, the movie's tone of high-tension about to explode is quickly created when a ghetto dweller's new sneakers are scuffed by a passerby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In TV commercials, it was emulation of the great new basketball stars, flying wonders like Julius Erving, &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, and Michael &quot;Air&quot; Jordan - men the sports shoe companies were making into megastars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then sneakers became part of new street music - rap. A style had been set that would reach teenagers everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New padded high tops, colored leather uppers, neon stripes and accents, wave after wave of new brands, and millions of dollars in marketing - it was making the ever-hip sports shoe all but irresistible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it wasn't all good news. The shoes broke the hundred dollar barrier and kept climbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the joy they brought to teenagers who could manage to afford a pair, there was the pain for those who couldn't buy in. At times it turned ugly. &quot;Boy Stabbed For Sneakers&quot; sounds like an urban myth. Police officers in a lot of cities, including Toronto, know it's not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does it end? Where does the craving for sports shoes stop?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people think it won't. Partly, it's because there are now so many brands to choose from, and their ever-new technologically dazzling models are marketed so well. And partly, it's because they really do deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The baby boom generation has had it with traditional leather shoes,&quot; says podiatrist and author ( The Foot Book) Dr. Glen Copeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future may be compromise. The halls and boardrooms where sneakers still fear to tread are now seeing the walking shoe - a traditional leather upper on an athletic style sole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been magic born out of the old love affair between kids and their running shoes. It's become the golden age of the rubber sole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCENE: The superstar has returned to the playground. The camera catches him - alone, dazzling against a twilight sky. In full flight above the city, above the earth. A four-pointed star with basketball. The earth, the hoop below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: A woman alone. Beautiful, determined, young. With a perfectly timed leap, her running shoes kicked behind her, she is centred within the parabola of the skip rope. Deep within, she hears the voice: &quot;You became significant . . . to yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: The runner's balance is like a cat's. In an impromptu ballet on steel, he races over the girders of an unfinished skyscraper . . . and escapes. He has &quot;the edge.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scene: An eerie underworld. A dark medieval keeper feeds strange substances to a mysterious row of cone-shaped pupae. Suddenly, one begins to shake. Sounds intensify, viscera shred. In a moment of frightening birth, out of the dank cavity steps . . . a human foot . . . it is electric with color . . . it is wearing . . . a running shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the answer - the running shoe. The sneaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these advertisements, it takes only a glimpse of the brand to remind us which particular pair promises . . . what? Freedom? Perfection? Power? The only thing that can stop the dream is you. Come on. Get into a pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just do it. Pump it. Air it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, most of us have felt the pull of these ads. They're among hundreds of pitches for running shoes. And they're the work of some of the best creative minds. (The shivering pupae come courtesy of Canada's master director, David Cronenberg, and the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air 180). That kind of image-making talent is drawn by success. And there are few products in our time that rival the runaway success of the shoes we used to call &quot;runners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're &quot;sports shoes&quot; now, or &quot;athletic shoes&quot;. They're flashy, high-tech, stupendously colorful, and sheer energy on your feet. They come in hundreds of styles and we buy millions of pairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada this year that will add up to $ 1 billion. The Americans have passed $ 10 billion. And experts will tell you that 80 per cent of them are sold to people who do no regular exercise at all. It isn't just jocks, it's an entire culture that's buying into the image (or images) of the athletic shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the intense, competitive, and volatile sports shoe industry is pulling out all the marketing stops. Saying it with sneakers has become part of the way our culture expresses itself. Dig Run D.M.C.: &quot;We make a mean team / My adidas and me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Athletic shoes,&quot; says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> design director Tinker Hatfield, &quot;are as much a statement about your personality as clothing or cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON - A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers. He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of &quot;sky surfing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing. The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short. Play Hard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the Number 2 spot and overtake its rival, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sky surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that made its debut on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York. The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology. The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that for a variety of reasons fell short of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ubiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon. As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on. Reebok also last year was caught in a controversy over a campaign that depicted &quot;bunjee jumping,&quot; an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges or other high objects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Reebok has been labelled a &quot;revolving door&quot; client by ad agencies. The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bunjee jumping ad. Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last long, either, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day. Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past. But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reebok has been like a teenager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign. &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things. Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and advertising executives say it will be months before there are clear signs whether the campaign will create a new high-water mark for athletic shoe ads. But most reacted positively to Reebok's approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen the line and I like it. In the context of sports and of trying to have the maximum performance, I think it works,&quot; said Joe Grimaldi, chief operating officer of Mullen Advertising Inc. of Wenham, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several wondered privately whether Reebok's new theme is more attuned to the go-go 1980s than the presumably more laid-back '90s. But the consensus was that it would appeal to the active and would-be athletes Reebok is trying to reach, especially if the company doesn't put the campaign on the shelf too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't be too literal about the line. It could do for them what 'Just Do It' does for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a call to action, an invitation to get out there and play some sports,&quot; said Ron Lawner, chairman and creative director at the Lawner Reingold Britton agency in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems they are introducing a campaign idea that they are going to stay with, and I think that's even more important than the campaign itself,&quot; said Steve Encarnacao, Reebok's chief marketing officer from 1985-87 and now chief executive of Stonemark Inc., which produces Carter's children shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encarnacao suggested the new campaign harks back to an early, successful effort by Rebok, titled &quot;... Because Life Is Not a Spectator Sport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ropes said the ads will be backed by a $20 million campaign that will stress television but also will include print and outdoor advertising. The heaviest exposure will be during back-to-school buying sprees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the campaign works, stock analysts expect it to move Reebok closer to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the $5.6 billion athletic shoe market. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year controlled 27 per cent to Reebok's 22 per cent of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok has been demonstrating strong financial performance in the midst of a recession. Second-quarter earnings were better than expected, rising 39 per cent to $60.3 million, or 64 cents a share, from $43.3 million, or 38 cents, in the year-earlier period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales for the quarter, boosted by the success of the Pump line of shoes, rose 30 per cent to $688 million, from $527 million in the same period of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cost-cutting efforts also impressed analysts, several of whom noted that Fireman's pay cut saved the company $2 million in the second-quarter alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok also is expected to benefit from the corporate implosion of L.A. Gear Inc., a competitive upstart that recently announced it has entered an agreement with its bankers to avoid loan foreclosures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE sporting-goods industry did its best last week to ignore the recession. The 85,000 sports aficionados who gathered here for the industry's largest annual trade exhibit -- the Super Show -- whet their appetites on a menu of new technology sauteed in marketing hype.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 1.6 million square feet of floor space and 6,000 booths at four sites in the downtown area, mostly at the Georgia World Congress Center, manufacturers unveiled exercise machines that talk back, tennis racquets that sound heavy but feel light, shoes that spring off their heels, bicycles that jump curbs and clothes that breathe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swarms of buyers for stores perused the show in search of items that would sell in a flat retail market. Although the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, which stages the show, projected a 6 percent growth in the industry's wholesale volume, from $30.8 billion in 1990 to $32.7 billion in 1991, the number fell short of the double-digit expansion the industry had come to expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But insiders were buoyed by the recession-resistant nature of the industry. &quot;Sports have become a solid part of the modern-life style, and, therefore, sporting-goods sales are less negatively affected in recessionary times,&quot; said John D. Riddle, association president.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>An Overview<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lured by dazzling product displays, visitors to the show faced a marketing barrage. From Joe Montana to Greg Norman, sports celebritries appeared as if they were hors d'oeuvres in a dinner of corporate steaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the athletic-footwear manufacturer, spent $4 million on its booth. The 61,000-square-foot area featured </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> newest shoes under robotic lights on center stage. Reebok, dominated a $1 million space not far down the concourse where aerobic dance skits, loud rock music and intermittent celebrity autograph signings set a frenetic pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower-profile exhibitors staffed booths strung out with wares like an exotic marketplace. Despite the enticements, most dealers seemed cautious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to watch our spending,&quot; said Brad Henry, a buyer for Valley Sports of Fresno, Calif. &quot;We're not going to tie up our dollars far in advance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood translated into a search for trends: something, anything to make the public buy, buy, buy. Here are a few trends to watch for in your sport and equipment of choice.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Tennis<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widebody racquets are still the industry favorites. But the new watchwords of the 46 racquet manufacturers at the show are &quot;lighter&quot; and &quot;more flexible.&quot; First introduced by Wilson Sporting Goods in 1987, the widebody racquet was made to be stiff and powerful. Today's versions are designed to put feel back in the racquet and dampen shock. Racquets are lighter than ever: the 10-ounce barrier has been broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are taking the fat out,&quot; said Tracy Leonard, equipment adviser for Tennis magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finding ingenious ways to do it, too. Head's Genesis racquet, for instance, is thinner in the cross sections. The Hammer, Wilson's newest high-end widebody, has taken about two ounces out of the handle, but kept the same weight in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince introduced the Vortex widebody racquet at the show, its light weight achieved with materials adopted from the aerospace industry: viscoelastic polymer, a thermoplastic material, and continuous strands of carbon fiber. The strings are staggered along the frame, an innovation designed to absorb more impact from the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunlop attacked the widebody's shock-absorption problem in a different way. With its new Revelation racquet, introduced last month and on display at the show, the company added vibration-dampening rods to the handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-end racquets are closing in on $300. But the new technology is filtering down to mid-priced racquets, too.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Footwear<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leading footwear manufacturers set the tone of the show with fancy video displays and Hollywood floor shows. But even more impressive was their sheer numbers: more than 160 exhibitors of everything from basketball shoes to sandals were on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than L.A. Gear, which has produced the Catapult, a basketball shoe with a heel spring, most innovations are directed at weight savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The challenge is in finding a balance between light, and making a shoe with cushioning, stability and support,&quot; said Bill Dragon, president of Avia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New materials, like thermoplastics, carbon fiber and foams, are replacing standard materials. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken the heel counter out of its new Haurache running shoe and replaced it with a molded rubber heel strap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And making it clear that they intend to follow their customers from the basketball and tennis courts to the trails of the backwoods, the leading manufacturers showed new lines of shoes and clothing for hiking, camping and mountain biking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who were exposed to running in the 1980's while they were single are looking for activities they can do with their families in the 1990's,&quot; said Tom Clarke, director of marketing for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Fitness<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weight machines, popular in the 1970's, are making a comeback for the home, said Richard Miller, a buyer for The Gym Source, a New York City equipment distributor. &quot;Home use is the future,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies like Pacific Fitness are making compact home-gym units that allow for 100 different exercises at a price of $1,600 to $2,400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSA Inc., a fitness-products manufacturer from South Easton, Mass., introduced 23 new exercise machines at the show, including several versions of computerized talking machines that it began marketing last year. The units are designed to verbally coach users, and to store previous workouts so they can be recalled for comparison to a new routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bike machines still appear to be more popular than treadmills and stairsteppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional companies are diversifying. Life Fitness, the company that spearheaded the stationary-bike movement, has designed a new stair machine this year, Lifestep 5500, available this summer for $1,295.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bicycling<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although bicycling is a fast-growing sport with a propensity for dramatic innovation, only 19 bicycle manufacturers showed up in Atlanta. A recent study by Bicycling magazine counted 32 million cyclists in the United States. In recognition of this popularity, the Super Show opened its doors for a cycle show for the first time. Although few of the leading manufacturers attended, signs of trends surfaced, most noticeably in the cross bike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a hybrid of road and mountain bikes, the cross bike has thinner tires than a mountain bike. It has a more central shifting system, and a sloping top tube. &quot;People are finding that the mountain bike is too much bike,&quot; said Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling. &quot;The cross bike is a bike that people can ride for commuting or in-town use.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Apparel<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neon is out and deeper, richer tones and earth colors are in, reflecting a pervasive embrace of the outdoors. Moreover, companies like Du Pont, Hind and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who make their own fabrics, are finding that function is blurring with fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This crossover isn't necessarily a permanent thing because of the fickleness of ready-to-wear,&quot; said Jennifer Lisle, fabrics editor at Sport Style, a biweekly sports publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Function, however, still dominates. Lynn Hill, the top United States women's rock climber, and Katarina Witt, the German Olympic skater, attended the Super Show on behalf of Du Pont and Hind. Hill scaled artificial walls to demonstrate how athletic tights &quot;allow you to move with your sport.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has employed an all- star roster of male athletes, including Bo Jackson and Michael Jordan, to lure men to its lines of athletic footwear. But what about women, who accounted for roughly 42 percent of all athletic shoes purchased in 1990?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel our advertising has to be different for women,&quot; said Lisa DeNeffe, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman. &quot;Women look up to other women, but they don't really have specific role models as much as men do. So we took a different approach.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That approach is illustrated in an eight-page insert that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its advertising agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, began placing in women's magazines earlier this month. Instead of sports stars, the ad relies on simple sentences in large black type that chronicle the stages in a woman's life from childhood to adulthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You wanted to be a veterinarian,&quot; the ad states in a section devoted to childhood. &quot;You wanted to be president. You wanted to be the president's veterinarian.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant corporations brought a motion for summary judgment in the federal trial court claiming lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff estate executor brought racketeering claims under U.S.C.S. &sect; 1962(c) and (d), alleging defendants committed fraudulent conduct before the U.S. Customs Service in claiming defendants were not under common control and ownership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff estate executor substituted as plaintiff in an action alleging defendant corporations committed racketeering violations. Plaintiff claimed its decedent suffered damages, including emotional distress, where defendants claimed before customs that they were not under common ownership and control. Plaintiff alleged the fraudulent purpose of defendants' claims was to gain the right to prevent the importation of products bearing defendants' trademark into the United States. Defendants brought a motion for summary judgment claiming the court was without subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court denied defendants' motion in part, and granted in part, holding jurisdiction of customs to hear the claims was not exclusive where administrative determination of the issues did not promote uniformity. The court dismissed plaintiff's claims for emotional distress where emotional distress damages were unrecognized under the statute. Where genuine issues of fact existed, the court held summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The trial court granted defendants' motion in part and denied in part, holding where plaintiff's claims for emotional damages was not available under the statute, no recovery was possible. Where genuine issues of fact existed, the court found summary judgment was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff claims that Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. (&quot;Rolex U.S.A.&quot;), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, and Montres Rolex, S.A. (&quot;Montres&quot;), a Swiss corporation, are under common ownership and control. He alleges that defendants, through acts of mail and wire fraud, unlawfully conspired to submit to the United States Customs Service (&quot;Customs&quot;) documents which fraudulently stated that Rolex U.S.A. was not owned or controlled by Montres, the Swiss owner of the &quot;ROLEX&quot; trademark. Am. Cplt. at paras. 30-33. The allegedly false representations consisted of a statement filed by Rolex with Customs on January 7, 1983 and letters sent to Customs on April 12, 1983 and May 11, 1984. Am. Cplt. at paras. 31-32. The purported aim of this conspiracy was to gain the protection of 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1526(a), which allows the domestic owner of a registered trademark to prevent the unauthorized importation of products bearing that trademark (so-called &quot;gray-market&quot; goods).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN1] To employ Section 1526, the trademark owner must record the trademark with Customs. 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1526 (a).

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 13, 1985, Shaw, by his agents, sought to import eight genuine Rolex watches. Am. Cplt. at para. 44. Customs seized the watches, and on August 8, 1985, plaintiff was indicted by a federal grand &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*130]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury for, inter alia, smuggling, entry of goods by means of false statement, importing goods contrary to law, and making false statements. Plts. Exh. 7. Subsequent to the indictment, Shaw alleges that he was hospitalized for treatment of Ramsey Hunt Syndrome, a painful nervous disorder. After five months, during which plaintiff allegedly suffered severe emotional and physical distress, the indictment was dismissed. Am. Cplt. at paras. 45-46. On May 23, 1986, Shaw entered into an agreement with Customs in which he obtained release of the eight Rolex watches for exportation in exchange for his waiver of certain rights in connection with the detention, seizure, and/or release by Customs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the watches. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the years of 1985-86, plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Soller, submitted material to Customs challenging the propriety of the Rolex recordation. Defs. Rule 3(g) Statement at paras. 39-40. By letter dated June 16, 1986, Customs notified defendants' attorneys that it had &quot;concluded that protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***1918]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against the importation of genuine, so-called 'gray market,' goods is not available to your client,&quot; because Rolex U.S.A. &quot;is under common ownership or control, either beneficial and/or legal, with a foreign company owning the trademark abroad.&quot; Plts. Exh. 10. The letter stated that effective thirty days therefrom, Customs would not continue to protect Rolex U.S.A. against the importation of gray-market goods. Some copies of the letter bore a notation that the effective date may be delayed. Plts. Exh. 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to defendants' letter of June 25, 1986, Customs agreed to defer the effective date &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of removal of protection until August 16, 1986 in order to consider defendants' submissions bearing on the issue of its ownership structure. Plts. Exh. 12. Defendant Rolex U.S.A. did, in fact, submit information to Customs in 1986, including materials pertaining to the ownership of the trademark &quot;ROLEX&quot; in Switzerland and the U.S. and the corporate structure of the various Rolex companies. Defs. Rule 3(g) Statement at paras. 42-43.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 7, 1988, plaintiff's attorney wrote to Customs asking them finally to implement their letter of June 16, 1986 and remove gray-market protection for the &quot;ROLEX&quot; trademark. Defs. Exh. D-0014. Customs responded by letter on September 16, 1988; however, the nature of the response was far from clear. Defs. Exh.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">3&nbsp;The parties dispute the meaning of the September 1988 letter. Plaintiff interprets it to mean that &quot;the proposed revocation of gray-market protection for Rolex was still being deferred.&quot; Plts. Memorandum at 3. Defendants, on the other hand, emphasize the portion of that letter which states that &quot;'at this time, removal of trademark protection does not appear warranted.'&quot; Defs. Memorandum at 14-15. Accordingly, plaintiff characterizes Customs as having &quot;deferred the revocation of the recordation,&quot; and defendants characterize Customs as having &quot;maintained&quot; the recordation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants characterize plaintiff's RICO action against Rolex as an action to protest Customs' exclusion of the eight watches from entry into the United States.

Plaintiff's RICO action seeking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only money damages against Rolex does not fall within the scope of Section 1581(a) and hence does not properly lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIT. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congress's overriding purpose in enacting 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1581 was to establish uniformity and expertise in certain matters of international trade by consolidating jurisdiction over such matters in a single specialized court.

It involved a declaratory judgment action by an importer of luggage, which allegedly carried a counterfeit trademark, for an order releasing luggage which was held by Customs. Though the plaintiff named Gucci as a defendant, its actual grievance was with Customs and the relief sought, release of the goods, was that which could be granted by the administrative agency and reviewed by the CIT. Shaw's grievance, by contrast, is not with Customs. He alleges only that he was injured by the actions of the defendants, in that they knowingly submitted false documents to Customs upon which Customs relied in granting Rolex the U.S. trademark recordation to Rolex in 1983.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants also assert that the Court must dismiss Shaw's RICO action under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. However, defendants' assertion indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of that doctrine. The doctrine is a flexible one and is &quot;'concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties.'&quot; Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U.S. 290, 303, 48 L. Ed. 2d 643, 96 S. Ct. 1978 (1976) (quoting United States v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126, 77 S. Ct. 161 (1956)).  [HN5] It is invoked when a court, having unquestioned jurisdiction over a case, determines that &quot;it may be appropriate to refer specific issues to an agency for initial determination where that procedure would secure 'uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency'&quot; or where &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the special expertise of the agency is required for the resolution of technical issues. Nader, 426 U.S. at 303-04. In such an instance, the court will suspend the action pending administrative determination of the issues referred. Id. at 63-64. See also J. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*132]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stein, G. Mitchell &amp; B. Mezines, 5 Administrative Law &sect; 47.01[1] (rev. ed. 1991).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referral of the issues underlying this RICO action cannot be justified by the interest in promoting uniformity and accuracy of decisionmaking within an agency's area of expertise. The standards of fraudulent misrepresentation and omission to be applied in this RICO action are within the conventional competence of this Court. Cf. Nader, 426 U.S. 290, at 305-06, 48 L. Ed. 2d 643, 96 S. Ct. 1978 (1976) (referral of misrepresentation issue to the administrative agency not justified by the interest in informing the court's final decision with the expertise of that agency). Moreover, while Customs may investigate fraud in the application process, Congress has authorized only the courts to award the extraordinary remedy of treble damages and attorney's fees under RICO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants cite three cases for the proposition that, where a procedure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for administrative review is established, a claim based on alleged fraud before a federal administrative agency should first be pursued before that agency. See Alberta Gas Chemicals, Ltd. v. Celanese Corp., 650 F.2d 9 (2d Cir. 1981) (action for common law fraud and unfair competition against corporation based upon its presentation of allegedly perjurious testimony before the International Trade Commission); Meditech Int'l Co. v. Minigrip, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 1488 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (action alleging violations of the Sherman Act and RICO based upon defendant's alleged unlawful conduct in misleading the International Trade Commission); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. v. Rubber Mfrs. Ass'n, 509 F. Supp. 912 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (antitrust action alleging that defendants made false certifications which caused Customs to impose excessive duties on plaintiff).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In suggesting that those cases establish a rule to be applied in all cases where fraud before an administrative agency is alleged, defendants ignore the nature of the doctrine of primary agency jurisdiction, which &quot;calls for a decision based on the particular facts of each case.&quot; United States v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 69, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126, 77 S. Ct. 161 (1956).&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In each of the cases cited by defendants, the court deferred jurisdiction until such time as the plaintiff could present its case to the agency in question. In those cases, initial resort to the agency had the potential to result in a determination which would moot or narrow the issues to be considered by the district court. In the instant case, by contrast, it is evident that further resort to Customs would be unavailing. Since 1985, Customs has been aware that Shaw, by his attorney, Mr. Soller, challenges the propriety of the trademark protection granted to Rolex U.S.A. Defs. Rule 3(g) Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at paras. 39-41. By letter dated June 16, 1986, Customs even concluded that the Rolex U.S.A. recordation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***1920]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should be revoked because of evidence suggesting that the U.S. and the Swiss owners of the &quot;ROLEX&quot; trademark were under common ownership and control. Defs. Exh. 10. Since that time, however, and after the submission of additional information by Rolex, Customs has declined to act on its decision with respect to the recordation. In view of Customs' continued inaction, referral of this matter once again to Customs would be unnecessarily expensive and likely to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have a preordained outcome, fostering further needless delay. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>8</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">8&nbsp;Defendant similarly argues that the doctrine requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies applies in this case. That doctrine provides &quot;'that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.'&quot; McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 193, 23 L. Ed. 2d 194, 89 S. Ct. 1657 (1969) (quoting Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 82 L. Ed. 638, 58 S. Ct. 459 (1938)). Since the Court has concluded that plaintiff's RICO action is fundamentally different from an action challenging the exclusion of merchandise, over which the agency and the CIT would have exclusive jurisdiction, the Court rejects defendants' exhaustion arguments.</SPAN></P>

In this respect, defendants contend that all the information allegedly withheld from Customs was submitted to Customs in 1985 and 1986. Consequently, defendants argue that plaintiff cannot show that Customs relied in 1983, since &quot;the disclosure [by Rolex] to Customs in 1986 of the information which the Complaint alleges was fraudulently concealed from Customs did not result in withdrawal of the recordation.&quot; Defs. Memorandum at 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff contends that, contrary to defendants' assertions, Customs has not ruled definitively that defendants' recordation of the U.S. trademark with Customs should not be revoked. Instead, plaintiff submits that the September 16, 1988 letter from Customs to Mr. Soller indicates that Customs continues to defer its decision to revoke Rolex's &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gray-market protection. Plts. Sur-reply at 3. Hence, they argue, there is a disputed question of fact as to whether Customs reviewed all the allegedly relevant information in 1986 and found, in fact, that Rolex U.S.A. is entitled to the U.S. trademark recordation. In addition, plaintiff argues that &quot;the issue is not so much whether Customs decided to revoke the recordation, but whether defendants would have been awarded gray-market protection if they had originally made the required disclosures.&quot; Plts. Memorandum at 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court concludes that defendants' assertion that Customs had all the allegedly omitted information in 1986 and still declined to revoke the recordation does not meet their burden of demonstrating clearly that no genuine issue of fact exists on the issue of reliance. The 1988 letter from Customs to Mr. Soller does not state unambiguously that Customs has reviewed all the submitted materials with respect to the corporate ownership structure of Rolex and decided that Rolex U.S.A. is entitled to protection against the importation of gray-market goods. While the letter does state that &quot;at this time, removal of trademark protection does not appear warranted,&quot; it also indicates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that there is a &quot;lingering question of ownership&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***1921]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or control of the 'ROLEX' trademark&quot; which is not yet resolved. Moreover, it states that the presentation by Rolex U.S.A. in 1986 &quot;resulted in deferring any removal of gray market protection&quot; (emphasis added). Defs. Exh. D-0016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff should be afforded the opportunity at trial to prove that Customs did not conclusively determine the issue of whether Rolex U.S.A. is under common ownership &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*134]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or control with the Swiss owner of the &quot;ROLEX&quot; trademark. Moreover, plaintiff should be permitted to show that any determination by Customs in 1986 is not indicative of how Customs would have decided the issue of ownership or control initially in 1983 had defendants originally submitted the allegedly concealed information. Consequently, defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue is denied.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Waiver</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants also argue that summary judgment is appropriate in this action, because Shaw signed an agreement with Customs on May 23, 1986 (see Defs. Exh. F-33) in which he &quot;released all claims against Customs based on the detention/seizure of the eight watches in exchange for obtaining the watches for export.&quot; Defs. Reply Br. at 7. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They contend that the instant case is exactly analogous to the situation presented in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. v. Rubber Mfrs. Ass'n, 509 F. Supp. 912, 916 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). In that case, the District Court concluded that plaintiffs' agreement with Customs prohibited reopening the question of the validity of the duties levied on plaintiff's goods imported before October 2, 1979, including the question of whether the defendants had influenced Customs through false certifications to impose the alleged excessive duties. Id. at 916.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While defendants contend that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is exactly analogous to the case at issue and can support a finding that Shaw has waived his rights to proceed against Rolex in this RICO action, plaintiff contends that its agreement with Customs &quot;did not constitute a waiver of any legal remedies against anyone other than Customs.&quot; Plts. Sur-reply at 6. Because the agreement in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the one entered into by Shaw appear to contain significantly different language, the Court declines to hold as a matter of law that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> controls the disposition of this issue. The interpretation of the agreement entered into between Shaw and Customs and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its significance is a matter more appropriately left for trial. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>9</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">9&nbsp;Defendants additionally assert that this Court should find as a matter of law that defendants' alleged fraud did not proximately cause plaintiff's injury. While several of defendants' arguments in support of that assertion may be appealing, the Court believes that they depend upon the resolution of factual issues, including: whether defendants' recordation with Customs was unlawful; and whether defendants would have been able to maintain and succeed in a private action against Shaw under &sect; 1526 for unlawful importation of the watches had defendants not been entitled to the protection of the Customs Regulations. The Court has already concluded that there are material issues of fact on the reliance issue which require a trial on the merits; consequently, the parties will have ample opportunity to present their positions on the proximate cause issue at that time.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Damages for Emotional Distress Under RICO</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Opinion and Order dated November 12, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1987, this Court dismissed Shaw's common law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, Shaw maintains that he is entitled to recover for emotional distress as damages under RICO. Defendants take issue with Shaw's contention and argue that RICO does not permit recovery for emotional distress or physical injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN7] To state a claim under RICO, the plaintiff must allege injury to business or property by reason of a RICO violation. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1964(c). As defendants point out, courts have uniformly held that injuries such as emotional distress or physical injury are not cognizable under RICO. See, e.g., Fleischhauer v. Feltner, 879 F.2d 1290, 1300 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1074, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1029, 110 S. Ct. 1122 (1990), and cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1027, 108 L. Ed. 2d 611, 110 S. Ct. 1473 (1990); Drake v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 782 F.2d 638, 644 (6th Cir. 1986); Rafferty v. Halprin, No. 90 Civ. 2751, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10344, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 1991); James v. Lan-o-Tone Prods., Inc., No. 88 Civ. 7716, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6333 at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 1989); Pohlot v. Pohlot, 664 F. Supp. 112, 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1987).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaw has cited no case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the contrary. Instead, he attempts to distinguish defendants' authorities on the grounds that they address only the question of whether emotional distress or physical injury, in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*135]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  absence of attendant damage to business or property, establishes a claim under RICO. However, this distinction is not supported by the case law or the statutory language. In Fleischhauer, the Sixth Circuit limited a claim for relief under RICO to the amount of damages sustained to plaintiff's business or property -- any attendant damages due to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***1922]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  physical injury or emotional distress were not recoverable. 879 F.2d at 1300. See also Cuzzupe v. Paparone Realty Co., 596 F. Supp. 988, 991 (D. N.J. 1984) (dismissing plaintiffs' attendant claims for emotional distress and personal injury as damages under RICO where plaintiffs had alleged injury to business and property); Callan v. State Chemical Mfg. Co., 584 F. Supp. 619, 623 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (lost income was recoverable under RICO; however, damages for the alleged attendant mental anguish were not).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaw refers the Court to the principle that the RICO statute should be construed broadly to serve its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remedial purposes. See Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 498, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346, 105 S. Ct. 3275 (1985). However, reference to RICO's broad remedial purposes cannot alter the unambiguous language of the statute. The requirement that the injury be to the plaintiff's business or property implies that treble damages are only recoverable for injuries of a proprietary nature. Plaintiff's alleged injuries to his emotional or physical well-being do not meet this requirement. Consequently, to the extent that plaintiff's claims for damages under RICO are based on emotional distress or physical injury, those claims are dismissed.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Conclusion</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied. However, insofar as the RICO claims seek damages based on emotional distress, those claims are dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His performance when Melbourne Croatia fought back from a goal down to beat Wollongong Macedonia 2-1 at the weekend earned rave reviews from the media and he was the automatic choice for the weekly award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the veteran Socceroo was reluctant to accept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I felt I worked hard, but the game was marred by a strong wind and didn't lend itself to outstanding performances,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was my first outing in midfield, but it turned into a game for defences having to cope with long balls. All we did in the middle of the park was battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the team won praise for its battling performance, new Melbourne Croatia coach Ken Worden was less than satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says most of the players have to lift their game by 15 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davidson was among those targeted. He was told he did an adequate job but more was expected of him because of his achievements and experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He told me I've played at just about every level and expected more of me,&quot; Davidson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I accept the award, there'll be no end of ribbing in the dressing room this week.&quot; Worden might have been critical in the dressing room, but he agreed Davidson deserved the award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was the orchestrator in a good team effort,&quot; Worden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is not just a hard worker or marker, his experience and confidence and knowledge of the game allowed for a good steady job.&quot; As Davidson continues to produce on the field, he is already preparing for a post-playing career in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is doing coaching courses and enjoys being involved in the media with a column in the Sunday Sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has given me the chance to air my views, but it has also been a real education to find out how the press works,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the weekly winner, Davidson collects a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners valued at $280. He also collects votes towards the end of season award.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it's not a local derby, it has been the pressure of bouncing back from a defeat or hitting back at criticism of its playing style. Even against the lower sides the expectations have been not only to win comfortably, but also to do it with flair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South's annual clashes against sister club Sydney Olympic have also been regarded as special and a means of proving which of the Greek backed clubs is more dominant in the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunday's clash between the two in Sydney has an added ingredient, according to South striker Kimon Taliadoros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every game South Melbourne plays is a big game, but personally, I have been looking forward to this one for some time,&quot; Taliadoros said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They knocked us out of the finals last season and this is more of a revenge game for me. It was that way when we met them at home earlier this season, but I believe we still owe them.&quot; Taliadoros celebrated his return to the senior side after a seven-week absence by scoring two goals in the 7-3 win over Wollongong Mac last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His effort earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award for round 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is certainly the highest scoring game I've been involved in my senior career,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taliadoros paid special credit to his striking partner Paul Trimboli for the goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you look into them, you'll find that Trimmers was involved in almost all the goals at some stage.He was an integral part of my two,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As is the case with most South Melbourne goals, they were the result of excellent teamwork.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUGGED defender Andrew Marth yesterday admitted he has not yet hit his best form despite the recent media clamor for his inclusion in the Socceroos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The switch by Marth to a double centre-back role has helped Melbourne Croatia challenge for the NSL championship and earned praise from national coach Eddie Thomson who said the defender was on the verge of a call-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomson took note of how Marth and George Hannah blotted out Warren Spink last Sunday. Only days earlier Spink had troubled Czechoslovakia with his sharpness and confidence to take defenders on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marth also took the free kick which led to the winning goal against Preston Makedonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Marth concedes that his form is improving, he believes he has played better in the NSL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My second season at Sunshine George Cross (in 1988) was my best season and I ended up being the club's player of the year,&quot; Marth said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I still think I haven't played as well since although this season is now shaping up to go close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marth is now part of Melbourne Croatia's ambitious charge for the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The change of coach (at Melbourne Croatia) has made a big difference. Ken Worden has a playing style similar to John Gardiner (Marth's coach at Sunshine) and I'm enjoying the freedom to play the ball out of the back (rather than kicking long balls),&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clarkson, man of the match in the past two rounds, earned the player of the week title for his display against Wollongong Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three votes gives him 17 and equal leadership with St George keeper John Filan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had gone for five weeks without picking up votes so it's nice to get some reward for playing well,&quot; Clarkson said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The midfielder returned to Melbourne yesterday after making a hurried dash across the Tasman to see his sick sister in Hobart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clarkson was a committed supporter of previous Sunshine coach Ernie Merrick, who brought him to the club from Adelaide City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were suggestions that Clarkson and teammate Craig Foster would walk out of the club after Merrick's dismissal but the player has killed off those rumors with his good form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I certainly didn't like the way Ernie was sacked but it's good to have Tony Vrzina around and it's very important for all the players to stick by the new coach,&quot; Clarkson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clarkson admitted that desperation had played a part in his recent good form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All of us are playing for our survival as well as the club's,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I certainly hope the club won't be relegated but either way we have to try and lift ourselves and play better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the worst was to happen and the club was relegated, the players will be judged on their performances if they are to get another club.&quot; As the weekly winner, Clarkson receives a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners valued at $280.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT HAS taken four years, but Heidelberg's Willie Herd has finally proved himself a quality player, justifying his reputation and excellent record in Scottish football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herd was a prize signing by Melbourne Croatia in 1987 after accepting an invitation to play here despite being firmly established in the Scottish first division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The midfielder admitted yesterday the first two seasons turned into disasters after tearing a cartilage in the first game at his new club.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I went to Brunswick Juventus the season after and had a groin problem which again required an operation and ruled me out for the full season,&quot; Herd said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was frustrating and inexplicable, especially since, in 10 years of senior football in Scotland, I hardly ever missed a game, and by the time I came here I had played over 300 league games.&quot; Herd broke into senior soccer as a 17-year-old with East Fife. He was transferred for $40,000 to Falkirk when he was 20, and three years later joined Partick Thistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(Melbourne Croatia's) Paul Donnelly had accepted an offer to play in Perth at the time and he got in touch. I felt I could do with a change and, on his advice, chose to join an NSL club.&quot; Herd felt he had made the wrong move after the two serious injuries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heidelberg goalkeeper, the No.1 choice for Australia between 1986-89, is determined to regain the Socceroo crown from Robert Zabica and John Filan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olver believes that at 30 he is still young in goalkeeping terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you look at the World Cup finals, you'll find the average age of the keepers is 35-36 with a few exceptions, like Zoff and Shilton, going well beyond that,&quot; Olver said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If form rather than age is the prerequisite for a spot in the national side, Olver has gone a long way towards staking a claim with his displays for Heidelberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the start of the season all the raves were about (St George keeper) Filan but I've looked for consistency rather than spectacular saves and I'm very pleased with my own form and the team's overall,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olver was singled out for praise by coach Len McKendry after his keeping ensured a 1-0 win over Wollongong Mac and the two points made certain Heidelberg finishes clear of the relegation zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That match was our cup final,&quot; he said. &quot;It was worth four points as a defeat would have dragged us back near the bottom two.&quot; Olver's performance against Wollongong Mac earns him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo Jackson the athlete may be on the bench, but Bo Jackson the product spokesman may be busier than ever, said Richard Woods, a lawyer in Mobile, Ala., who is Jackson's agent.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In some ways this is a lucky break,&quot; Woods said Thursday. &quot;This will give him a lot of time to work on new and ongoing projects.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Kansas City Royals released him earlier this week, they said Jackson was not likely to be able to play baseball again, but his own doctor was much more optimistic. Jackson, who is also a pro football player with the Los Angeles Raiders, injured his left hip in an NFL playoff game in January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many advertising executives say that if Jackson never plays sports again, his value as a product spokesman will surely be diminished.  But several said he still has more than enough name recognition and good will to have a fruitful career as an endorser.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's famous for being Bo Jackson. He is a celebrity over and beyond his sports,&quot; said Brian J. Murphy, publisher of Sports Marketing Letter in Westport, Conn.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not sitting still, said Woods, his agent. Within the next couple of weeks, he said, a deal will be announced that will establish Jackson as a &quot;leading public personality.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some speculation in the ad industry that Jackson will do a sports-oriented television program. Agency executives who have worked with him say he has acting talent and has become<BR>&nbsp;<BR>t<BR>&nbsp;<BR>t adept at self-deprecating humor.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson recently signed a contract with Diversified Products, which will introduce a line of Bo Jackson exercise equipment later this year. Also, he can now devote more time to personal appearances and ads for Bo Med, a line of products for amateur athletes, like an analgesic rub and cold packs for sprains.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent news conference, Jackson hobbled, on crutches, onto a stage to make a speech for Bo Med.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The injuries don't hurt,&quot; said Mike Vineyard, president of Cramer Products, which makes the line. &quot;It ties him closer to the products.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While marketing specialists maintain that Jackson still has a future in product endorsements, the potential payout is likely to be reduced.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marty Blackman, of sports-marketing consultants Blackman and Raber Ltd. in New York, says Jackson has not played long enough to transcend sports celebrity and join the ranks of celebrity&nbsp; superstars like Joe Namath.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was never on a World Series or Super Bowl team. He was a great athlete (but) I don't see at this stage where he could rank among the immortals,&quot; said Blackman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wood has said that Jackson earns &quot;much more&quot; money from product endorsements than from sports. His first three-year </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deal was said to be worth between $ 2-million and $ 3-million a year, and he recently signed a new three-year deal with the company.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson makes about $ 750,000 with the Raiders and had made about $ 1-million a year with the Royals, according to reports.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman Liz Borden said that the company &quot;backs Bo all the way and we believe that he will be back.&quot; But she added it's &quot;too soon to tell&quot; what would happen if his injuries force him to drop out of sports completely.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's hard to say, partly because we don't know what Bo will want to do. If Bo retires, then obviously we are faced with a very different situation,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no ads of Jackson alone scheduled to run in the near term, according to Borden. A current ad showing Jackson with other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stars will continue to run.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising agency is now considering the contents of a summer ad campaign for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross-trainers. Jackson has appeared in it in the past three summers. &quot;It's not impossible&quot; that he'll be in it again this year, said Borden.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Information from the Los Angeles Daily News was used in this report.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Yormak, one of the few baseball agents based in Canada, has<BR>resigned his certification after facing an investigation by the Major<BR>League Players Association. Yormak, whose clients included Toronto Blue<BR>Jay outfielders Rob Ducey and Glenallen Hill, is a lawyer in the London,<BR>Ont., area and a Canadian citizen, although he was born in the United<BR>States. Mike Weiner, the assistant general counsel of the players<BR>association, said: &quot;He resigned his certification as an agent in the<BR>context of an investigation. The end result was that Mr. Yormak chose to<BR>resign.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ducey and Hill have not been without controversy as Blue Jays. Ducey, a<BR>Canadian from Cambridge, Ont., has requested trades after assignments to<BR>the minor leagues. He also sued the SkyDome over a knee injury suffered in<BR>1989. Hill was embroiled in a dispute with the Jays over his 1990 contract<BR>offer. Yormak chose not to comment on his resignation. He says he has<BR>moved into the baseball marketing and licencing business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   A last-minute change in advertising strategy by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has eliminated from  the North American market a television commercial directed by Canadian  David Cronenberg. An ad campaign for the Air 180 running shoe was to  include commercials made by 12 internationally renowned directors  including Cronenberg, Frederico Fellini of Italy, Eiko of Japan, the  Laurenstein brothers of Germany and Jean-Luc Godard of France. Each  director shot a 15-second segment depicting one concept of the Air 180  shoe. It was to be shown Sunday during the Super Bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronenberg's spot, filmed in Toronto in October, is set on a distant<BR>planet and features a creature that farms Air 180s growing in insect-like<BR>pods. In December, however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pulled the plug on the international TV<BR>spots for the North American market, although they will be aired in Europe<BR>and Asia. Glenn Wakefield, the national advertising manager of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, said there were two main reasons for the change - differences<BR>between North American and European and Asian tastes in advertising and<BR>knowledge of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The ads were &quot;very European,&quot; he said. &quot;More of an<BR>artistic theme.&quot;<BR>Sources: Marketing, Advertising Age</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   A booklet with the title, Drug Free, has been published by the U.S.  Olympic Committee to warn athletes about the dangers of drug use. In  addition to discouraging competitors from using steroids and other  performance-enhancing substances, the booklet appears to be a how-to for  avoiding detection of marijuana use. Marijuana is not considered a  performance-enhancing drug and it is not on the International Olympic  Committee's banned list. However, it is banned by the national governing  bodies of some sports and may be tested for at their request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the heading How long does marijuana stay in the system? the USOC<BR>reports, &quot;Breakdown products can show up in urine four to 10 days after<BR>smoking a single joint, and up to 36 days after chronic marijuana smokers<BR>quit. THC, the mind-altering ingredient in marijuana, is absorbed into the<BR>body and transformed into metabolites, which can be detected in the urine<BR>for weeks after use.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM HOUSTON<BR>The St. Louis Blues are expected to pick up at least three major National<BR>Hockey League awards at the end of the season. Right winger Brett Hull (72<BR>goals) is favoured to win the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable<BR>player. Brian Sutter is the choice of most for coach-of-the-year honours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive of the year category (a Hockey News award) is likely to be<BR>won by general manager Ron Caron, who has built the Blues largely through<BR>trades.<BR> Best defenceman: A tight competition among four candidates - Brian Leetch<BR>of the New York Rangers, Al MacInnis of the Calgary Flames, Boston Bruin<BR>Raymond Bourque and Paul Coffey of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Bourque has<BR>been inconsistent and Coffey is a minus 15. Leetch leads his team in<BR>scoring, but MacInnis is tops overall among defencemen in points and has<BR>an impressive plus-minus (plus 39). MacInnis wins.<BR> Rookie of the year: Detroit Red Wing centre Sergei Fedorov (a Soviet)<BR>leads rookies in points and is probably the most spectacular first-year<BR>player in the NHL since Mario Lemieux. Chicago Blackhawk goaltender Ed<BR>Belfour will finish second.<BR> Top goaltender: Belfour (37 wins, 18 losses and 5 ties, 2.45 goals-<BR>against average) will win the Vezina Trophy. Rangers' Mike Richter (19-9-<BR>6, 2.92) should finish second.<BR>                        Baseball flag wavers <BR> Major-league baseball will honour the allied effort in the Persian Gulf<BR>War by designating a U.S. flag decal for the back of the batter's helmet.<BR>What might surprise some is the decision to include the Canadian flag on<BR>the helmets of all major-league teams - not just the two based in Canada.<BR>From the back, the U.S. flag will be on the left and the Canadian flag on<BR>the right. That's for the U.S. teams. The positions will be reversed on<BR>Montreal Expo and Toronto Blue Jay helmets.<BR>                          King of drinkers <BR> Reports of professional athletes' drinking habits are more common in the<BR>British media than in North America, although it's often treated as an<BR>indiscretion in Britain rather than a problem. One example was a recent<BR>story about striker Paul Moran of Tottenham Hotspur, who was loaned to<BR>Newcastle for six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He says he was unaware of a club rule that prohibited drinking 48 hours<BR>before a match. So two days before his anticipated debut, he went out on<BR>the town with Paul (Gazza) Gascoigne, a partier and controversial<BR>Tottenham player who is England's new star on the international scene.<BR>According to Moran, they didn't drink much - just two bottles of beer -<BR>but that was enough to get him kicked off the team. Newcastle didn't<BR>escape embarrassment. On game day its program included a feature on Moran.<BR>Asked in the article what he was better at doing than anyone else on the<BR>team, his one-word answer was: &quot;Drinking.&quot;<BR>Sources: People, Sun, Today (England)</SPAN></P>

The No. 1 shoe in the world, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which holds 28 per cent of the market,  is under attack from No. 2 ranked Reebok International, L.A. Gear (No.3),  British Knights (No.6), and others.   British Knights is hoping a $15-million (U.S.) advertising campaign will  establish it as the shoe for a new generation. In one of its commercials,  one youth tells another, &quot;Your mother wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; In another, rapper M.  C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Marina Strauss<BR>Marketing Reporter<BR> HOW do you get the attention of the fickle but big-spending Canadian<BR>teen-ager? The people who make Doritos will tell you it isn't easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Before they put their Doritos commercials on the air in January, the<BR>marketers at Hostess Frito-Lay Co. spent a year studying the way teen-<BR>agers dress, talk and think. Their researchers spent hundreds of hours<BR>hanging around malls, schools and fast-food outlets to watch teen-agers<BR>hanging around. They made notes and they shot videotape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marketers mulled over hundreds of concepts, then hired a top teen<BR>researcher from (where else?) California to test some of the ideas. They<BR>shot the commercials there, too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they came up with is a series of 18 offbeat and fast-paced spots<BR>built around a cool mystery man named Bob, who never actually appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one, a girl in a bathing suit stands under a sprinkler and chants<BR>passionately: &quot;He's hot. He's hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another, a boy lies on the floor of a bowling alley lane kicking his<BR>legs in excitement. At the end, the words Bob's Favourite Snack appear on<BR>the screen with a crumpled Doritos bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bob campaign works because it speaks to kids in their own language<BR>- and it's fun, industry observers say. The ads are full of irreverent<BR>images and thoughts, but at the same time they show kids in groups, where<BR>they feel comfortable and secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the average adult, the commercials, which cost about $900,000 to<BR>make, look weird. But they seem to be selling a lot of tortilla chips.<BR>&quot;Bob and Doritos are becoming part of the teen culture,&quot; bragged W. E.<BR>(Ted) McKechnie, vice-president of marketing for Hostess in Mississauga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitching to this age group isn't easy. &quot;You never understand teens, and<BR>the moment you think you do, you're in trouble,&quot; Mr. McKechnie warned at a<BR>recent teen marketing conference in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more and more marketers figure it's worth the trouble. The teen<BR>market is worth an estimated $6-billion, a figure expected to climb to<BR>$10-billion within a decade. There are now about 2.5 million people in<BR>Canada aged 12 to 19, a number that will increase to almost 2.8 million by<BR>2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these youngsters have jobs and money in their pockets. What is<BR>more, they influence their parents' spending habits on everything from<BR>food to cars, home electronics and computer equipment, said Len Gill,<BR>president of Echo Advertising and Marketing Inc. in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the older generation often has trouble understanding teens and<BR>communicating - rather than preaching - to them, marketers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teens today are different from teens of the sixties, said Joe Grieco,<BR>the Los Angeles-based teen researcher who worked on the Doritos campaign.<BR>They're more realistic, more tolerant of others and more optimistic that<BR>they can change things. They're not nearly as angry or hostile as their<BR>baby-boomer parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teens are rebellious, as they always have been, and are attracted to<BR>irreverent images. But at the same time, they want to conform. As Mr.<BR>McKechnie puts it: &quot;They want to be rebellious without rebellion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier Doritos campaign went too far, said Carmen Davidson, account<BR>supervisor at Young &amp; Rubicam Ltd. in Toronto, the agency that designed<BR>the Doritos ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One commercial showed a teen-ager driving the wrong way down a one-way<BR>street. When the company tested it, the teen-agers told them they didn't<BR>like being depicted as lawbreakers, Ms. Davidson said. The campaign was<BR>ditched before it went on the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some marketers have found that the generation gap is not what it once<BR>was. They have hit on ads that appeal to both teens and their baby-boomer<BR>parents - cutting down on the cost of creating different advertising for<BR>each age group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a commercial for Toronto-based Pepsi-Cola Canada Ltd., a principal<BR>scolds a pupil for drinking Coke in class. The pupil counters that he was<BR>drinking Pepsi. The taste-test patrol arrives and the principal chooses<BR>Pepsi over Coke in a blind taste test. The final shot shows the principal<BR>and the boy sitting happily together, enjoying their Pepsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Baranowski, Pepsi's director of marketing, said that if this ad<BR>had been made in the sixties, the teen-ager probably would have rejected<BR>the principal as a loser for not knowing that Pepsi was cool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ads such as the taste-test one work well, Mr. Baranowski said, because<BR>teen-agers have adopted many of the attitudes and preferences of their<BR>parents - who have been a key focus of marketers' attention in past years.<BR>And the boomer parents support many teen causes, such as saving the<BR>environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some companies have cashed in on the distinctive traits of the<BR>echo generation, the children of the baby-boomers. Knitwear giant Benetton<BR>Group SpA of Italy uses a series of upbeat ads that celebrate multiracial<BR>harmony - reflecting the optimism and tolerance among today's teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levi Strauss &amp; Co. of San Francisco, which makes blue jeans, and<BR>footwear maker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., also carefully cater to<BR>teens' seemingly contradictory need for both conformity and individuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levi's ads show confident, macho-looking men in the irreverent act of<BR>stripping down to their underpants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uses bad-boy tennis star Andre<BR>Agassi as a spokesman - but it also depends on squeaky-clean Michael<BR>Jordan to tout its shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not depend on the unconventional image of Mr. Agassi alone,<BR>but needed the anchor of Mr. Jordan to appeal to the conformist side of<BR>modern teen-agers, said Catherine Murray, vice-president of Decima<BR>Research in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job of wooing teens gets more challenging all the time. Teen-agers<BR>are more critical of commercials than adults, and in this age of<BR>television zapping they tune out quickly, Ms. Murray said. &quot;To marshall<BR>that restlessness you've got to keep the unexpected working in your<BR>court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used to change the style or colour of its shoes every six months,<BR>said Glenn Wakefield, national advertising manager for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada Ltd. in<BR>Thornhill, Ont. Now, in order to keep the kids interested, it's marketing<BR>new shoes every three months. &quot;What is hot with teens now will not be hot<BR>with them by the end of the summer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c9"> Money to spend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Percentage of teenagers who:.........  Have full-time jobs.............14%..  Have part-time jobs.............28%..  Work at odd jobs................38%..  Have a regular allowance........27%..  Get money from parents as.......41%..  necessary............................   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> miffed some parents this fall with its commercial of&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood&quot; - which featured NBA star David Robinson&nbsp;saying &quot;Can you say kick some butt'?&quot; - the nation's No. 1 athletic shoe&nbsp;company has been making amends. It has been casting Mr. Robinson in less&nbsp;ambiguous, heroic roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago, he appeared in a commercial playing piano with a 78-&nbsp;year-old concert pianist. Now Mr. Robinson is being plastered all over&nbsp;America (except Atlanta) on 1,200 public service billboards in 20&nbsp;markets. He's urging kids to stay in school.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billboard shows Mr. Robinson hoisting a stack of books. A&nbsp;basketball sits on top of them. Beside the photo is a huge headline that&nbsp;reads: &quot;Don't Be Stoopid. Stay In School. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are the lastest in the series of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Stay In School&quot;&nbsp;promotions that the company says are intended to &quot;reach the youth of&nbsp;America in a positive way about achievement and excellence as it relates&nbsp;to both education and athletics.&quot; Another ad, featuring another NBA star,&nbsp;Michael Jordan, and actor/director Spike Lee aired over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and other expensive athletic shoe makers, such as Reebok, have&nbsp;stepped up their public service activities in the last year as they've&nbsp;come under pressure by minority and public interest groups concerned&nbsp;about the popularity of the shoes among inner-city youths and resulting&nbsp;crimes.; Hold the ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1960's are considered the Golden Age of Advertising. That's when&nbsp;Americans delighted in watching commercials such as Alka-Seltzer's hall-&nbsp;of-fame &quot;No matter what shape your stomach's in&quot; ads, which featured&nbsp;bouncy music and shots of every shape of human stomach imaginable - from&nbsp;a belly dancer, to a fat guy working a jackhammer, to a woman arguing&nbsp;with a chubby man on the street while poking him in the stomach with a&nbsp;pointed finger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those golden days, less than half of America (43 percent) wanted&nbsp;television without commercials, according to a Columbia University study.&nbsp;Thirty years later, the university reports, almost two-thirds of America&nbsp;(67 percent) wants its TV, hold the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The novelty value of commercials a quarter-century ago kept this&nbsp;percentage (of people who want commercial-free TV) down,&quot; reports Video&nbsp;Storyboard Tests Commercial Break newsletter. &quot;But the novelty has all&nbsp;since evaporated and viewer complaints about commercial clutter have&nbsp;progressively grown. Older age groups, in particular, have a higher&nbsp;preference for television without commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more disturbing to advertisers, reports the newsletter, more&nbsp;than half of America (54 percent) is willing to pay &quot;a small amount&nbsp;yearly&quot; for TV without commercials, whereas in 1960 less than one in four&nbsp;(24 percent) said they'd pay for commercial-free TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goods news for advertisers: The percentage of people who say&nbsp;they frequently welcome a commercial break (36 percent) has not changed&nbsp;in 30 years; and, while more people want fewer, or no commercials, today&nbsp;more viewers (57 percent, up from 43 percent) believe &quot;some commercials&nbsp;are so good that they are more entertaining than the programs.&quot;; Back again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to the title of his book, &quot;Against Gravity,&quot; adman Ed McCabe&nbsp;has quit Miami advertisng agency Beber Silverstein &amp; Partners, and&nbsp;returned to New York, after only eight months on a quest to build the&nbsp;Miami agency into a powerhouse like his first shop, New York agency,&nbsp;Scali, McCabe, Sloves. Mr. McCabe - variously described during his 30-&nbsp;year career as brilliant, cryptic and abusive - said he'd been toying&nbsp;with the idea of leaving Beber for a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found myself facing the opportunity to do things my own way, and&nbsp;I had to take it,&quot; he told Adweek magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine reports most of Miami's advertising community won't&nbsp;miss him, because it wasn't terribly bowled over by McCabe in the first&nbsp;place. Though he's the youngest copywriter ever to be installed in the&nbsp;Advertising Hall of Fame (at age 35), he wasn't the rain maker he was&nbsp;expected to be. &quot;The copywriter produced only a few scattered showers,&quot;&nbsp;the magazine reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCabe, who could not be reached for comment, is opening his own&nbsp;New York shop, McCabe &amp; Co., and reportedly is pursuing the $ 40-million&nbsp;Volvo account which his first agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves, was forced&nbsp;to resign last month over a faked commercial scandal that rocked the&nbsp;industry.; Quickly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Osterman has been named the new editor of Adweek magazine's&nbsp;Southeastern edition, replacing Martha Nolan, who left to pursue&nbsp;freelance writing. Mr. Osterman joined the magazine in 1984 as a reporter&nbsp;and rose to managing editor in 1988.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia basketball coach Hugh Durham may make less than athletics&nbsp;director Vince Dooley, but when it comes to shoe contracts, Durham's the&nbsp;top Dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to documents obtained by The Journal-Constitution, Durham&nbsp;was paid a salary of $ 75,000 by Georgia in the 1986-87 basketball season.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the '86 football season, Dooley, who was football coach and athletics&nbsp;director at the time, had a base salary of $ 95,000. Other income greatly&nbsp;increased the total packages of both men - Dooley's to $ 374,497.89,&nbsp;Durham's to $ 255,100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both also had shoe contracts with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Dooley's called for a&nbsp;$ 30,000 endorsement fee, plus $ 2,000 in merchandise. Durham's called for&nbsp;a $ 35,000 endorsement fee, plus $ 1,500 in merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a basic contract all coaches associated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have,&quot;&nbsp;Durham said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has about 60 or 70 coaches. It's a quite comprehensive&nbsp;document. It's not like they're dealing with one person; they're dealing&nbsp;with 60 or 70.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional benefits include $ 5,000 worth (wholesale value) of&nbsp;merchandise for Durham to use at his camps and clinics, $ 1,500 worth&nbsp;(retail value) of goods for his personal use, $ 300 in merchandise for&nbsp;each of three assistants and 135 pairs of shoes for his team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, Durham wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes and sportswear exclusively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to figures provided two years ago by Durham's attorney,&nbsp;Nick Chilivis, Durham also earned $ 3,000 from a basketball contract with&nbsp;MacGregor and $ 1,500 from a uniform manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's basketball coach Andy Landers made a base salary of $ 45,000&nbsp;for the '86-87 season, but added only $ 9,500 in outside income, for a&nbsp;total package of $ 54,500.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omni president/general manager Bob Dhue, citing competition from the&nbsp;Lakewood Amphitheater and the impending opening of the Georgia Dome in&nbsp;1992, has proposed a major renovation of the 18-year-old arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a presentation to the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority&nbsp;this week, Dhue outlined improvements and suggested bonds be approved to&nbsp;finance construction, since The Omni stands on public property. He&nbsp;emphasized The Omni would be responsible for the debt service and&nbsp;estimated the cost at between $ 3 million and $ 5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With recreation authority approval, construction could start as&nbsp;early as this summer and be complete well before the Georgia Dome opens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the proposals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Convert interior concession stands to box suites, increasing the&nbsp;number from 12 to 32;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Knock out segments of the exterior walls and rebuild affected&nbsp;concession stands;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Double the restroom area;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Widen the concourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhue said expansion of seating capacity from the current 16,600 was&nbsp;considered, but it was deemed unnecessary because the average attendance&nbsp;for 180 to 200 events per year is 11,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be competitive, we need to update,&quot; Dhue said. &quot;The Georgia Dome&nbsp;people have said they'd like to host college basketball games, SEC, ACC&nbsp;and NCAA tournaments, and as many as 12 rock concerts per year. Those&nbsp;aren't new events. We've hosted all those events, so we'd like to be at&nbsp;speed when the Dome opens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BON APPETIT: The Braves haven't wasted any time formulating plans&nbsp;under new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general manager John Schuerholz's orders to improve food quality at&nbsp;Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium this season. A new food court to be located&nbsp;along the gates nearest home plate will feature for the first time fried&nbsp;and grilled chicken, french fries, grilled hamburgers and Italian&nbsp;sausage. There also will be a Beers of the World stand featuring imports&nbsp;in addition to the domestics available elsewhere in the stadium. . . .&nbsp;&quot;Being a Braves fan isn't the toughest thing about living in Atlanta,&quot;&nbsp;says Ron Snyder, vice president for sports sales and marketing for TBS.&nbsp;&quot;Selling advertising to Braves games is tougher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOOTING THE BILL: Georgia's Andy Landers was the nation's first&nbsp;women's basketball coach to get a shoe contract after the Lady Bulldogs&nbsp;won the NIT in 1981. Previously, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - acting on a suggestion from men's&nbsp;basketball coach Hugh Durham - provided Landers's team with 48 pairs of&nbsp;shoes annually. When Converse offered Landers $ 2,000 plus shoes for the&nbsp;season following the NIT, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> matched it. Landers now receives over more&nbsp;than $ 12,000 per year, FROM from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including $ 2,000 in merchandise,&nbsp;from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, plus shoes for his team. . . . Anheuser-Busch has reached a $ 5&nbsp;million agreement with the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as the&nbsp;organization's exclusive &quot;malt beverage&quot; - not beer - sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIGH ON SPORTS: The High Museum is seeking a $ 125,000 sponsor for&nbsp;&quot;The Sporting Life,&quot; an exhibition of 155 sports images spanning 125&nbsp;years scheduled for May 16-Sept. 13, 1992. It's the first major exhibit&nbsp;surveying the relationships between photography, sports and culture in&nbsp;the U.S., Europe and the Soviet Union. The exhibit also is scheduled for&nbsp;Springfield, Mass., Wilmington, Del., Buffalo and, tentatively,&nbsp;Indianapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLOCKBUSTER DEALS: &quot;A lot of people thought we were crazy to create&nbsp;what was then the 19th bowl game,&quot; says Richard Giannini, president of&nbsp;the Raycom Management Group. But the numbers are in and Raycom is&nbsp;certifiably sane: The Blockbuster Bowl will pay $ 1.6 million each to&nbsp;Florida State and Penn State, sixth-largest per-team payout this year. It&nbsp;had the seventh-highest TV rating, beating three New Year's Day games,&nbsp;and the fourth-largest crowd among all bowls. The crowd also was the&nbsp;second-largest ever at Joe Robbie Stadium behind the 1989 Super Bowl. . .&nbsp;. Blockbuster Video CEO Wayne Huizenga recently completed a stock&nbsp;manuever with Merrill Lynch geared toward raising capital to bring a&nbsp;major league baseball franchise to the Miami area. If, as Huizenga&nbsp;expects, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Denver get the two expansion franchises&nbsp;now up for grabs, he would like to buy the Pittsburgh Pirates - at a&nbsp;price of $ 100 million to $ 140 million, including as much as $ 50 million in</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coach shouldn't worry about losing money if his school takes over&nbsp;negotiating his outside-income contract, according to NCAA executive&nbsp;director Dick Schultz, who handled that chore for his staff when he was&nbsp;athletics director at Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our coaches made more money because I was a better negotiator than&nbsp;they were,&quot; Schultz said at the NCAA's recent annual football forum in&nbsp;Kansas City, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schultz said Virginia in 1982 became the first school to turn the&nbsp;negotiating of coaches' TV/radio contracts and other deals over to the&nbsp;athletics department. Other schools using the practice include Clemson,&nbsp;Florida State, Florida and Kentucky.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletics director Vince Dooley is instituting a similar policy at&nbsp;Georgia and strongly hinted that it would be expanded to include shoe&nbsp;contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schultz and Dooley predict the consolidation of outside-income&nbsp;contracts will become a national trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The college presidents feel more comfortable with it coming under&nbsp;the university and the control of the athletics department,&quot; Dooley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schultz said Virginia had contracts with three shoe manufacturers,&nbsp;and teams other than football and basketball benefited from those&nbsp;contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia basketball coach Hugh Durham is paid $ 40,000 annually for&nbsp;endorsing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes and $ 40,000 to do speeches and clinics for the shoe&nbsp;company - plus $ 2,000 in merchandise. Football coach Ray Goff last year&nbsp;received $ 21,250 from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PENTLAND, the British sports-goods firm, is set to negotiate a lucrative contractto arrange the to manufacture of Adidas sportswear products in the Far East following its move to buy a 20% stake in the German giant from Bernard Tapie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal could revitalise the fortunes of Adidas and enable it to catch up recover some of the ground that has been lost to its two American arch-rivals, Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Paris financiers expect Pentland's Pounds 47m Adidas investment to lead to it taking control of Adidas next summer when Tapie faces his next financial crunch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime Pentland, famous for its role in which made its mark pushing Reebok to the top of the sports footwear league table, will focus its efforts on securing a lucrative sourcing contract in the Far East with Adidas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hopes the contract will mirror the long-term deal with Reebok that played a key role in the footwear company's ''miracle turnround'' in the 1980s, when it caught up with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earning Pentland Pounds 6m profit last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adidas lost out in the cut-throat battle with Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as because it was slow to follow them into the Far East. Today 85% of the West German giant's shoes are made in the Far East but Pentland's expertise in this area should be able to cut costs further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Pentland, whose brands include Pony and Speedo, the attraction is that net margins at Adidas are only one and a half percent 112% compared with 10% at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok. If they can sort out the Adidas sourcing, profits at Adidas could explode from the current Pounds 19m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's decision to terminate the sourcing contract with Pentland was a key factor that persuaded the British firm to sell part of its stake for Pounds 200m. Today with Reebok shares riding high at $32, Pentland may soon sell its remaining 13% stake, which is worth another Pounds 222m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sourcing contract is the icing on the cake but Pentland does not hide its ambition to own Adidas. The chance could come next summer when Tapie will have to must find another Pounds 160m to finance the second part of the Adidas purchase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONSUMERS, political activists and labor unions have adopted a new goal for anold strategy: They are boycotting companies with an eye toward the corporations' image, and not just their bottom line.  Because effectively mounted boycotts can derail marketing strategies and drain employee morale, as well as damage fragile corporate reputations, business executives now seem anxious to resolve disputes with boycotters.  But as companies capitulate, they may be encouraging even more groups to engage in this form of protest.  Corporate executives once tried to ignore consumer boycotts, but they are finding it a lot harder to do so now.  ''In the past,'' says Todd Putnam, the editor of the independent National Boycott News, ''it seemed like it would take years for a company to acknowledge or even recognize that it was being boycotted. Now it seems like you even say the word 'boycott' and people in the board room jump.'' There has been a lot of jumping in recent months. For example: In November, McDonald's Corp. gave in to the growing environmental sensitivities of its customers and announced that it would scrap its hard-to-recycle plastic-foam food containers.  Not long before that, when angry sports-bar owners threatened to boycott Miller beer and the products of several other leading sponsors of network television sports broadcasts, NBC and CBS shelved their plans to scramble satellite transmissions of professional football games.  Last April, three tuna companies, fighting an extended boycott, announced they would stop buying tuna caught in nets that also snared dolphins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other recent corporate capitulations show how willing business leaders have been to respond to consumer boycotts - especially when such protests threaten their corporation's public image and marketing strategies.  ''A company's reputation is a critical ingredient in any product it makes,'' says D. Edward I. Smyth, vice president for corporate affairs at the H.J. Heinz Co., the parent corporation of StarKist. StarKist was the first seafood company to announce that it would make its tuna ''dolphin-safe.'' A growing number of groups are using boycotts to promote social change.  Putnam estimates that more than 150 groups around the country are engaged in 200 to 250 national consumer boycotts. This is about twice the number of boycotts Putnam's newsletter was tracking a year ago.  ''I don't know if there have been this many boycotts ... since the 1920s and 1930s, when (union organizing efforts were still going on,'' Putnam says.  Boycotts have been used by both anti-abortion and abortion-rights organizations, sometimes against the same companies but for different reasons.  Animal rights activists used boycotts to persuade major cosmetic manufacturers to stop testing the safety of their products on laboratory animals. And a number of organizations have boycotted firms that do business in countries with dubious human rights records, including South Africa and El Salvador.  But most of the recent boycott boom can be attributed to environmental groups.  ''The reality is that, in ever greater numbers, consumers want environmentally safe products, packaging and processing,'' Smyth says.  ''The polls tell us that ... nearly 30 percent of consumers claim to have boycotted a company's products because of its environmental policies.'' Putnam attributes the growing number of boycotts in part to Americans' lack of faith in the legislative process. ''Boycotts are really a form of grass-roots democracy,'' he says. They offer ''a way to bypass the legislative process when you think that your elected representatives aren't going to represent you on this issue or that issue.'' But boycotts are not always successful. Sometimes companies fight back.  That's what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. did last summer when it became the boycott target of Operation PUSH.  The Chicago-based group has successfully used consumer protests to pressure the Ford Motor Co. and other large corporations into investing more of their earnings in the black community. PUSH leaders say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets black consumers with advertising campaigns that feature prominent African-Americans, like film maker Spike Lee and football/baseball player Bo Jackson, but at the same time fails to provide enough executive opportunities for its black employees.  PUSH leaders also say the company has not invested enough of its revenue in black-owned businesses.  Unlike other PUSH targets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials fought back, accusing the boycott organizers of accepting contributions from Reebok International Ltd., a rival sportswear and athletic shoe manufacturer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials also suggested that the boycott was simply a publicity vehicle for the Rev. Tyrone Crider, who recently replaced Jesse Jackson as director of the 20-year-old group.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did announce that it would adopt a two-year program to promote more minority employees into executive and senior management positions, including the company's first minority vice president and its first minority board member. But officials emphasized that ''minority'' did not necessarily mean ''black.'' Meanwhile, local civil rights leaders in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hometown of Portland, Ore., defended the company, saying it maintained a plant and outlet stores in predominantly black Portland neighborhoods while other companies were leaving the area.  The way in which a company responds to a boycott depends in large part on how sympathetic a company thinks its customers will be to the boycotters' message.  But boycotts are generally getting harder to ignore, a fact Putnam attributes to the increasing sophistication of the consumer campaigns.  ''Corporations spend millions of dollars every year trying to present a certain type of image,'' Putnam says, ''and if you can somehow damage that image, you are going to indirectly cost the company a lot of money.'' Boycotters who can do that will be taken seriously by a target corporation, says Jerry Johnson, the research director at Powell, Adams &amp; Rinehart, a Washington-based group that is part of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather public relations group.  ''There is an intrinsic desire on the part of a firm to be perceived as doing the right thing,'' Johnson says. ''It's good business.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unethical business practices hurt U.S. productivity, Gov. John D. Ashcroft said Friday in St. Louis.  ''Employees steal $160 billion worth of things from their employers in this country,'' Ashcroft said. ''Time spent stealing is time not spent producing.'' Ashcroft was addressing a conference sponsored by St. Louis University Emerson Electric Center for Business Ethics.  ''Rules have been relaxed in the legal profession,'' Ashcroft said. He said that advertising has permitted lawyers to solicit clients and increase the volume of litigation.  Ashcroft said the country ''needs new heroes.'' Today, he said, people regarded as heroes are those ''who ask the question, 'Is it legal?' - not, 'Is it right?' '' MONSANTO Mahoney Wins Management Award Richard J. Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer of Monsanto Co., was awarded the first Corporate Cultural Diversity Management Award on Friday.  The award was presented by the Business Minority Council of Washington University's John M. Olin School of Business. The award is intended to honor efforts to increase the number of minorities and women within senior management.  ''Monsanto has been at the forefront of creating and implementing management training modules which encourage development of a culturally diverse work force,'' said Robert L. Virgil, dean of Olin School.  NATIONAL RJR NABISCO New Stock Offering Announced RJR Nabisco Inc. announced Friday in New York that it would issue 100 million new shares of common stock at a price of $11.25 apiece.  The food and tobacco conglomerate, which said last month it would sell 75 million shares, said it increased the size of the offering because of ''greater marketplace interest.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier 129-million-share stock issue, made as part of a debt exchange offer, has proved immensely popular on Wall Street. The shares began trading at $5.50 a share on Feb. 1 and have climbed past $11.  The already outstanding stock led the most-active list in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, rising 25 cents to $11.75 a share.  AP </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Avia Sues Rival Over Patent In a battle of athletic shoe rivals, Avia is suing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on claims of patent infringement.  The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Portland, Ore., accuses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of using a cushioning system similar to Avia's ''Cantilever'' technology in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new Air 180 shoes, which sell for $125 a pair.  The lawsuit asks for unspecified damages as well as an injunction to stop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from making and selling Air 180s, which were introduced in a nationwide advertising campaign during this year's Super Bowl.  AP R.H. MACY Aggressive Ad Campai gn Planned R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., shifting gears after a year of financial angst, said Friday it is expanding advertising in an aggressive drive for new business.  The retailer said it was spending $150 million on a television advertising campaign that is kicking off in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area and will reach all of Macy's markets by the beginning of 1992.  The campaign is five times the retailer's $30 million annual budget for television advertising.  AP REVLON INC.  Second Big Asset Sale Held Revlon Inc. said Friday it would issue 40 million shares in its National Health Laboratories subsidiary, the second big asset sale announced by the cosmetics maker this week.  The privately-held Revlon sold an 18 percent stake in National Health Laboratories to the public last year. The new issue will leave Revlon with approximately 42 percent of the stock in the division.  Revlon said in a statement it would use the proceeds of the latest stock sale to reduce its debt load.  Earlier this week, Revlon agreed to sell its Max Factor product lines and Betrix subsidiary in Germany to Procter &amp; Gamble Co.  AP USX CORP.  Two New Issues Begin Trading Two new issues of USX Corp. stock began trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange - one for Marathon Oil Co. and one for the parent company's steel business.  The exchange allowed trading of the shares pending an approval of the split by USX shareholders at a meeting next month in Houston. The move allows the public to decide in which of the company's main businesses to invest.  The proposal calls for each share of USX stock to be converted into one share of Marathon stock and one-fifth of a share of steel stock.  The Marathon Oil stock fell 37 1/2 cents to $29.37 1/2 in NYSE trading Friday. The new steel issue climbed $2.75 to $22.75 on the exchange.  USX stock continues to trade normally, giving investors three ways to trade in the company. USX closed up 75 cents at $33.75.  AP INTERNATIONAL JAPAN GE, Toshiba Form Joint Venture Toshiba Corp. and General Electric Co. have agreed to form a joint venture to import and sell GE appliances in Japan, officials of the two companies said Friday in Tokyo.  GE Appliances Japan, Ltd., will be established in Tokyo next month to import and sell refrigerators, washer-dryers and other large appliances.  GE will contribute 51 percent of the 490 million yen ($3.6 million) in capital and Toshiba will contribute 41 percent. A holding company to be established in Singapore by the two firms will put up the remaining 8 percent.  Asahi News Service</SPAN></P>

Reuters ALLSTATE INSURANCE Auto Insurer Pulling Out Of New Jersey Allstate Insurance Co., one of the largest insurers in New Jersey, announced Monday it intends to withdraw all property and casualty business from the state.  Ed Young, the company's group vice president of auto insurance, attributed the decision to what he called the high cost of operating an auto insurance business in New Jersey.  Young said that in 1990 Allstate lost $72 million on auto insurance in New Jersey, resulting in a $24 million total loss to the company on property and casualty insurance state-wide.

Reuters HANSON PLC Beazer Agrees To $600 Million Merger Construction company Beazer PLC, battered by recession and burdened by debt, has agreed to be acquired by the conglomerate Hanson PLC for $608 million, the companies said Monday.  Together, the companies will be better poised to develop their construction businesses when the economy recovers, their top executives said. Hanson already has considerable interests in the building industry.  Beazer will postpone plans to sell off its European operations. Just last week, the company had detailed plans to spin off those operations for what analysts expected would be at least $606 million.  Beazer said at the time it wanted to concentrate on its U.S. businesses in 30 states.  AP</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a winner. I can hardly wait to see their ad again. It was perfect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I knew from the first frame who it was. Very compelling. And they got three more free commercials from L.A. Gear and Reebok (which alluded to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Another loser was Bud Bowl. I mean, yawn.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Irma Zandl, president of Xtreme, a youth marketing-consulting firm:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most interesting was Master Lock. It showed the product in an interesting way; you had classical music and the harsh reality of this lock. (Lock was shot, rammed with a truck and never broke.) Look how many ads we didn't even know what they were for until the very end. That's a big mistake. The creative drift is to not mention the product's name, to do everything in print. Everyone in the ad business sits around and watches commercials, but real people don't. It's when you go to the bathroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diet Pepsi ads were good because they developed a theme. The Diet Coke ads were terrible. They're really trying to have their cake and eat it, too. It was a dishonest posture - ''We're not going to do this ad, however ...'' They just should've done the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most irritating were the Bud Bowl ads. They've gone too far. Time to go on to something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising people have been looking at too many Infiniti ads. The fuzzy Americana ads - this new-age thing - makes all ads look alike. You can't tell if the Dockers ad was for jeans, or if it was another McDonald's ad. I thought the Audi ad was Infiniti on speed!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear was the most effective shoe ad. It showed the shoe in a high- tech way and it didn't refer to the competition. If you've got 30 seconds, why advertise your competitor?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Phil Lempert, editor of The Lempert Report, a food-marketing newsletter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two major trends: warm and fuzzy, and music. The commercials were geared to baby boomers more than college kids or older Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies that did a special commercial for the Super Bowl made me feel special. That doesn't mean they were good, but they made me feel special that they went to that effort. If somebody's going to spend $ 800,000 for a commercial, spend a little more and somehow customize it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high point was clearly the Ray Charles Diet Pepsi commercial. It was brilliantly done, and every time they added something else. By the end of the Super Bowl, I knew the slogan. I wanted to be Ray Charles. The low point was Coke. It was a cheap shot. They told us: ''We aren't going to do (the promotion), but here it is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad was beautiful. It made believe that they were serious, that the products were good. But by the end of the game, how many people remember that it was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since they've seen four other sneaker (ads) after that? The Reebok Pump came across better. But if they're going to have three commercials they should have three celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Master Lock ad was unbelievable. It was very tacky to have a gun shooting the lock off amid the whole war crisis.  I know what they want to show is that their locks will stand up. It just doesn't work for me.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions surrounding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s future earnings let some air out of its stock Thursday. The maker of Air Jordan and other pricey athletic shoes dropped 4 1/4 to $ 46 5/8 after two analysts scaled back their quarterly and yearly earnings estimates for the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearson Lehman Bros. analyst Josie Esquivel shaved her third-quarter estimate to 92 cents a share from $ 1. For the year ending in May, she cut her estimate to $ 4 a share from $ 4.13. Montgomery Securities analyst Alice Ruth cut her estimate to 95 cents a share from $ 1.10 for the third quarter and to $ 3.85 from $ 4 for the year. Both cited a 33% drop in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''refill'' orders for the third quarter. Refill orders are spot orders from retailers to shore up their inventories.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Esquivel says the soft market for athletic shoes that cost more than $ 100 a pair will be temporary. She ''strongly reiterated'' her buy recommendation. But Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Gary Jacobson says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is facing a period of slow growth. With the slack economy, ''we're beginning to see customers shift away from high-priced footwear to lower priced shoes,'' he says. ''In a tough retail environment, if you have a high-priced item, you'll likely have problems.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recommends shunning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stock in favor of arch-competitor Reebok International, which fell 1/4 to $ 17 5/8 Thursday. He thinks more modestly priced shoes such as Reebok's Freestyle and Princess lines are poised for higher sales in a less ostentatious decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profit-taking Time: Buoyed all week on rumors of an imminent deal to sell portions of its entertainment businesses, Time Warner Inc. lost 4 3/4 to $ 110 3/4 a share as traders took profits. The stock had soared 17 1/2 points (17.9%) since Monday; 43 5/8 points (65%) since Oct. 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Hope springs eternal with Time Warner stock,'' says analyst Peter Appert of Cyrus J. Lawrence. The hope: A deal will surface to help alleviate some of the load of $ 10.6 billion in debt the company is carrying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time Warner has been saying for more than a year that it is talking with potential international and domestic partners who would buy an equity stake in Warner Bros. studio, Home Box Office cable TV channel or its cable TV unit. Speculation is that Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Canal Plus S.A. of France are interested.<BR>- James Kim and Pat Guy</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bo Jackson has been unable to play a single inning of baseball in the '91 season, but he'll still make an appearance during the July 9 All-Star Game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has purchased four minutes of ad time during the prime-time telecast.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for the third year, the shoe company is using the game to premier a new Bo ad campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Past commercials - including the famous ''Bo knows'' - have been award- winners. The new series will kickoff with a 60-second spot that highlights this year's theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is keeping details of the new campaign secret until next week. But this much has leaked: The new spots will have the world's most famous two- sport athlete singing and dancing and will involve several other guest athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson injured his hip last January as an NFL running back for the Los Angeles Raiders. He was released by baseball's Kansas City Royals in spring training, then signed by the Chicago White Sox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the regular season began, Jackson has been working on an intensive rehabilitation program and vows to return to baseball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is expected to remain on the disabled list, though, until August.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shoemaker's new TV ad opens with Bo at the center of the ''Bo Show,'' a Busby Berkeley-style musical with frenetic dancers (in sequined Raiders and White Sox uniforms).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a big band lays down a funky beat, tuxedoed Bo sings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new catchphrase, ''Bo knows it's got that Air thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bo stops the show to proclaim that he's ''an athlete, not an actor.'' He literally crawls out of the TV and gets to work on his rehab program: swimming, spinning on a stationary bike and weight training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show goes on, however, with George Foreman as the star. He leads the dancers in a new verse, ''George knows it's got that Air thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is directed by Joe Pytka, who is responsible for the original ''Bo Knows'' ads. The first installment is due July 9 during baseball's All-Star Game. Other versions of the ''Bo Show'' will run later this summer and feature a new lineup of guest hosts: Wayne Gretzky, Jerry Rice, Darryl Strawberry, Randall Cunningham and Eric Davis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slip into a pair of shoe stocks and you may find your feet heading in opposite directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first quarter, a group of five shoemakers was the fifth best of 87 stock groups tracked by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., rising 41%. But as more consumers repaired their old shoes or bought cheaper ones, shoe stocks fell 9% the second quarter and the group staggered to 81st.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, shoe stocks are hot again. The group is up 14% this month, tops among the S&amp;P stock groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's going on here? Not enough, some analysts fear. They worry growth will slow as consumers scale back the variety of shoes they wear and continue to rebel against high-priced sneakers. Many view shoe stocks as overpriced now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Domestic (shoe) consumption has been declining for a number of quarters,'' says Janet Mangano, publisher of The Johnson Redbook Service. ''The trend is disturbing. It continues to show decline.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers bought 367 million pairs of shoes the first quarter - 3.3% less than the 379 million pairs purchased a year earlier, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department. Manufacturers reduced shipments 12% that quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're not recommending any'' of the shoe stocks, Mangano says flatly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok International, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. and Stride Rite have managed to report good earnings this year. Stride Rite makes the popular - and low priced - Keds line. Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> make expensive sneakers but also have popular low- priced shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two other stocks in the S&amp;P group are dress-shoe makers Genesco Inc. and Brown Group, which have struggled due to the popularity of leisure shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson predicts flat sales for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the coming year. He has a weak hold recommendation on the stock. But he is recommending Reebok. Sales are jumping as result of a strong advertising push, he says. The Pump and Black Top lines are selling well , as are the company's shoes selling for less than $ 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The momentum is behind Reebok,'' he says. ''The Pump has been phenomenal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stride Rite's Keds line is doing well, according to a recent report by Courtney Smith of Pinnacle Capital Management. ''Solid products, excellent distribution and a strong balance sheet'' have positioned the company well for coming years, he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But insiders at Stride Rite may not be so sure. They have been selling stock in recent months - even as the stock advanced. Still, insider selling is an indication the stock may not go up much further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derby Securities analyst Otto Grote doesn't give all shoe stocks the boot. ''The outlook for the family shoe business is pretty good,'' he says. ''There are only so many times you can repair a shoe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Brown Group should benefit from good management even in the face of lower sales. Grote says others, such as Genesco, owner of the Johnston &amp; Murphy shoes stores, are trying to diversify by selling more accessories such as ties and belts.</SPAN></P>

Second-quarter revenue rose 30% over 1990. The company commands 24% of $ 6 billion-a-year athletic -shoe market to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to great ads, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gotten all the airtime. Their star-filled ads are virtual news events and their slogans - from ''Just do it'' to ''Bo knows'' - quickly become buzzwords. Meanwhile, Reebok has suffered a depressing series of gaffes: Its wacky ''U.B.U.'' series flopped and a bungee-jumping ad was yanked last year for implying a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wearer fell to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has known for a long time what they stand for,'' says Dick Sittig, new creative director of ad agency Chiat/Day/<BR>Mojo New York, which lost the account after the bungee spot but won it back this year. ''They've had the advantage of getting a head start.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pump's success lets Reebok present itself as a serious sports shoe. Earlier ads talked form at the expense of performance, says David Ropes, vice president of marketing. ''It's like we were a teenager, we were feeling our oats. We're still a teenager, but now we know what we want to be when we grow up.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Vaccaro's association with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he helped sign college coaches John Thompson (Georgetown), Jerry Tarkanian (Nevada-Las Vegas), Bobby Cremins (Georgia Tech) and Jim Valvano (N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Greenville (S.C.) Spinners haven't played a game - or even finalized their roster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Global Basketball Association team has a novel idea for sports teams looking for new revenues: Instead of just giving career counseling and motivational speeches to your players, make a business out of providing them to your fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the GBA - a new pro league with 11 U.S. franchises - tips off in November, the Spinners hope to have signed up a number of local companies for motivational seminars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They won't be your typical corporate outings. Figuring there's a growing demand for corporate seminars that help develop teamwork and concern for quality, the club will work with a local technical college to provide motivational speakers and career and family counselors. After daytime seminars, workers will attend a Spinners game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spinners coach Joe Williams, who coached at Jacksonville, Furman and Florida State, says seminars will come with a range of options. Companies can opt to have their signs spread along the length of the court at the game that ends their motivational outing. Or let their key employee throw out the first ball at tipoff time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But companies shouldn't get their hopes up too much. Seminar prices vary and are negotiable. But the Spinners top price, for their ''Grand Slam Outing,'' is close to what New York Knicks coach Pat Riley gets for a motivational speech: $ 15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S THE SHOES: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent $ 178.8 million on advertising in 1990, says Advertising Age, which makes the shoemaker the USA's 58th-biggest advertiser. Last year, the trade magazine ranked it 99th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New York State, an advocacy group, thinks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still has something to learn about marketing - at least about showing sensitivity to the mentally ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has criticized a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> magazine ad, featuring San Francisco 49er Jerry Rice. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says the ad refers to Rice following the inspirations of his inner voice, with copy reading ''crazy people talk to themselves. And finally, you realize, only a madman doesn't listen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it won't drop the ad but will cancel billboards for cross- training shoes using athe tagline ''Multiple Personalities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARD BEARER: Jack Nicklaus' Golden Bear International, along with Marine Midland Bank, is introducing a VISA affinity credit card. Along with various golf discounts, users get a Nicklaus golf tip on every monthly statement. ... Coming this Christmas: Cardboard cutouts of CNN sports anchors to help promote a sports video, part of a merchandising push that might result in watches and luggage with the cable network's logo. ... In its biggest promotion, Chrysler will team with K mart and CBS for promotions tied to the 1992 Winter Olympics. Chrysler, reportedly, will spend about $ 50 million for ads on CBS broadcasts. ... Changing times: A new $ 30 Cardillo Cross-Trainer spandex weightlifting belt hopes to compete with traditional leather belts made for heavy lifting. Also, Weslo Inc. of Logan, Utah, is introducing a home treadmill with a VCR hookup to show users Utah's red rock desert as they exercise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMID controversy and angst, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the winged Greek goddess of victory, was hoisted back to the top of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin yesterday in preparation for the monument's 200th birthday celebrations on August 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost destroyed a year and a half ago by joyful souvenir hunters on the first New Year's Eve after the Berlin Wall came down, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her four horses have spent the past 15 months having a Pounds 100,000 renovation to protect her from vandals and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a thousand people turned out yesterday to watch as a crane lowered the copper statue and her chariot on to the 60ft high gate. Typically for modern Germany, however, the return of the goddess has provoked a profound argument about what she ought to symbolise. When she was locked away behind the wall staring eastwards down Unter den Linden at the decaying communist state, the triumphalism she once represented did not matter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a united country, however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> return with Iron Cross and Prussian eagle on her staff, has created worries that she will give the wrong message to the world about German ambitions for the future. Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, has also run into criticism over his plan, announced yesterday, to attend the ceremony taking place in Potsdam on August 17, when the remains of Frederick the Great of Prussia are to be moved. Frau Herta Daubler-Gmelin, deputy chairman of the opposition Social Democrats complained that this would rouse mistrust in Germany's neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar arguments are being roused by the statue of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Two hundred years ago she was designed by Johann Schadow, court sculptor to King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, to represent Irene, the goddess of peace. Napoleon changed all that. When he arrived in the city fresh from his triumph at Jena in 1806 he liked the look of the statue and decided to pack it up and send it back to Paris as part of his booty. The goddess lived in exile for eight years until Field Marshall Blucher secured her release in 1814 after Napoleon's first defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She returned in triumph, not as Irene but as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, complete with cross, oak leaves, and eagle. As such she presided over the victory parades of the Prussians, the German Empire and the Third Reich. In 1945, however, the gate and the statue were badly damaged in the battle for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the scrap and pictures as a model the East German government managed to copy and replace the statue in 1958 without the victory symbols, carefully describing her in the official guidebooks as ''the peace goddess''. Now Friedbert Pfluger, a Christian Democrat Bundestag member from the west German state of Lower Saxony, has started a protest movement about the symbols of victory on her staff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers.  He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of &quot;sky surfing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing.  The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short.  Play Hard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the No.  2 spot and overtake its rival, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sky surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that debuted on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York.  The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology.  The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that for a variety of reasons fell short of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ubiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon.  As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on.  Reebok also last year was caught in a controversy with a campaign that depicted &quot;bungee jumping,&quot; an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Reebok has been labeled a &quot;revolving door&quot; client by ad agencies.  The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bungee jumping ad.  Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day.  Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past.  But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reebok has been like a teenager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign.  &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things.  Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the campaign works, stock analysts expect it to move Reebok closer to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the $ 5.6 billion athletic shoe market.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year controlled 27 per cent to Reebok's 22 per cent of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok has been demonstrating strong financial performance in the midst of a recession.  Second-quarter earnings were better than expected, rising 39 per cent to $ 60.3 million U.S., or 64 cents a share, from $ 43.3 million, or 38 cents, in the year-earlier period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales for the quarter, boosted by the success of the Pump line of shoes, rose 30 percent to $ 688 million, from $ 527 million in the same period of 1990.  Cost-cutting efforts also impressed analysts, several of whom noted that Fireman's pay cut saved the company $ 2 million in the second-quarter alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok also is expected to benefit from the corporate implosion of L.A.  Gear Inc., a competitive upstart that recently announced it has entered an agreement with its bankers to avoid loan foreclosures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE Reebok International Ltd. started selling its Pump basketball shoe 18 months ago, the company has shipped four million pairs of the inflatable sneakers. Pump sales alone have reached $500 million, a figure that would make the Pump the fourth-largest athletic shoe company in the United States if it were a separate company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using savvy marketing and sports star endorsements, Reebok, No. 2 after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the highly competitive athletic footwear market, is riding the Pump to what industry analysts say is the beginning of a new surge. The company had been stuck on a three-year treadmill after a spectacular rise in the mid-1980's. Profits were basically flat from 1987 to 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990 Reebok, based in Stoughton, near Boston, shipped 75 million pairs of athletic shoes worldwide and saw revenues grow by more than 18 percent, to $2.2 billion. Analysts predict that will increase to $2.6 billion this year on the strength of innovative products and a growing international business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company officials and financial analysts point to the Pump as the main force in the turnaround. &quot;The Pump gives them a foundation for their marketing,&quot; said Alice Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pump has an air bladder built into the upper portion of the shoe. Pumping a small button on the tongue inflates the bladder and helps the shoe conform to the shape of the wearer's foot. A small valve at the back of the shoe lets the air out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok now sells nine categories of Pump shoes, including ones for golf, aerobics and tennis, at prices of $95 to $110. The company is planning to offer cleated pumps for baseball and soccer. A Reebok spokesman said Roger Clemens, the Boston Red Sox pitcher, wore a pair of prototype baseball Pumps in a recent game at Fenway Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;High tech&quot; shoes like the Pump and the new Catapult by L. A. Gear have been criticized lately as more expensive fashion statements than well-made, well-fitting and high-performance shoes. But many teen-agers and weekend athletes recall scenes like those provided by Dee Brown, the Boston Celtics rookie, who won the Slam Dunk competition this year, held in conjunction with the N.B.A. All-Star game. Before each run-up to the basket to stuff the ball through the hoop, he reached down and inflated his Reebok Pumps, which the company pays him to wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Reebok knew nothing of his plans to pump his Pumps, but the show he put on helped crystallize what the marketing of the technology has meant for Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts project another surge for Reebok this year. Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, estimates earnings of $2.05 a share this year and $2.60 in 1992, up from $1.54 in 1990. Mr. Jacobson and Ms. Ruth rate Reebok stock as a strong &quot;buy.&quot; They think it could sell in the $30-a-share range by the end of the year. The stock closed yesterday at $23.125, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company is doing a number of things right,&quot; Mr. Jacobson said. &quot;The Pump continues to gain market share; they are introducing strong new casual and fashion lines; their apparel line is ready to explode, and international is showing 50 percent-plus growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's biggest concern, analysts say, is soft retail sales for athletic footwear. &quot;The athletic footwear segment is mature,&quot; Ms. Ruth said, &quot;which makes this more a market-share game than it ever has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Reebok is making money by gaining market share, analysts said. The company is reportedly cutting into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lead, though analysts do not expect it to overtake </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soon. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holds 30 percent of the market and Reebok 24 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Duncan, Reebok's chief financial officer, said the company was not focused on passing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,&quot; said Mr. Duncan, who has a shelf of caps labeled &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-buster&quot; in his office. &quot;We are a marketing company. We build brands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok recently introduced the Blacktop, a new basketball shoe aimed at outdoor hoop enthusiasts. The shoe is lightweight, but has thicker and stronger soles than other basketball shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sneaker business generally is more sizzle than steak,&quot; said Steven Frankel, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. &quot;But the Blacktop has some real steak to it. It's innovative and the competition doesn't have it.&quot; By March, Blacktop orders were at 1.5 million pairs, an exceptional start for a new product, Ms. Ruth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1986, Reebok has acquired four companies with high-quality brand names. By buying Avia and Ellesse, two athletic footwear competitors, along with Rockport shoes and the Boston Whaler boat maker, Reebok hopes to broaden its image beyond footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Boston Whaler is not yet profitable and Avia is trying to overcome some problems, Ellesse and Rockport are adding substantially to Reebok's bottom line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok, which made its initial splash and fortune with aerobic shoes, is trying to revitalize that niche with its Step Reebok program. Based on a relatively new exercise program called low-impact aerobics that uses a step stool (which Reebok also sells), the company is betting that a grass-roots interest in step aerobics will emerge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent summers, men have headed to the beach clad in snug bikini trunks, feet bare or shod in loose-fitting flip-flops. But in the summer of 1991, snug trunks are outnumbered by loose-fitting briefs. And it's the new beach shoes of choice that are worn snug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aqua Gear collection of coordinated swimwear and water sport shoes has kept fashion and sales pace with the increased popularity of sports like wind surfing and wave running (the latter refers to riding a water vehicle that looks like a snowmobile). These sports call for steady footing and, of course, the pulled-together bearing that matching shorts and shoes imply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aqua Socks, actually slip-on shoes, consist of neoprene soles with treads, built-in arch support and reinforced toes and molded heels, with ankle-high uppers of an airy spandex mesh in flashy neon colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, they're not worn just by the sports-minded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aqua Socks protect feet from hot sand, sharp shells and glass, and give traction on mucky lake bottoms and slippery rocks. In Central Park, they're worn by young men scaling the outcroppings on mountain bikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have caught on at health clubs, especially in aqua aerobics classes, and in locker rooms, to prevent foot infections. And they're comfortable. A man in a business suit was recently spotted wearing a pair while walking along Park Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am constantly sold out,&quot; Robert Ottofaro, owner of Panda Sport, 311 77th Street in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, said of Aqua Socks. &quot;The foot can't breathe in most activewear shoes,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;your feet do not get fatigued, as in flip-flops, where there is no support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baby Aqua Socks, in sizes 2 through 8, and youth and junior sizes are $25; adult Aqua Socks are $29; Aqua Socks, Too -- with a Velcro closure over the instep for extra support -- are $35. All come in vivid color combinations that complement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> equally colorful Aqua Shorts, in wave-textured nylon taffeta, $36. A Du Pont Coolmax liner wicks away perspiration, and mesh pockets allow drainage. Aqua Gear is sold at Paragon Sporting Goods, 867 Broadway (18th Street) and at Foot Locker stores around the New York region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speedo America also makes a popular beach shoe and nylon swim shorts. The shorts come in 15-, 16- and 17-inch lengths, with mesh pockets and drawstring waistbands, in a variety of colors and prints. All are $36 at Paragon, Macy's, A. &amp; S., Bloomingdale's and the six Herman's World of Sporting Goods stores in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speedo's Surf Walker comes in high- and low-top versions, for children and adults. The high top comes in black or turquoise, $40. The ankle-high slipper comes in two-tone black and turquoise or black and yellow, $34. Children's sizes start at 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-top Surf Walker is somewhat denser and more structured than Aqua Socks and offers less ventilation. A popular boating shoe, it offers support and durability. The molded insole is removable for easy cleaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH Bo Jackson sidelined, marketing experts have been wondering who will replace him as the best pitchman in advertising. Some believe the next superstar endorser is David Robinson. David knows basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robinson, the 7-foot 1-inch center for the San Antonio Spurs, is already the stuff of legend, a rare professional athlete whose basketball scores (25.6 points a game on average) were rivaled, relatively speaking, by his Scholastic Aptitude Test scores (1,320 out of 1,600).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A mathematics major at the United States Naval Academy, Mr. Robinson served a two-year hitch with the Navy, remains a lieutenant and civil engineer in the Reserves, won a bronze medal as a member of the 1988 United States Olympic basketball team, is a concert pianist and in 1990 was voted the National Basketball Association's rookie of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers are always searching for the next great endorser, in hopes that the celebrity's aura will lend a magic glow to their product or service. There are those who say Mr. Robinson's future is limitless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think without a doubt David Robinson has superstar qualities,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, the director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago firm that matches athletes with advertising agencies. &quot;Very often, when an agency calls us, they'll not know who they want, and we'll always recommend Robinson and they'll say, 'Oh, yeah!' And if the agency has already been reviewing basketball stars, Robinson's name is always on the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was still in the Navy, Mr. Robinson signed endorsement contracts with Casio watches and Franklin Sports Industries. He also signed with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the athletic shoe company that made &quot;Bo knows&quot; part of the American vernacular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lured Mr. Robinson into a five-year, $1 million endorsement deal in 1988, before he joined the Spurs. A year ago, the company inaugurated a $15 million advertising campaign for its Force basketball shoe line, with the giant center as the star of &quot;Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood,&quot; a parody of the children's show &quot;Mister Rogers's Neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only is David Robinson what some people consider the future of basketball -- a big man who's incredibly fast -- but he's also an exceptionally wonderful human being,&quot; said Jim Riswold, an associate creative director at Wieden &amp; Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., advertising agency that handles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I walked out of my first meeting with him a couple of years ago, it was his niceness that impressed me,&quot; Mr. Riswold said. &quot;Michael Prieve, an agency art director, agreed and suggested that there was nobody nicer than children's show hosts. We built from there, and that's what you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each of the dozen or so spots Wieden &amp; Kennedy has filmed, Mr. Robinson invites the audience, and sometimes a guest star, into his realm -- the basketball court -- to learn a new word or phrase. When Charles Barkley, the obstreperous forward of the Philadelphia 76er's, was the guest, Mr. Robinson asked, &quot;Can you say, 'Fined?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercials have not been without controversy. Last year, after viewer complaints, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> canceled an ad that ran during the World Series in which Mr. Robinson asked, &quot;Can you say, 'Kick some butt?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Austin, a vice president of Advantage International and Mr. Robinson's agent, said the Spurs' center recently signed two other large endorsement contracts, but declined to identify the companies involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Lanktree, the sports marketing executive, said Mr. Robinson's allure was based partly on intangible factors. &quot;You're talking about a young man, a concert pianist, 1,300 S.A.T. scores, and he still thanks his coaches for teaching him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Lanktree also noted that Mr. Robinson was benefiting from canny marketing by the N.B.A. itself, which has moved to broaden pro basketball's somewhat elitist image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten years ago, the N.B.A. was a spectator sport that rich people went to see,&quot; Ms. Lanktree said. &quot;Now the general public is getting to know it and its stars, like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, and they're giving the game more mass appeal. David Robinson is in on the ground floor of its growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all that, there are still those who say it will be hard for Mr. Robinson to achieve Bo Jackson's level as an endorser. Mr. Jackson reportedly earned about $2 million a year from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and $3 million from A.T.&amp;T., Pepsico and other companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin E. Blackman, whose New York firm, Blackman &amp; Raber, is a top matchmaker between athletes and advertisers, said Mr. Robinson would suffer from his prowess in just one sport and his team's location in the Southwest. He will not receive &quot;year-round ink,&quot; as Mr. Jackson, a two-sport man, did; nor will he receive heavy coverage in a media center, as Mr. Jackson, who played football for the Los Angeles Raiders, did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you talk in terms of advertising in this country, you're talking about New York and Chicago, where the big agencies are,&quot; Mr. Blackman said. &quot;L.A. also gets exposure. Michael Jordan playing basketball for the Chicago Bulls; it doesn't hurt that McDonald's ad agency, Leo Burnett, is there. And Michael Jordan is doing a big thing for McDonald's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe David Robinson will become a leading product spokesperson, because he's got what it takes,&quot; Mr. Blackman concluded. &quot;But I don't see him yet in the sphere of Michael Jordan or Bo Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robinson's agent, Mr. Austin, is not worried. &quot;David does not necessarily want his name on 50 products,&quot; he said. &quot;That approach is appropriate for Mary Lou Retton, whose celebrity is more of-the-moment. David is going to have longevity.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiat/Day/Mojo in New York has regained a large part of the Reebok International account after the sport-shoe company abruptly pulled its $US40 million account from Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business will be split between Chiat/Day/Mojo and Lois/GGK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok would not comment on its reasons for dismissing Hill, Holiday, a move that comes a little less than a year after the Boston agency won the account in a highly publicised review.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But agency executives said Reebok had made the move because Hill, Holiday's ads failed to create excitement for the company's athletic shoes or to gain ground on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which is number one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives at Hill, Holiday would not comment. The agency had produced only one big campaign for Reebok. With the tag-line &quot;It's time to play&quot;, the ads showed athletes and others playing in their Reeboks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some agency executives said Reebok had become desperate to find a hardhitting campaign to use against the comparative ads from some of its competitors, and it turned to Lois/GGK late last year to produce commercials for its &quot;pump&quot; shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign from Lois/GGK, called &quot;Pump up and Air out&quot;, featured athletes taking a swipe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association, and the maker's Air Jordan shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign was criticised by its competitors and some agency executives because it took what they said was an unwarranted pot-shot at Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bernadette Mansur, a spokeswoman for Reebok, said the company was pleased with the ads from Lois/GGK. &quot;They created a buzz about Reebok with retailers and consumers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Chiat/Day had resigned the bulk of the Reebok account in January 1990 after it was put in review, the agency has continued to create advertising for the company's Weeboks children's shoes and for its business outside the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency executives said Reebok was a difficult client. The said the company demanded innovative approaches but then often criticised an agency for &quot;being too creative&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiat/Day, which had the entire Reebok account for three years before the bulk of it went to Hill, Holiday, lost the account in large part because of its quirky &quot;Reebok lets UBU&quot; campaign, which Reebok executives reportedly thought was too far out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercials showed people doing idiosyncratic things such as vacuuming a carpet on a lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads were criticised within the advertising industry for not focusing on the performance of the athletic shoes and for not increasing sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Chiat/Day had the account, Reebok lost its number one position to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiat/Day handles the pan-European Reebok business out of its London office, and South-East Asian business from Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Reebok is back, Mr Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive world-wide of Chiat/Day/Mojo, said he was pleased. &quot;It's great,&quot; he said. &quot;Clients don't often return to an agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok is the latest in a number of clients who have split their accounts between agencies to double their chances of getting good work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few years both Burger King and IBM have divided their business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this set-up could obviously foster competitive rivalries, Mr George Lois, the chairman and chief executive of Lois/GGK, said he was not worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no reason we can't be a great team,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's official. Well almost. Half the tennis world thinks Andre Agassi is an irrepressible, lovable brat; the other half finds him an insufferable little prat. Or, in the local south London vernacular, a plonker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent national TV poll in the US, he topped the polls for both the most popular and least popular person playing tennis today. That should surprise no-one: Andre is, by his own admission, a kinda crazy, mixed-up guy, drooled over by teenyboppers, damned by the traditionalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love him or loathe him, as they always seem to be saying of Andre, many people were counting on being able to ignore him and his hype this week at Wimbledon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alas, it has not been possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brat is back-four years, almost to the day, since being sent from SW19 after a humiliating straight-sets defeat by Henri Leconte. Between times, Agassi has won 12 tour titles (although, significantly, no grand slam yet), established himself as one of the world's top players on clay, and risen to fifth overall, with prize money to date of more than $A6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While doing so, he has repeatedly declined to play Wimbledon, saying he needed a rest and, anyway, his style of play was not suited to the faster grass courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, aged 21, he returns, not much more mature, but a considerably improved player and infinitely more marketable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose clothing he wears (sometimes he seems to wear them all at once, in clashing Technicolor) as part of a deal worth more than $A5 million a year. Marketing boss Ian Hamilton says Agassi is the company's biggest asset these days, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McEnroe notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, just ask the kids selling postcards from a kiosk in front of the All England Club; they confirm that Agassi portraits have been outselling pix of all the girls put together this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that the buyers tend to be female and under 14, Agassi has become a megastar, albeit one whose court performances are still trying to catch up with his razzle-dazzle showbiz persona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, just as the Fawlty Towers waiter Manuel was explained away as being &quot;from Barcelona&quot;, so Andre Agassi is &quot;from Las Vegas&quot;. As The Times remarked rather sniffily, this is not a good introduction to the real world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Agassi spends much time there. As he says in a typically brash, brainless TV commercial for camera company Canon, &quot;Image is everything&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, all this week, in a series of newspaper articles, he has sought to shock with &quot;revelations&quot; of his teenage rebelliousness. They seem pretty innocuous, in fact. Like many All American boys, Agassi did a little pot, drank a lot of Jack Daniels and, in an attempt to upset his teachers, grew his hair long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays, he insists, the length of every flowing, multi-coloured hair on that treasured head is stipulated in his sponsorship contracts. And the mainstays in his life are not drink and drugs but God, two Porsches, a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, and a cockatoo named Fred (although not necessarily in that order, one suspects).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Agassi really believes his own publicity is doubtful. While publicly he wants to be a hard-assed rad dude, privately he is more Ninja Turtle: not exactly self-effacing but less vulgar, more vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, the man-child who enjoyed the recent French Open so much he pronounced himself &quot;as happy as a faggot in a submarine&quot; has come to Wimbledon anxious not to upset the strawberry cart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics recall with horror how a year ago he clashed with the International Tennis Federation over the dress code, calling its chief, Phillipe Chatrier, a bozo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now transpires that months ago he and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boss Hamilton reassured the All England Club that Agassi, if he played at Wimbledon, would not turn up looking like a mad dog's dinner. Of possible clashes with the Establishment over his clothes, he demurely explained: &quot;I have no trouble with the traditions of Wimbledon. They will not inconvenience me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitably, the crowd that waited almost four days to see his first-round, rain-delayed match against Canada's Grant Connell were interested less in how he would play, more in what he would wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before 4pm on day four he swept on to centre court, whiter than white. So deferential was his demeanour he even bowed to the royal box. The rest was hysteria: Wimbledon welcomed Agassi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, at least, it had decided he was the most popular man in tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the short time he was on court before further showers had him running for cover, he demonstrated that somewhere inside the floppy shirt, denim shorts and Lycra pants (be they white or kaleidoscopically wacky) is an exciting and extravagantly skilled player. He's no net rusher, that's for sure, but his powerful ground shots, hit with wicked top spin, are complemented by pace and inventiveness about the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his inexperience on grass, he was expected to struggle early against the left-handed Connell, ranked 73rd in the world, but who this month had beaten Ivan Lendl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it proved. Though having promised further sartorial surprises in subsequent appearances, Agassi had every incentive to progress to later rounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEN McKENDRY has sprung one of the surprises of the season by recommending temperamental Heidelberg winger Angie Goutzioulis to national coach Eddie Thomson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goutzioulis has earned three weeks of suspension from bookings and landed an extra week after being sent off early in the game against Wollongong City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But McKendry retained his belief in the player's ability and was justly rewarded when he turned on a match winning performance against Marconi on Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McKendry said Goutzioulis tore apart Marconi full-back Robert Wheatley and was instrumental in Heidelberg's upset 1-0 win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I prefer to describe Angie as highly-spirited rather than difficult to handle, and there is no doubting he is a tremendous prospect,&quot; McKendry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's got a bad name unnecessarily and I'm trying to convince Eddie Thomson to have a closer look at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Certainly for us on Sunday, he was given a defensive job as well as going forward, and he did marvellously for us in both areas.&quot; Goutzioulis admitted yesterday that the coach had a quiet word after his sending off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Aggression is part of my game but I'm not temperamental,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would like to think I have matured with the bad experience and believe I can play with contained aggression from now on.&quot; Goutzioulis' performance earns him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weekly winner receives a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners valued at $280.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of season winner collects $2000 cash from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than talk about his performance, Goutzioulis prefers to concentrate on the improving form of Heidelberg and has confidently predicted the side can collect another big scalp - that of Melbourne Croatia - this Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's the first time in 20 weeks that we are at full strength and I really fancy our chances,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goutzioulis broke into the NSL as a central striker, but says he is enjoying his role as a wide player more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've got a bit of defensive work to do, but playing wide allows to run at players and that suits my game a lot more.&quot; ERNIE TAPAI, recovering from a knee operation, has given himself an outside chance of returning to on-field action providing Adelaide City makes the championship play-offs. Tapai, who has been concentrating on swimming in his rehabilitiation program, has resumed light running with the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT'S A few months too late, but Heidelberg will finally acknowledge its players' achievement for winning the 1990 State League championship by holding a celebration dinner for team members at the Lexicon restaurant on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALAN DAVIDSON'S return to international soccer may well be in jeopardy with his decision to postpone indefinitely the operation he needs to repair knee ligaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davidson was told by Socceroo doctor Siri Kanangara to book in for the operation, but the utility has delayed it for several weeks to help out Melbourne Croatia. He has now decided to postpone surgery until the end of the season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've put it on hold and will get it done when I can (after the season),&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;We have had a lot of injuries and suspensions and I agreed to delay it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The club knows I could break down any time or, providing I'm lucky, I could go right through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson's operation will rule him out for up to five weeks and, if he was to have it immediately after the league campaign, it would virtually rule him out of international commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He may delay it further but at this stage he doesn't want to think that far ahead. The media hailed Davidson's performance on the weekend as his best club game for several seasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staid Wimbledon set for fashion sensation London FORGET the tennis one of the most constantly asked questions as the countdown to Wimbledon hits top gear is: &quot;Just what will Andre Agassi be wearing?&quot; Not since Gussie Moran outraged the establishment with her lace pants in 1949 has fashion been so prominent in pre-Wimbledon discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Agassi licks his wounds over losing last week's French Open final to fellow American Jim Courier, it seems almost everyone else is licking their lips in anticipation of what the luminous lad from Las Vegas will turn out in when he makes his much-anticipated Wimbledon return in 11 days. During this year's Parisian sojourn Agassi followed up his lava pink outfit of 1990 by bustling around the red clay courts of Roland Garros in a black, purple and white combination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ensemble is certainly out of the question for the staid lawns of Wimbledon, where anything but predominantly white is no-go.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So just what will Agassi, or rather his sponsors, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, come up with for the All England Championships, which start on Monday week? The man himself is not saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,&quot; Agassi said when asked in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world No 5 is revelling in the tease surrounding his choice of garb. He and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> know a good marketing ploy when they see one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi is also reported to be exclusively contracted to reveal all to a London tabloid newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the secrecy rumours abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word, according to one media hound, is that the Las Vegas showman will turn out for his first match in classical white from his headband down to his cycling shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that, he said, Agassi was likely to introduce a lightly coloured outfit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports this week said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, after discussing designs with Agassi, had been putting alternatives to the All England Committee and referee Alan Mills for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of the commotion is rule 8 of Wimbledon's &quot;Conditions of Entry and Participation&quot; which states that except for the warm-up period, all competitors must be dressed &quot;predominantly in white&quot; during matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To contravene the rule leaves a player liable for default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McEnroe is among its more famous victims, when he was required to change his dark blue shorts on centre court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times newspaper said no one could quite remember when the rule was cast in iron, but Wimbledon is the only one of the four Grand Slam tournaments to have such a strict dress code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Agassi's hot pink outfit caused Philippe Chatrier, head of both the French Tennis Federation and International Tennis Federation, to suggest the introduction of a &quot;predominantly white&quot; rule for the French Open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It led to a war of words with Agassi during the 1990 titles, but the issue did not arise this month when Agassi turned out in Paris in his toned-down, yet still colourful, combination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;predominantly white&quot; tradition is not greeted with enthusiasm by the multi-million dollar leisurewear industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Italian clothing outfit Diadora, which had guaranteed Jennifer Capriati $4.65 million for a five-year contract, had its range for the American whiz-kid turned down just before her Wimbledon debut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager, at the age of 14, was the youngest player to appear at Wimbledon and was the media sensation of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to be able to make stuff you can sell,&quot; said Ian Hamilton of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the problems is that 'predominantly white' does not sell and we can't keep producing clothes we cannot sell in shops.&quot; Alfred Schwarz, head of sports promotions for Adidas, which has Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf as clients, told The Times : &quot;The ruling makes us nervous because we have to guess when we produce our ranges what will be acceptable to Wimbledon, but it is very difficult to get all the manufacturers together to lobby for a more precise definition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From an image point of view, Wimbledon is the most watched event of any through the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has a certain meaning, but the design rule is a problem, and we feel that is our domain, not Wimbledon's.&quot; For Wimbledon, however, a priority is to protect the championships' tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, admitted the rule was ill-defined but said officials did not think it right to stipulate any percentage of white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very small amount of psychedelic colouring can be off-putting, while a pastel-coloured shirt could be perfectly acceptable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel and I think the players feel too that this is one of our better traditions.&quot; Agassi, whose talent is undoubted, will be making his first appearance at Wimbledon since 1987, when he was beaten in the first round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ability to hone his hard court game to the vagaries of grass is not the only thing everyone is waiting to see.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went to a lot of trouble and dollars to make a commercial in Africa for American audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea was to have a group of Masai warriors running through the bush wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trainers and endorsing the firm's product in between spearing passing antelopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grumpy looking warrior fronts the screen, mutters something in his native dialect and a translation appears on the screen &quot;&quot;Just do it&quot;, which is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America's slogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately that is not quite what the warrior actually said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freely translated, the grumpy-looking warrior said: &quot;&quot;These are horrid shoes and they aren't big enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As luck would have it, one of the few people outside Africa who spoke the warrior's language just happened to see the commercial at its first _ and only _ showing. End of commercial. Exit sullen natives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo knows doubt.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo knows fear.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His future?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo can't know.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, Bo Jackson seemed an unlimited and indestructible athlete. Fast as the Gulf wind, strong as a bull, and overendowed by the athletic gods. Star of the NFL, MLB and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Able to slug baseballs farther than anybody, and run with footballs as few have, and mesmerize a public that couldn't get enough of watching him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the super sneaker salesman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the Royals slugger.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the Raiders racer.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, and shockingly, Bo Jackson's mortality surfaced.  Turns out, he's human. Like you, like me, the 225-pound multisport Adonis is breakable. Wearing his black No. 34 football jersey, Jackson mangled a hip while straining for a first down in a Los Angeles Raiders playoff game Jan. 13. It may wind up being the kryptonite for this Superman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kansas City Royals teammate George Brett, a witness as Bo bounded away from baseball spring training on crutches, detected a &quot;Man, I'm scared&quot; look in Jackson eyes that have forever been cool, clever and cocksure. &quot;Bo's never thought there was anything he couldn't do,&quot; Brett said, &quot;but now he's worried he may never play again.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo is 28.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the L.A. Coliseum the afternoon Jackson went down against the Cincinnati Bengals. Carted away, he gave a thumbs-up, promising to &quot;definitely be in Buffalo&quot; for the following week's AFC Championship Game. I believed him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo didn't make it. He may never. On Monday, Jackson vowed to play baseball in the 1991 season. This time, I don't believe him. You wonder, does Bo believe Bo? Royals management thinks so little of his recuperative chances that Jackson's $ 2,375,000 contract was voided Monday, and Kansas City general manager Herk Robinson made him available to major-league rivals for the $ 1 waiver price.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A buck for Bo.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a tragedy to rival Lou Gehrig's disease, or golfer Tony Lema's death in a plane crash, or George Gipp being struck down at Notre Dame. No matter what happens, Bo Jackson should be rich, famous, marketable and able to do almost anything but play football and baseball. He'll still have a good wife, and wonderful kids.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you're Superman, you expect to always leap tall buildings. I predict Jackson will work inhumanly hard, sweating through rehab, trying to prove the Royals wrong, along with anybody else who suggests he's finished. Bo is a different breed, and he has spent a young lifetime getting kicks out of doing the unforecastable thing.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics said Jackson would never make it in professional baseball because he struck out in more than half his at-bats at Auburn University. We now know different. Bo kept on whiffing, but my how he has whacked the ball in the American League.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampa Bay made Bo its No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and voices kept saying that Jackson &quot;had to play.&quot; Again, he proved us wrong, and took delight in doing it. Bo chose baseball, but once the Bucs were out of his life, the football thoughts returned.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like me said Jackson would never be able to play both major-league baseball and in the National Football League. It has been a stretch, and not totally satisfactory for either the Royals or Raiders, but Bo has come remarkably close to pulling it off.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, when Jackson crumbled in Los Angeles, it seemed time for the young multimillionaire to loosen his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and make a choice. Do one sport, but not both. Enough of the carnival act, of being part-Royal and part-Raider. Bo's sensible decision had to be baseball, where his career might last another 10 years, if he could give up his combative &quot;hobby&quot; of football.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the choice may be gone.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have tears in my eyes, but instead there's an emptiness in my stomach. There is a wide-bodied loss. Bo Jackson has unique appeal. He puts paying fannies into ballpark seats. Ask </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> how he sells. Sports needs characters, and superhuman talents. Bo has been a little of both. I always wondered how good a baseball player might he be if he would give up football? Or how marvelous a Raider would he become if football was his only game?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may never know.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo may never know.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I am about to turn Jack Benny's eternal age.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To perhaps half the readers of the column, this disclosure will be significant only in its grand insignificance, a laughable announcement.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have known the other side of 39 and then some for a while now and live with restraint and dignity, on fixed incomes usually, while sneering at Aging Boomers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead. You have plenty of company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advertising mavens think people like me are such saps that all , they have to do is make up some snappy ad and we'll just dash out and slap down our Visa card for lineless bifocals, Lycra tights and Gap turtlenecks anything to prop up our delusion that we are exempt from the toll of years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be sure, though, that this advertising rubbish has had no impact on me.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, you will see, is another form of delusion.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picture it: I was window-shopping in the local sports shop. The first thing I did was snap up one of those costumes fit for wearing while suffering muscle pulls and trying to fool the years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I spied the poster. Because there is such a thing in the world as principle, I passed up the impulse to buy it although it turned out the poster wasn't for sale.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just memorized the way it looked.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poster, actually an ad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> featured a nearly life-sized black and white '50s-era photo of a kid in pigtails who could have been Beaver's first girlfriend.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superimposed over the photo was a string of words about how this was really a picture of what a 40-year-old woman looks like.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message this medium conveyed was that cliche, dusted off and dressed up to be hip, about how you're only as old as you feel.  And how you can run that marathon and overhaul your lumpy self, even if you are 40.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of advice that desperate Aging Boomers really need to hear anything to spend money and to dress like Jimmy Connors, who did so remarkably well, for a 39-year-old, at the U.S.  Open last week.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I get it right, the advertising mavens are telling me I should run, swim, bike, jump, hop, swing, kick, pitch, punt, row, lift, squeeze, push, pull, stretch, lean, throw, flex, walk, skate and skip into new shape and strength.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been trying to do that. People who know my former, lumpy self would hardly recognize me now.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But guess what else happened?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran into the one hitch that the people at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never tell you about.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so busy exercising, there wasn't time for anything else. Not watching a movie or writing a book or dreaming a dream or listening to a friend, not sweeping the floor, doing the laundry, or contemplating the future and my place in it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible discovery, worse than confronting crow's feet or sagging skin.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older you get, the less time you have to do things.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're 20, life is a limitless vista, a free lunch, a Monopoly game where the bad plays don't count.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're 40, you can make a list of the bad plays already and you wish somebody would fold up the game board and pull out, maybe, Trivial Pursuit. You've done pretty well at that, metaphorically speaking.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start making lists of the trips you want to take, the people you want to meet, the jobs you'd rather have. You start considering a new set of choices, and this time, you vow to get them right.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start picturing yourself with the lines and the creases that are coming regardless. And you don't hesitate to get annoyed at people whom you suspect are wasting your time including those advertising mavens who concoct clever ads to sell $ 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes to Aging Boomers and are probably already working on ads to sell us workout shoes for our retirement, if we have any money left then.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the gift that comes when you turn Jack Benny's eternal age: an awareness of time, how it is a resource no longer for wasting, how it moves faster than you, until there is no more.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is why everybody, even couch potatoes, wears running shoes: to fool ourselves into thinking we can keep up.<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JOSEPH PEREIRA<BR>The Wall Street Journal<BR> FIRST came </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air shoe. Then came Reebok's Pump. And now there's<BR>Puma's Disc System sneaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Forget about laces and a tongue. The Disc System instead features a<BR>&quot;closure unit&quot; that is turned like the dial on a ski boot, an<BR>&quot;anatomically premolded compression unit&quot; that replaces the tongue and<BR>&quot;lateral stabilizing elements&quot; that tighten the sides for a better fit.<BR>All for just $125 (U.S.) a pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may sound more like astronaut gear than a sneaker, but that's the<BR>point. In the athletic footwear world, the race is not so much to the<BR>swift nowadays as to the one with the latest gimmick.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This industry has turned into the battle of the bells and whistles. .<BR>. . For a time, there even was a real wild shoe you could hook up to your<BR>computer to tell how far you've run,&quot; says Steven Frankel, an analyst at<BR>Adams Harkness &amp; Hill Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, with the $5.5-billion U.S. sneaker market maturing and showing<BR>little growth, dozens of markers are touting their own high-technology<BR>shoes, from Adidas AG's Tortion Bar to Interco Inc.'s Converse Y-Bar to<BR>Hyde Inc.'s Saucony Ground Reaction Inertia Device to Reebok International<BR>Ltd.'s Avia Compression Chamber system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the Disc System show will revive the sluggish sales of Puma<BR>USA, the U.S. unit of Sweden's Aritmos, remains to be seen. Most hot shoes<BR>have proved to be fads, as fickle buyers - especially teen-agers, the<BR>biggest part of the market - switch brands frequently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's Pump, which quickly became a big hit when it was introduced<BR>two years ago, already shows signs of being winded. So Reebok will soon<BR>introduce the Double Pump, a sneaker that, yes, features not one, but two<BR>air bladders and two inflation gadgets to pump more air into more parts of<BR>the shoe. It will retail for $159 a pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok says the new shoe will expand the Pump line, and not replace the<BR>single Pump, which costs less. &quot;The Pump provides a custom fit, but the<BR>Double Pump can tailor almost all of the shoe to the foot,&quot; says John<BR>Duerden, president and chief executive officer of Reebok brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brief history of the Pump shows how tough the athletic shoe<BR>business has become - even for hits. Hoping to improve Reebok's image as a<BR>performance shoe, the company targeted the 18-to-35-year-old male. But<BR>most buyers were younger, as the shoe became a status symbol for teen-<BR>agers and their preteen siblings. &quot;I have four-year-olds coming into the<BR>store asking for the Pump,&quot; notes Liz Butler, assistant manager for Lady's<BR>Athlete's Foot in Burlington, Mass. &quot;And a friend of mine has an infant<BR>who wears Pumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the Pump will account for about 7 per cent of Reebok's shoe<BR>sales. Reebok says it remains a strong brand, but orders have dropped, in<BR>part because kids are looking for something new. &quot;It's a very fickle, very<BR>fashion-oriented crowd,&quot; explains Josie Esquivel, a Shearson Lehman<BR>Brothers Inc. analyst. &quot;With them, once the fizz is gone, that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also hampering the Pump's image were a number of unhappy customers who<BR>returned the shoes to stores either because of manufacturing defects or<BR>complaints that it took too long to pump up the shoe. &quot;Several of my<BR>customers brought the Pump back because the soles fell off or because of a<BR>flat-tire feeling in the arch area,&quot; reports Gregory Hatch, an assistant<BR>manager of Snyder's Shoe Store in Washington, D.C. &quot;Consequently, the Pump<BR>started losing its status symbol in the eyes of my customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok says that any problems have been fixed, and that excitement over<BR>the Double Pump will breathe new life into the brand. Others aren't so<BR>sure. &quot;The Double Pump won't be overnight salvation,&quot; predicts John Horan,<BR>editor and publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence Management News Inc.,<BR>an industry newsletter. &quot;It's going to be a very long and slow process<BR>educating the consumer that this is more than just a gimmick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some customers are wary of all the high-tech hype. &quot;This is absolutely<BR>crazy,&quot; says John Sagebrush, a federal court clerk, while hunting for a<BR>pair of sneakers at a store in downtown Boston. Scanning a wall mounted<BR>with more than 80 different styles and listening to a salesman's<BR>description of their features, he sighs, &quot;How can a man decide? They all<BR>look the same and all sound good enough to wear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adidas, in fact, is trying to take advantage of the confusion. To raise<BR>its shoes above the clutter, Adidas says in its current catalogue, &quot;People<BR>are tired of gimmicks, hype and inflated pricing. They want honest<BR>performance, quality and value. . . . It's time to get back to what is<BR>essential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puma insists that its Disc System isn't a gimmick, but a major step<BR>forward in improving fit and performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how the shoe works: after slipping it on, you tighten it by<BR>turning the disc where the tongue is located on conventional sneakers. The<BR>disc is connected to a series of nylon cords that extend to various parts<BR>of the shoe - unlike shoelaces, which tighten only the top of a<BR>conventional shoe. This results in a better fit, the company says. The<BR>system is released by turning the disc in the opposite direction or<BR>pressing a release button. Puma will begin selling running, tennis,<BR>&quot;cross-training&quot; and track spike versions of the shoes next spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how good the shoe is, it won't be easy for Puma to succeed<BR>against the marketing clout of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. and Reebok, which dominate the<BR>market and spend more than $75-million a year each on advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's so much product out there,&quot; says Jennifer Black Groves, an<BR>analyst for Black Inc. in Portland, Ore. &quot;Sometimes, it comes down to who<BR>can shout the loudest and the longest.&quot;<BR>  Reprinted with permission of The Wall Street Journal 1991 Dow Jones &amp;<BR>Co.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no trick to finding the Georgia Dome these days. It finds&nbsp;you. Nine months ago the $ 210 million project was merely a few concrete&nbsp;footings. Now much of the Dome's outside structure rises dramatically out&nbsp;of what last year was a vacant lot. On May 1, they start on the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By February, 1992, the exterior will be watertight. Hey, 25 years&nbsp;later, they can't even say that about Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. . .&nbsp;. Georgia Dome officials even found two suites recently they didn't know&nbsp;existed. Architects had planned for four owner suites - two upper level&nbsp;and two lower level - but only two are needed. Dome marketing director&nbsp;Dennis Berkholtz leased the newly discovered ones for $ 80,000 each. . . .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go figure: The Georgia Dome still has a dirt floor and cannot be&nbsp;used. Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium puts tons of dirt over it's sodded&nbsp;grass to hold a motocross Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPER BUDGET: How big has &quot;The Super Show&quot; become? Exhibit A: The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people have a $ 6 million budget just for this week's events at the&nbsp;Georgia World Congress Center. Things are so secretive regarding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;presentation Thursday that a security guard has been stationed next to&nbsp;the escalator leading to the ballroom level, under an elaborate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;archway. Workers in the area assembling booths must wear ID bracelets. .&nbsp;. . Exhibit B: No other trade show in the nation requires what this one&nbsp;does. All current exhibitors must pay for next year's space before they&nbsp;leave on Feb. 24, allowing show organizers to draw interest on the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KISSING BANDIT: To the tune of &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores,&nbsp;mascot Harry the Hawk came out during a timeout dressed as a buxom blonde&nbsp;and swaggered up to NBA official Dick Bavetta at last Saturday night's&nbsp;Hawks-Sonics game. Locking up with Harry in a sudden embrace, Bavetta&nbsp;laid one emphatically on the mascot's kisser. When razzed by players on&nbsp;the Hawks bench, Bavetta glanced over to them and said, &quot;Hey, it's lonely&nbsp;on the road.&quot; . . . Hawks trainer Joe O'Toole has lost 40 pounds over a&nbsp;period of less than three months and is down to about 180 - no small feat&nbsp;considering the caloric nightmare of food on the road. It didn't come&nbsp;without a struggle. O'Toole's beloved afternoon ice-cream snacks are&nbsp;pretty much history, and he walks at least 40 minutes a day. On a recent&nbsp;trip to San Francisco O'Toole walked from Fisherman's Wharf across the&nbsp;Golden Gate Bridge and back, a distance of about nine miles, in 3 1/2&nbsp;hours. . . . Somebody forgot to tell Kevin Loughery he isn't a head coach&nbsp;anymore. It's his voice, not Bob Weiss's, that carries from the Hawks&nbsp;bench. . . . Kelly Freeman, Miss Augusta, sang the national anthem&nbsp;Saturday night. So why were there are few catcalls when she was&nbsp;introduced to The Omni crowd? Mistakenly, she was referred to as Miss Augu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE TRENCHES: Atlanta Falcons offensive guard John Scully, who&nbsp;studies battles and war strategy in his spare time, has difficulty&nbsp;getting a feel for the Persian Gulf conflict. &quot;It's kind of hard to&nbsp;develop a mental picture,&quot; said Scully, who has a model of the Battle of&nbsp;Murfreesboro set up in his house. &quot;You don't even know the disposition of&nbsp;troops on the border. It's truly desert warfare. The only thing you could&nbsp;compare it with is the North African campaign during World War II, where&nbsp;logistics and supplies were really how campaigns were won or lost. It's&nbsp;difficult to defend in the desert because it's a featureless terrain.&nbsp;There's no place to hide. The attacker usually is rewarded.&quot; . . . Todd&nbsp;Marinovich, the banished Southern Cal quarterback, still has a lifestyle&nbsp;unbalanced from most folks. He's never tried a Big Mac, and they've never&nbsp;tried cocaine. . . . A nickname that should have stuck by now for a&nbsp;player who moves swiftly, sometimes under enemy defenses, and&nbsp;occasionally inflicts great damage from the perimeter: Scud Webb. . . .&nbsp;Hard to believe: Dunwoody tour golfer Tim Simpson, during a recent TV&nbsp;interview, claiming not to be bothered if people fail to recognize his&nbsp;talent. Sure, and at the Masters, Simpson would shrug off a ball shanked t</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sporting goods industry resembles Dominique Wilkins's missed&nbsp;slam-dunk in this year's NBA All-Star game: There's still plenty of&nbsp;spring in its legs, but maybe not what there used to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the message, in effect, that John D. Riddle, president of&nbsp;the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, deliverd to analysts&nbsp;Wednesday. They were gathered at the Georgia World Congress Center on the&nbsp;eve of the industry's annual Super Show mega-convention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Riddle said the $ 30 billion industry grew 6 percent last year -&nbsp;good, compared with the 2 percent overall growth of U.S. manufacturing,&nbsp;but sharply down from the double-digit growth in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manufacturers are prepared for a good, but by no means great,&nbsp;year,&quot; said Mr. Riddle, who attributed the slowdown to the recession and&nbsp;tight credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales growth this year will be driven by sports apparel and&nbsp;equipment for tennis, bowling and billiards, Mr. Riddle said, estimating&nbsp;8 percent increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous years, athletic shoes put the bounce in the industry's&nbsp;step. But shoe sales may rise only 6 percent this year, he predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparel sales, worth $ 13.6 billion, will eclipse total sales for all&nbsp;sporting equipment at $ 10.9 billion, he predicted.; Pumping it up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletic shoe manufacturers, meanwhile, have stepped up rivalries to&nbsp;increase their sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 2 Reebok three weeks ago launched its most agressive advertising&nbsp;effort yet, attacking No. 1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a $ 20 million campaign using the&nbsp;slogan &quot;Pump up, and air out.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cried foul, claiming Reebok was&nbsp;abusing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorsers by mentioning them in Reebok's ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman told analysts Wednesday the company&nbsp;plans to step up the attack, pumping an additional $ 15 million into its&nbsp;ad budget this year, for a total of $ 70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Reebok said it plans to buy up 21.3 percent of its&nbsp;outstanding common stock for $ 396 million. As part of the deal, Pentland&nbsp;Group PLC will reduce its stake in Reebok to 13 percent from 31.6&nbsp;percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating a natural marketing tie-in with basketball star and fellow&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pitchman Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, outfielder Bo Jackson&nbsp;signed with the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not the fame, it's not the money, it's the chance to go out&nbsp;and get the world championship,&quot; said Jackson, who signed a one-year&nbsp;contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Toronto Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick said he&nbsp;thinks an association with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> influenced Jackson's decision as much as&nbsp;the White Sox's status as contenders in the American League West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deal was in Chicago. With him and Jordan owned by&nbsp;the same company, there is so much imagination that can come out of&nbsp;something like that,&quot; Gillick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillick's Blue Jays and the Atlanta Braves were the other two clubs&nbsp;considered seriously by Jackson, a free agent after his release by the&nbsp;Kansas City Royals because of a hip injury sustained in last season's NFL&nbsp;playoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We weren't able to get into it at all,&quot; said Braves general manager&nbsp;John Schuerholz. &quot;Richard Woods Jackson's agent called me Tuesday&nbsp;night to tell me things were moving pretty rapidly. He didn't tell me a&nbsp;signing was imminent. But there was nothing we could do about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's salary will depend on how much he is able to play. The&nbsp;White Sox have options for 1992 and 1993. The first option will be&nbsp;automatic if Jackson is activated for at least 40 games this season. The&nbsp;White Sox must pick up the second option if Jackson plays at least 125&nbsp;games in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson will earn $ 10,000 for each game played this season or a&nbsp;total of $ 700,000, whichever is greater. If he fulfills all performance&nbsp;bonuses over the next three seasons, he will make $ 8.1 million. Bonuses&nbsp;earned will automatically be included in the next season's base salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract does not prohibit Jackson from fulfilling the final&nbsp;year of his $ 7.4 million contract with the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders if&nbsp;his health permits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> print ads last year included a campaign that featured&nbsp;basketball star Michael Jordan and filmmaker Spike Lee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining Top 10, in order, were: Camel cigarettes, Revlon,&nbsp;Absolut vodka, Infiniti cars, Marlboro cigarettes, Guess apparel, Ford&nbsp;automobiles and trucks and Maybelline cosmetics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAT DANGER: Lots of children get hurt batting in baseball each year,&nbsp;and a Roanoke, Va., woman is doing something about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorine S. Caveness 14 years ago founded Home Safe Face Guards to&nbsp;make plastic shields to protect the batter's face from a pitched ball.&nbsp;She began developing the guard in 1968 for her son. The guard attaches to&nbsp;the sides of a standard batting helmet, covering the chin to the tip of&nbsp;the nose. The eyes are exposed, but a guard keeps the ball from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 5,500 baseball-&nbsp;related eye injuries were treated in hospital emergency rooms in 1989.&nbsp;Another study found 42,000 facial injuries each year in amateur baseball,&nbsp;with 18,000 for players age 5 to 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, Little League and Dixie Youth Baseball require helmets&nbsp;but not masks. However, Little League officials in Marietta, Ga., do&nbsp;require face masks. One coach, Richard Hilton, described the face mask as&nbsp;&quot;the best piece of safety equipment in Little League&quot; since the helmet.&nbsp;The guards cost $ 13 each. A wire face guard made by Schutt Manufacturing&nbsp;of Litchfield, Ill., is available at sports stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAT DANGER: One in five sick cats has one of two deadly diseases,&nbsp;feline leukemia or a more recently identified virus similar to AIDS in&nbsp;humans, according to a new study. IDEXX Corp. of Portland, Ore., surveyed&nbsp;1,500 veterinary clinics in the United States and covered 27,000 sick&nbsp;cats. The study showed that 7.4 percent of the cats suffered from feline&nbsp;immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, and 13.3 percent suffered from feline&nbsp;leukemia, a similar disease that also suppresses the ability of cats to&nbsp;fight off disease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad Carithers scored 16 goals to lead the Gladiators to first place&nbsp;in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under-19 indoor tournament last week at The Soccer Academy in&nbsp;Lilburn. The Gladiators defeated Phoenix 9-0 in the championship game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was our best tournament in the seven years of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said&nbsp;Steve Keiss, tournament director. &quot;We had no ejections, all games were&nbsp;played in the proper spirit, and fans, players and officials all had a&nbsp;tremendous time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Most Valuable Player was Troy Wood of the Steamers '75, whose&nbsp;team was eliminated 4-2 in the semifinals by the Gladiators. Steve Brandt&nbsp;of Chelsea Villa, which lost 3-0 in the semifinals to Phoenix, was named&nbsp;Best Defender. John Brown of Chelsea Villa was voted Most Sportsmanlike.&nbsp;Michael Rachael of Phoenix and Mark Albertus of the Gladiators were voted&nbsp;Best Goalkeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-team tournament was divided into three divisions. Each&nbsp;division played a round-robin format to decide who reached the playoff&nbsp;round. The top two teams in each division and the next two teams with the&nbsp;best record qualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quarterfinals: Phoenix beat the Grasshoppers 4-3; Chelsea&nbsp;Villa beat the Homeless Millionaires 6-3; the Gladiators topped the&nbsp;Yellow Bellies 10-2; and the Steamers downed the Smart Wunz 6-2. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two local women's teams lost in the Region III finals in Charleston,&nbsp;S.C., last week. In the over-30 division, Poco Loco of Texas defeated the&nbsp;Atlanta Breeze 6-5 on penalty kicks. In the open division, North Texas&nbsp;defeated Soccer Warehouse 5-1. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The under-12 Brookwood Steamers lost to the Gadsden, Ala., Hawks in&nbsp;a tournament played at Canterbury Park in Kennesaw. The game was tied 1-1&nbsp;and the Steamers lost on the fifth penalty kick. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlanta Express, the local team competing in the Sunbelt&nbsp;Independent Soccer League, is in third place in the Southeast Division&nbsp;after a 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Quicksilver. David Smith, an Atlanta&nbsp;Attack player, got the winning goal - his second of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Express goals came from Richard Taylor and Selby Neese. The&nbsp;Quicksilver got goals from Scott Smith, Tracy Crouch and Gilberto&nbsp;Ramirez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Express (1-2) trails undefeated Memphis and Arkansas (3-0) in&nbsp;outdoors play. The Express has added Greg Sheen of the Attack and Mark&nbsp;Gailey, the starting goalkeeper for the University of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two teams meet three more times this season.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHEN England have friends like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who have a contract to supply the squad with boots, they might well begin to wonder who their enemies are. That company's full-page advert in yesterday's national newspapers - 'Scotland the Brave (they'd better be)' - could hardly be less appropriate to a World Cup semi-final that cries out for skill and enterprise instead of the muscle and mayhem that has largely dominated the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It's going to be rough. It's going to be tough. It's going to be fierce (and that's just in the tunnel).' Whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gung-ho copy is a tasteless incitement to violence or even a half-baked reference to the Dubroca affair, the implication that rugby football is just a brutal collision is surely not the image the competition is trying to project to millions of television viewers around the globe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> England, one assumes, will want to demonstrate that their game plan involves something more than a pack of ageing forwards riding roughshod (albeit in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boots) over their hosts in an updated version of Culloden. Not that the Scots, who are no innocents in an alley fight, will allow themselves to be intimidated and mentally disconcerted as France were in Paris a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To their credit, both Geoff Cooke and Ian McGeechan have sought to play down the unhealthy nationalist hype that has inevitably built up around this latest Anglo-Scottish clash. In recent seasons the Calcutta Cup has produced a series of appalling dog fights with just four tries in the last four matches. The danger is that today's game will follow the same depressing stop-start-stop pattern despite the knockout context that should in theory put a premium on scoring tries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time England began to live up to the 'run with the ball' campaign they launched with a glitzy fanfare in Kensington last month. Led by shop steward and corporate lawyer Brian Moore, the players hope to emerge with at least pounds 5,000 each - cash that can only really be justified by providing the kind of spectacle that actually involves . . . yes, running with the ball. If this well-heeled lot want to live by the readies they have a duty to entertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, England should not find it so difficult to remind the world that rugby is after all a handling game and not just an interminable kick-and-chase. This week one bomb-weary wag remarked that the Webb Ellis Trophy should be renamed the Garryowen Cup (with a special lifetime achievement award for Rob Andrew), yet excellent ball handlers such as Halliday, Guscott, Ackford, Teague and Carling all have ability to rebut such criticism at Murrayfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been clear that England's problem about moving the ball wide springs from a lack of nerve, notwithstanding the huge amount of talent in the back division. Under the influence of the coaches an expansive game has come to be perceived as a losing ticket, even though England were beaten in the 1990 Grand Slam decider mainly because they were unable or unwilling to run the ball. On the single occasion they moved it wide swiftly Guscott scored a magnificent try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, this semi-final is not merely a question of releasing the backs, important as that is. England will surely attempt to exploit the 6ft 7in Doddie Weir's lack of international experience in the middle of the line-out where Wade Dooley, 13 years his senior, knows all the relevant ploys. No doubt Cooke was stepping up the propaganda war when he said: 'I felt I might have preferred Damian Cronin (to Weir) because of his experience.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One suspects, though, that the outcome will turn on the confrontation between the two oldest international back rows in the business. If Teague, Skinner and Winterbottom can plunder the same share of loose ball they claimed from the French then it is difficult to see England losing. Kickable penalties, if not tries, are bound to follow as Scotland battle to contain the pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet that neat theory fails to take account of the marauding power of Jeffrey, White and Calder who together are close to setting a world record for international appearances. This charismatic trio - who hope to make their swansong in the final - have a genius for attacking (and defending) around the fringes that has often smothered England's best efforts. As long as they all remain on the field no one can predict a Scotland defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is tempting to forecast triumph for an England side whose confidence is sky high after coming through their special version of Waterloo. But Scotland are defending a three-year unbeaten run at Murrayfield, stretching to 13 victories. More to the point, perhaps, the Scots have a cool belief in their own ability to beat anyone, including New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Calder remarked the other day, the outcome could well depend on a single fortuitous bounce of the ball, as it arguably did when Stanger scored his opportunist try for the Scots last year. No two matches between England and Scotland, however, are quite the same. All one can reasonably expect, whatever </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say, is that nothing nasty happens in the tunnel before or after.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LIBERATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE strain is beginning to show on Adidas as it struggles to keep its lead over US-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok in the European sports shoe market. Directors of Adidas, the German firm which sold a majority stake to French entrepreneur Bernard Tapie last year, confirmed at Munich's Sports Clothing Trade Fair that they are stripping off everying apart from the precious trade name to keep ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Far Eastern rights to Coq Sportif - the football boots to tennis shoes and clothing label, and most of the Arena leisure wear brands - were sold last year. In spring the Arena beachwear range will be up for grabs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it seems that the 'for sale' sign has been hoisted over Pony, the US-based footwear brand, and Erima, the soccer strip company. And there may be more pruning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We don't need so many brand names,' admits managing director Rene Jaggi, while Hans Friederichs, chairman of the supervisory board, adds: 'We need to concentrate on a single brand.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bernard Tapie has thus had to swallow his ambitions of turning Adidas into a high fashion brand name and follow the more realistic strategy of the German heads of the group of returning to the sports field and concentrating on its strongest points - sports shoes and clothing, as well as delivery of products on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The income from the sale of the other brands will provide a welcome injection of capital, for although Adidas went into the black in 1990, its finances remain precarious, with a profit of only DM30 million (Pounds 10 million) on a turnover of DM3,355 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In three years' time, we'll be the biggest in Europe,' Bertrand Gaillochet, director of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-France, predicts confidently. The firm will intensify its successful ploy of associating its name with the most popular sportsmen and women from top to toe and telling the whole world about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adidas recognises its weakness in the face of its American competitors. In France and Germany (40 per cent of its turnover) the firm does not expect further growth. 'We have to make enormous efforts just to stay at the same level.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There remains the American market, of which Adidas has only 3-4 per cent. 'If there's going to be any growth, that's where it will come from,' concludes the Adidas chairman. This ambition leaves </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cold. 'I shall not comment on their strategy,' replies Richard Donahue, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, 'simply because I can't understand it.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOOTING A BULLET with a bullet is, in effect, what the Army's Patriot missiledoes when it kills an incoming Scud.  So far, the Patriot appears to be knocking down each Scud that has come under fire. This stems from a mixture of high technology and luck.  Finding a defense against ballistic missiles - missiles whose flight path forms a high, inverted ''U'' at thousands of miles a hour - has become for military researchers the hunt for the Holy Grail.  For more than 40 years, the United States has invested tens of billions of dollars in trying to develop an anti-missile missile. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Zeus program of the '50s gave way to the Spartan and Sprint programs of the '60s.  The search slowed slightly after 1972, when the United States and the Soviets signed an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting each to only one anti-missile launching area.  Still, anti-missile research continued through the '70s. It exploded in the '80s under President Ronald Reagan, who launched the Strategic Defense Initiative - instantly dubbed ''Star Wars.'' Although the Patriot incorporates some of the Star Wars technology, the program itself dates back almost 30 years and is rooted in the Sam-D anti-aircraft missile of the early '60s.  At that time, the Army wanted: A replacement for its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hercules (a high-altitude anti-aircraft missile) and its Hawk, at least as its medium-altitude role.  A more self-contained missile unit, or battery, that would allow soldiers to move it more quickly around the battlefield.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most accurate missile in the world - a specification that caused big problems.  This cutting-edge-of-technology approach nearly killed the Patriot in Congress because it added billions of dollars in cost and forced a 15-year development program.  But in the end, the extra money and time let the Patriot blast Scuds from the sky.  Each Patriot battery has a radar set, a command center, an electric power plant and eight boxy ''launching stations,'' which look like large freight containers, each with four missiles. All the equipment rides on vehicles or trailers.  The core of the system is called ''phased-array'' radar - the latest radar, in which the antenna stands still while the electronic signals move in high-speed bursts.  The radar first detects the incoming Scuds, then ''tracks'' them - plots their course - and finally guides the Patriots to the Scuds. The radar performs the tasks of nine types of radar of the old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hercules and Hawk missile batteries.  The solid-fuel Patriot is 17.5 feet long and 16 inches in diameter. In theory, even a near-miss with its 200-pound fragmentation warhead will kill a Scud. But for all practical purposes, the speeds involved demand a direct hit.  That makes timing critical, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham of High Frontier, a private group that pushes Star Wars.  ''You've got only a couple of minutes,'' Graham said, to detect and track the Scuds and fire the Patriots. Even with their range of more than 40 miles, the Patriots destroy the Scuds only 2 to 4 seconds before the Scuds would otherwise hit.  Now, luck is critical.  The Patriot has a limited ''footprint'' - the area it can defend.  And just as the Patriot's area is limited, so is its ability to cope with mass waves of missiles.  Although the radar is said to be able to track 100 targets at a time, Graham warned that the number that can be actually shot at is limited.  ''Each battery has eight launchers with four missiles each, so that's 16 targets,'' Graham said, assuming two Patriots for each Scud.  Before the war, the Army had four Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia. Graham said he had not heard of any more being sent. But he says that given the experience of recent days, more might be.  Few people say the Patriot fulfills the promise of Star Wars. An Iraqi Scud is a far easier target than a Soviet intercontinental missile with maneuverable warheads.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Bo Jackson's sporting career is over, that would make him the last of the great baseball stars, and even he didn't exactly qualify. He was a hybrid, a baseball-football freak whose like we hadn't seen since Jim Thorpe. And it took a shoe commercial to make him really famous anyway.  Where are the great baseball stars? I mean real stars, Ruthian stars, where-have-you-gone-Joe-DiMaggio stars? Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Hammerin' Hank stars?  As far as I can tell, there aren't any, even though baseball, as a game, is bigger, grander, more popular than ever, or haven't you tried pricing baseball cards lately? And even though we live in an era where anyone - picture your name here - can be a celebrity.  It isn't as if the games we play aren't yielding heroes. Michael Jordan is the only man in America whose popularity rivals Stormin' Norman (take note: he drinks Diet Pepsi) Schwarzkopf. He is On-The-Air Jordan. Talk about hang time, Jordan has true staying power, from your shoes to your breakfast table to your soft drink to who knows where it will end. It doesn't stop with Jordan, either. Old people get Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Young people get Boris Becker and John McEnroe. Magic Johnson, Mr. Robinson. And Joe Montana, he's everywhere now. Even Mike Tyson. Greg Lemond - who rides a bicycle - gets Taco Bell. Basketball, football, boxing, cycling, golf, tennis.  Baseball, anyone?  Maybe it's the criteria we set for stardom these days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the modern era, stardom has come to mean endorsements, commercials, TV time. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made Bo; Bo didn't make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike. Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did as much for Bo as Miller Lite did for Marv Throneberry. It's all an advertising game.  Let's take the case of David Robinson, who is a fine basketball player but no better than Patrick Ewing or Hakeem Olajuwon. Somebody in advertising picked out Robinson, who is bright and articulate, but the ad boys didn't trade on that, either. They made Robinson into the stereotypical 7-foot mean guy whose path you had better cross only with caution, in comic juxtaposition with the numbing calmness of Mr. Rogers. It's a media creation, and Mr.  Robinson, although he performs in a small market, is now a media star.  Why didn't somebody pick Rickey Henderson instead?  There is one easy explanation, and that's shoes. Basketball players wear shoes that people buy by the millions, pumping up the volume. People don't kick back in cleats, if only for safety reasons. The shoe industry and the National Basketball Association have fed nicely on each other in classic economic symbiosis, and they've both grown apace. And there's the crossover effect. Minute Maid is coming out with a commercial starring Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins and Ewing, who are hot because basketball is hot because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials are hot.  But Boomer Esiason just got a Reebok commercial. Why not Don Mattingly? Why not Eric Davis? Why not Ryne Sandberg? Why not Dwight Gooden?  Nolan Ryan is getting work these days, but, gosh, is there a better story anywhere in sports? This guy is a biological phenomenon who, by any logic, ought to be a megastar - but who isn't, at least on Madison Avenue.  Even the experts are stumped. If the time is ripe for anti-heroes - McEnroe, Jim McMahon, Brian Bosworth, Charles Barkley - why not Jose Canseco, who has fame, personality and all the bad, bad boy you could ask for? Go figure.  There are actually more stars, in the old sense, in baseball than in any other sport. There are names that people who follow baseball know. But as it was explained to me, baseball, in advertising jargon, is an ''old reliable brand'' and therefore possesses limited sex appeal. And it's a regional brand.  Cal Ripken is big in Baltimore, Andre Dawson in Chicago and Michael Jordan everywhere.  But could there be more to it? Has baseball somehow become a faceless sport? Or is it that the real heroes, say Pete Rose, have shown themselves to be flawed?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEON LACES BLUR into streams of color as boys skate their way toward the goal.Hockey sticks fly around neon laces and a neon puck while the otherwise all-black skates scream along equally black asphalt pavement.  On this particular day, there are enough of these neon-and-black skates, plus baseball caps, full-cut shorts and T-shirts to make them all look like parts of an unofficial uniform on St. Louis' active roller-hockey scene.  Other kids at St. Peter's Catholic school parking lot in Kirkwood could care less about fashion, however.  Skating alongside boys wearing the new, loose-fitting nylon shorts by Umbro - topped sometimes with Umbro or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T-shirts - are boys wearing other, longer shorts or well-worn jeans. These youths, and many adults, who've begun lacing up the trademarked Roller Blades plus other brands of in-line skates - also referred to generically as ''roller blades'' - are doing so for the sheer fun of speeding along on the sets of parallel wheels, if not playing a game or getting an aerobic workout in them.  But the fact that blading is a popular and growing sport means that retailers of sporting goods are building up, and selling, their supplies of related accessories.  ''The Umbro name itself,'' says Omni Sports' buyer Larry Brandenberg, ''is like Polo to the kids. It's a real status thing. It's been popular because of the shorts and now, all of a sudden, because of the street hockey. I think the Blues had an impact on it,'' he says of the St. Louis ice-hockey team's success this season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And now, roller hockey is just as hot, if not hotter, than when the Blues were playing.'' Rick Remmy, manager of the Alpine Shop, reports a 200 percent increase in orders for Roller Blades and other in-line skates since the store began carrying them some six years ago. He added that adult skaters are going for clothing with the roominess that they find in new Patagonia ''baggy'' shorts or in a line of Quicksilver sporting shorts and tops.  ''Anything we get in, we can't keep in stock,'' says John Callahan, merchandise coordinator of footwear for Casey's Sport/Gart Bros. stores.  ''It's definitely our best-selling item, the blades and everything surrounded with it.'' And at Outdoors Inc., where the focus traditionally has been on other sports, blading has generated enough demand to warrant stocking a full inventory of skates this year, says store manager Rick Washburn. Before, blades were special-ordered. And Washburn says Columbia's full-cut ''gorge'' shorts, plus the Patagonia baggy shorts, are popular options for skaters.  On the St. Peter's school lot, clothing also needs to have ample room for movement.  Of his Umbros, says sixth-grader Mike Molick, ''Everybody likes to wear them because they're loose and because everybody wears them.'' But, he adds, ''We just wear any kind of thing you want to wear.'' ''Do you consider that you're making a fashion statement?'' asks an adult, stepping into the swarm of some 30 boys and their hockey gear.  ''No,'' several answer at once.  ''Then why all the Umbros and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Already, it's become clear from talking with a few of the players that they've had to work at home or in the neighborhood to make some money to pay for their skating gear.  ''If you have tight-fitting shorts,'' a young blader says simply, ''you won't be able to move fast enough.'' The outfits worn by blading adults may be even more trendy.  Take the stuff that Dr. Tom Switzer, a dentist from the Central West End, had on the other day as he skated briskly on the bicycle path near Lindell Boulevard in Forest Park.  Switzer wore neon green, full-cut </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shorts and a matching green </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T-shirt; a neon pink baseball cap; royal blue knee pads; red elbow pads; brown wrist protectors for ''my moneymakers'' he says of his wrists and hands - ''If I broke these, I'd be out of business''; a headset radio tucked into a hem-line pocket of the shorts; black gloves; blue ski poles, with baskets removed for city blading; and, of course, roller blades with neon pink laces.  Of his bright colors, Switzer said, ''That just happens to be the style now. But nine times out of 10, being a bachelor, I'll take what's next in the drawer until I get down to the bottom and then take it all to the laundry.'' Blading in the summer, he said, keeps his snow-skiing muscles fit. He started the skating three years ago, going vigorously around the park's six-mile bike path at least three times a week. ''When I started, I would almost never see another person'' on the in-line skates. ''This year there's been a quantum leap.'' The 46-year-old dentist emphasized the importance of careful skating and some protective clothing. He fell on the debris-strewn Forest Park path after a storm not too long ago and bruised a rib. Crowded conditions on the path, with cyclists, runners, bladers, p ower walkers, even strollers, sharing the space also can create hazardous conditions, he said.  Jim Gleason, 20, who was blading nearby in shorts, T-shirt and headband in various shades of pink, plus darker pink hues on belt bag and gloves, was trying out a freshly healed hand he had broken while skating elsewhere.  A sales associate at Target, Gleason occasionally comes to Forest Park from Des Peres, where he lives, to work out and execute some expert, free-style skating moves. More often, he blades in parking lots near his home.  ''Gloves,'' Gleason said, ''probably are the most important thing to wear,'' especially because falling forward often means landing on a wrist or hand, he said. ''I tried to wear knee pads,'' Gleason added, ''but they got in the way.'' Otherwise, he prefers an outfit of loose-fitting shorts, sometimes with another pair of stretchy spandex shorts underneath, and ''always a headband,'' Gleason said, to keep the sweat out of his eyes.  Two other Forest Park skaters that day were happily out of style and also short one pair of skates. Bryan Reckamp, 14, and Luke Politte, 15, both of University City, wore their long, baggy cotton bermudas and T-shirts as they shared a single pair of skates. A tennis shoe apiece finished their outfits and helped them execute skate-board like tandem maneuvers on the blades.  Neither wore pads or other protective gear.  With the exception of a pair of goggles over at the St. Peter's School lot, no other protective gear was to be found, except on two well-padded goalies.  Says Remmy, of the Alpine Shop and an active blader himself, ''If my kid was playing roller hockey, I'd put a helmet with a mask on him . . . hockey gloves, knee pads and elbow pads. . . . Probably the most important thing to say is that there are not enough people with protective gear.'' And, indeed, at St. Peter's, just as a game was heating up, a puck hit Brent Hoeman's stick and traveled upward, cutting him just above his right eyebrow. The cut eventually took eight stitches.  The school was closed that day for a religious holiday, but principal Maureen Jones happened to be there. She applied ice to the cut and called Hoeman's grandmother.  Boys rallied around Hoeman, asking him how he felt.  ''This is only the third incident,'' one boy said of roller-hockey injuries there. ''We don't try to hurt anybody.'' ''He's had a bad week,'' another chimed in.  ''Did you see Brent's cut?'' asked another, eyes widening. ''Big time.'' A check with several area hospital s turned up few reported injuries from roller blading. No such injuries were cited at St. Joseph Hospital of Kirkwood, for instance. And at Barnes Hospital, media coordinator David Trousdale said an emergency-room spokesman reported seeing ''occasional very minor injuries of abrasions and lacerations due to falls'' from the in-line skates, ''which can be difficult to stop.'' St. Louis Children's Hospital's spokesman Dave Welborn said, ''We really haven't seen an increase...of kids injured on roller blades.'' But, he said the hospital's director of emergency services ''definitely recommends pads for elbows and knees, plus helmets.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in the Meramec Valley School District will be asked on June 4 to increase the district's tax rate by 48 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation.  The money would be used for operating expenses and to pay for salary increases for teachers, said Superintendent Edward Hillhouse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal needs a simple majority to pass. The district is mainly in eastern Franklin County, with small parts in St. Louis and Jefferson counties.  The district's tax rate last year was $2.23. If passed, the increase would add $45.60 to the school tax bill of the owner of a house worth $50,000.  Hillhouse said the increase is needed to hire two teachers at Coleman school and a part-time kindergarten teacher at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> School.  The district also wants to install a computer lab at Robertsville School and to buy new reading series for pupils in kindergarten through third grade.  Hillhouse said the district is considering a bid of $69,000 for the series from Houghten and Mifflin Inc.  Some of the money would be used for teacher salary increases. Teachers will not be getting a raise in the next school year, Hillhouse said.  The district also wants to consider expanding counseling services, he said.  Hillhouse said the district's last operating tax increase occurred 17 years ago. In that time, voters have approved two bond issues, one seven years ago for $3 million and the other three years ago for $3.1 million. Hillhouse said that money went to build Truman School and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> School and for renovations at existing schools.  Hillhouse said each school has been promoting the tax proposal.  ''Everybody I've talked to has said they're with us,'' Hillhouse said.  ''We've received no organized opposition.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DANA BRAET is a good sport. Winter or summer, weekday or holiday, he spends atleast an hour running, cycling or hiking around Forest Park, the Katy Trail or Chubb Trail near Lone Elk Park. He also tries to find time for a little skiing or snowboarding on trips to a previous home in Boulder, Colo.  And he's certified as a full-time sports-massage therapist, working with, among other clients, the athletes of the 1990 Goodwill Games.  All of this is to say that Braet seemed like a natural choice when StyleWest went looking for someone knowledgeable to model - even give unofficial comments on - some of the best of new winter sporting clothes.  And there are a lot of them on the market right now.  They are as technical as they are stylish and colorful.  Trademarked names for the fabrics might overwhelm a shopper looking, for the first time, for ''dry warmth,'' as the sports-minded retailers call properties in Gore-Tex, Entrant, Silmond, Thermax, Therma Fleece, Polarplus, Polartec, Supplex, Capilene, Synchilla, Hydrofil, H2No Storm and Thinsulate, to name a few. Many of these fabrics are designed either to ''wick'' chilling moisture away from the skin or to transmit the moisture beyond to the outer layer of clothing, while keeping body heat in.  They make up a maze of new wintertime athletic apparel. But they also are features in clothing for anyone wanting to stay warm, not just the athletes among us. And this maze can be navigated with a little bit of help.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, for instance, is a closer look at five outfits worn by Braet. Retailers also provided some details.  Because mountain biking is one of his favorite sports, Braet tried on two sets of clothes suitable for cycling, on- and off-trail.  It should be said, at the outset, that his preference is for simple tights and top of stretchy Lycra - perhaps covering a layer of wicking underwear in cold weather - and all under a simple, lightweight shell.  So it wasn't a surprise that he liked the stretch elements in Pearl Izumi's new lightweight Therma Fleece tights - made of a Lycra woven with a fleeced surface inside. A jersey on top was of Thermasoft - a wind-resistant nylon fabric with fleece inner layer - and both were worn under a lightweight Pearl Izumi jacket of Silmond, a water-resistant fabric made of micro-filaments.  ''It's a new trend in mountain biking to have your micro-fiber shell,'' said Debbie Buzzotta, a buyer for Tourin g Cyclist shops, ''because you ride through a lot of wet grass and muddy conditions. So having something that repels water is very important.'' Braet said the pieces provided ''something that's comfortable, that stretches where you need it to stretch. How it fits your body is important, with nothing binding.'' The gloves, meanwhile, were lined with Thinsulate - a thin-fleeced fabric - and covered with stretch-Entrant, a treated polyester for water resistance but breathability.  A second cycling outfit was designed for much more difficult winter weather. Also by Pearl Izumi, it was of bright yellow, non-stretch Entrant in a jacket over pants, with knees inset with stretch material. The outfit is from what's called a ''foul weather collection,'' said Buzzotta. Braet found them to be a good fit and comfortable to stand around in on this particularly cold winter day. But he said that unlike ''another half of the population who will say, 'this is just right,' it has to be real cold before I wear Gore-tex'' or, in this case, the similar fabric of Entrant. Braet said he has a metabolism that makes working out in water-repellent pieces unbearably hot.  He added that he is grateful, however, for all of these technical breakthroughs in fibers and treated fabrics. Years ago, when ''this kind of stuff just didn't exist, you had to wear lots of heavier layers. Before Lycra, I just wore two layers of polypropylene'' he said, referring to a first synthetic treatment used in long underwear, ''and a pair of jeans.'' A helmet is imperative in any kind of cycling, he added. One that's tested and approved by the Snell laboratories is preferable, Buzzotta said.  ''Always wear a helmet,'' Braet emphasized. ''I've only ridden without one when it's just so darn cold that I've had to wear a number of layers on my head, and a helmet just wouldn't fit. If it's too cold to wear your helmet,'' he said, ''then you don't need to ride.'' Buzzotta also stressed the importance of ''the right pair of shoes, especially on a mountain bike. The shoe has to slip into a toe clip or have a cleat on bottom to hook into pedals,'' she said. ''It also has to have some tread, like a hiking shoe, for walking (with a bike) and getting it up hills.'' For winter hiking without a bike, Braet tried on Patagonia's bright-red, unlined ''guide shell'' made of an H2No Storm coating on nylon, from Outdoors Inc. ''It's not as breathable as Gore-Tex,'' said Rick Washburn, manager at Outdoors, ''but rather than being a membrane that Gore-Tex is, it's a coating on nylon that is highly water resistant. And it has a mesh liner to keep nylon away from the skin.'' Wasburn recommended wearing Patagonia's lightweight Capilene underwear, to wick away any moisture from a strenuous, cold-weather hike, and also Patagonia's shell of fleecy Synchilla, between the under- and outerwear.  Another Patagonia item, a ''duck bill'' cap from Outdoors Inc., was a runaway favorite of Braet's. Made of fleece in the shape of a baseball cap - with fleecy ear flaps to wear down or tuck inside - the cap, said Braet, was ''excellent. That one could be worn running, or cycling underneath the helmet.  I was warm in that.'' Said Washburn, ''The way old stocking-style caps are worn, half the ear is exposed all the time. Ear flaps allow you to cover ears all the way.'' The cap is a relatively new style and represents ''the first time Patagonia used the fleece in this particular way.'' For yet another favorite sport - running - Braet usually wears the Lycra tights, again, and ''some kind of Lycra top, with a shell, pretty much all year. The most I would add is maybe another layer on the fingers and maybe another layer on the pants, if it's real windy.'' Also from Patagonia, at Backwoods, came something a little different.  It is a new, stretch Synchilla - Patagonia's fleecy-warm polyester fabric which this year comes in a lighter, 7.5-ounce-per-yard weight, with a small percentage of stretch fiber woven in. Regular Synchilla is 11 ounces per yard and used in some of the heavier pullovers and jackets, already mentioned.  Braet wore the stretch version as tights and a top under a nylon shell.  ''The stretch Synchilla was really comfortable,'' said Braet, after trying a brief running workout in the two pieces, plus light nylon jacket. ''At first I didn't like it. I just thought it looked like pajamas or something. As soon as I got it on, it was just part of you. It had no binding quality.'' On his feet were another new item, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Mowabb boots, designed for the ''cross training'' purposes of mountain bikers, hikers and trail runners.  He liked those, too. And Patagonia's lightweight Capilene glove liners were just right for running, he said. An ''expedition weight'' of the Capilene liners also came from Outdoors Inc. and would be good for colder days, he said.  Another crossover of merchandise came from a source called Earth Monster - a company making winter-sports headbands and hats out of Ozark, Mo.  An Earth Monster headband - with et hnic-look cotton weavings on the outside, warming synthetic fabric inside - came from Backwoods.  The Alpine Shop had funky Earth Monster berets and hats for snowboarding, the final sport Braet was outfitted for.  Said Lisa Kircher, a buyer for the Alpine Shop, ''Snowboarding is probably the hottest thing in Alpine skiing. 'Riding the board,' it's called, and it's very elegant and graceful looking.'' Meanwhile the clothes for those who do snowboard - mostly young men in their teens, 20s and into their 30s - look less elegant, more like surfing gear, mountain style.  Braet wore Burton's knee-padded pants, of a breathable, water-resistant nylon-like black fabric, under a wildly decorated Burton ''shell jacket'' pullover, plus a vest. The shell and pants ''have a mesh lining, a wicking material,'' Kircher said, ''to wick moisture away. It's a very active sport.'' Patagonia's Capilene long underwear, she added, is what ''we think is the best to wear'' underneath the snowboarding clothes. ''And in extreme conditions, we would not use cotton as the second layer. We'd use, preferably, another wicking layer, Capilene or something not cotton. Cotton probably feels best to people next to the skin, but it holds moisture and doesn't transport it in cold weather.'' Braet, indeed, got a little cold while waiting to model the snowboarding outfit. But he said that when he changed clothes, he'd left on only his cotton T-shirt and black cycling shorts as protection underneath. ''I was cold, too, because I wasn't working out,'' said the man who's marathoned with the best in Colorado, as well as St. Louis. And the temperature was edging down into the teens from a high of 28 that day. The funky clothes, meanwhile, looked just right, he said, and ''would be comfortable for that sport.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Add this to the things that Bo knows: frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a first for all-everything Bo Jackson, who has built a spectacular career through football and baseball, plus megabucks product endorsements and a best-selling autobiography - all with an image of versatile indomitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo knows, Bo shows, Bo blows away obstacles with talent and iron will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every obstacle, that is, except one - a hip injury that in mid-January seemed a temporary setback but appeared serious enough Monday to cost him at least one of his multimillion-dollar hobbies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, 28, suffered cartilage damage in the joint of his left hip Jan. 13 playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in the NFL playoffs. On Monday, the Kansas City Royals, who agreed last month to pay him $ 2.375 million this year, became convinced he wouldn't be able to play baseball at least this season. Facing a deadline today to get out of the deal for one-sixth of that amount, the Royals released their former All-Star outfielder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's tragic that this happened,'' says Royals General Manager Herk Robinson, suggesting that if Jackson had used his off-seasons to tune baseball skills instead of playing pro football, he might have been ''the greatest player to wear our uniform.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't write the farewell tribute just yet, says Jackson: ''Don't count me out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Richard Woods, Jackson's lawyer: ''All that stuff about a career- ending injury is a crock. Bo's career is not over. We expect him to play this year. And if not this year, next year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25 other major-league teams have until Friday afternoon to claim rights to Jackson - and assume responsibility for his salary - or he will be free to negotiate a new deal with any team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royals had made no secret of their annoyance at Bo's insistence on playing football. And Bo has taken his swings at Royals management. In Bo Knows Bo, the book he wrote last year with Dick Schaap, Jackson hinted he'd just as soon play elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure in the last few days to talk to reporters, Jackson's frustration has been obvious. He cursed at a Kansas City photographer Monday morning in the Orlando, Fla., airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, says Woods, ''when Bo was told the news (of his release), it put a big smile on his face. We are extremely pleased with what's going on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods argues that Jackson's Birmingham, Ala., doctor, Jim Andrews, disagrees with the Royals' pessimistic view of Bo's future: ''Jim Andrews is confident that Bo will be playing baseball again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year? And what about football? Endorsements? And what would it be like for Jackson to sit out a season for the first time in his life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some tentative answers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Football. ''It's not something that's on his mind right now,'' says Woods. ''If he plays too soon, it could cause permanent injury. But there's no question, subject to what the doctor says, that Bo's heart is in putting on the cleats and pads and playing football again. It could well be that he'll sit out the baseball season and play a full season of football.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if his injury prevents him from playing with the Raiders next season, he'll earn $ 1.1 million plus another $ 516,000 in bonuses because his contract is guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Off the field. Bo is as famous for his ''Bo knows'' commercials for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes as for his exploits on the football and baseball fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obviously, Bo's injury may have an impact'' on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> schedule for future commercials, says spokeswoman Liz Dolan. ''So, like other people, we're waiting to see him get well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolan insists </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will stand by Jackson. ''We have never canceled a contract with an athlete due to an injury. Unfortunately, injury is part of sports, and we understand that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the impact on Jackson's marketability if he's out for a season or longer is another question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I hope Bo is so big that his posters would continue to sell, but we have to be realistic,'' says Aaron Pepper of Starline, which makes and sells sports posters. Often, he says, ''it's out of sight, out of mind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Timmerman of Sports Impressions, a company that makes and sells miniature figurines of athletes, says if Jackson is out of action for a prolonged period, ''there's no doubt it's going to hurt him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, using active players as product models is ''like playing the stock market or riding a wave,'' says Timmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the public starts to cool on Bo, so will advertisers, says Timmerman. And the superstar might find companies less willing to indulge his scheduling demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He does what he wants to do when he wants to do it,'' says Timmerman. ''That's OK when you're a phenomenon. It's not OK if you're not. The public is so fickle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cramer Products in Gardner, Kan., sent out a memo Monday to its sales staff to head off worries over how its new sports-medicine line, Bo Med pads and braces, would be affected by Jackson's injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Bo Jackson will continue to be the driving force behind the Bo Med line, regardless of the severity of his injury, regardless of his future as an athlete,'' wrote Cramer president Mike Vineyard. ''If anything, the concept of 'Bo knows sports medicine' will be even more credible than in the past.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- His attitude. There's no hiding Jackson's frustration at sitting on the sidelines. He told reporters when he announced his intention to play two pro sports that he would only get in trouble if he had all that spare time in the baseball off-season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although injuries have plagued Jackson since his days at Auburn University, seldom have they kept him out of action for long. The hip injury has been different, requiring long hours of therapy that seems to have had little effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royals manager John Wathan made an effort to talk to Jackson recently ''because I heard from some of the guys that he was down. He was tired of therapy and having nothing happening. He was getting tired of seeing everybody play (in spring training) and he couldn't. He genuinely missed playing baseball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People forget that he's a human being. They don't realize he has feelings. He's sensitive and feeling. He's had to have a bulletproof vest just to survive the people that hound him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a tough time for an athlete.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Jackson has made a habit of turning adversity to his favor. And he has his own ideas of what rehabilitation will require.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods says that when he read the details of his release, Jackson said, ''You mean I don't have to be with the team? I can hunt and fish all summer.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Contributing: Carol Herwig, Hal Bodley, Mel Antonen, Gordon Forbes and Jerry Bonkowski</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That attention came after a U.S. Open spectator was killed by lightning Thursday. ARA markets $ 395 M-10 Optical Lightning Detectors, a radar and camera system the size of a Walkman that is billed as more effective than lightning detectors on airplanes. Pro golf officials and about 200 golf course pros already use the device, says Gallagher. The company hopes to expand to other outdoor sports - especially boating.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developed by ARA president and ex-MIT physicist Ralph Markson, the device detects ''intracloud lightning'' invisible to the human eye, to sense lightning 20 minutes away. Sometimes, says Gallagher, the device finds that ''threatening-looking clouds aren't really threatening.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike/</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABCD Basketball Camp, the swoosh-stripe fashion show that doubles as a showcase for the USA's most dazzling high school boys basketball talent, concluded last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants hailed it as one of the best ever. Although the camp stresses academics, featuring five hours of classwork daily, its dribbles might be numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A controversial piece of legislation from the National Association of Basketball Coaches is aimed at reining in summer camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NABC says the current system fails in several areas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- It allows third parties to exert influence over prospects in recruiting or act as middlemen between players and college coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- It forces coaches to crisscross the country for all of July to put in appearances watching prospects; such appearances are believed to be essential in wooing recruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That runs at odds with cost-cutting measures the NCAA is trying to enforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's an area that's totally unregulated,'' said University of Southern California coach George Raveling, chairman of the NABC Recruiting Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee recommends that the NCAA start regulating. Its suggestion: nine NCAA-sponsored regional camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendation goes before the NCAA Council July 31. If it passes, it will be forwarded to the NCAA convention in January, where university presidents will vote on it as a two-year pilot program to be implemented in summer 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it has a real good chance of passing,'' said Rick Evrard, NCAA director of legislative services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the NABC plan, only high school seniors-to-be (not other underclassmen) would be invited to its camps, at a cost of $ 75, and only high school coaches would work at the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, these would be the only camps college coaches are permitted to attend, which presumably would put talent shows like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the shoebox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's ludicrous,'' said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coordinator Sonny Vaccaro, the man who outfits his 120 campers in shoes, shirts and shorts - and the man whom some call the most powerful in college basketball because of his shoe deals with dozens of the game's top coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's blind. And the reasons aren't good enough for me to believe that what they're trying to do is for the best interests of the kids.''<BR>Raveling stressed he is merely the chairman of the NABC's Recruiting Committee, not a lone firebrand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm interested in who these people are who think it's a slim chance,'' he said. ''They're certainly not the people who vote on it. ... A lot of coaches want to demonstrate to adminstrators they're on the same page.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raveling said he has been banned from three camps for his advocacy of a new summer system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only camp Raveling would name that he said has banned him is Dave Krider's All-American camp in Cincinnati. Krider also is sports editor for the La Porte (Ind.) Herald-Argus and picks all-USA teams for USA TODAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raveling said players are saying they feel pressured to attend Krider's camp in order to boost chances of being all-USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't promise kids anything,'' Krider said. ''I have never, ever told kids anything as far as my position at USA TODAY helping them in any way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krider's camp made its debut last year. He and partner Bobby Kortsen charged coaches $ 200 for Kortsen's scouting service - which they had to buy in order to gain access to floor seating at the University of Cincinnati's Shoemaker Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krider, who will charge only $ 15 this year, claims some schools spend more than $ 20,000 on recruiting, ''so how much is $ 200 really?'' Krider also alleges that at their camps, Bill Cronauer (BC Camp) and Howard Garfinkel (Five Star) have sold private information on prospects. Garfinkel could not be reached, but Cronauer denies the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divisiveness among camps, Raveling said, keeps them from presenting a united front to discuss the issue with the NABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everyone is pointing his finger at the other guy,'' he said. ''There's a need for regulation. You can't even get five of them in the same room to arbitrate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several college coaches scouting Vaccaro's camp had reservations about the new proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's mixed, I think,'' Georgetown's John Thompson said of the coaches' reaction. ''I think a lot of guys are for it because of what they perceive it to be: They perceive it to be something where the NCAA will take total supervision and there will be no influences at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''. ... But is the NCAA capable of administering a camp? Let's stop and think about that. They can't even administer enforcement services; they don't have enough people. Where's the (camp) staff going to come from? Where's the funding going to come from?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jimmy Connors' run in the U.S. Open had an unusual footnote: He must actually believe that if the shoe fits, wear it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connors has a shoe endorsement deal with Converse that runs through 1993. The company plans to give him his own shoe in a new line due in the fall of 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in reaching the Open semifinals, Connors wore all-white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''It wasn't a business relationship,'' says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liz Dolan, who says Connors was outfitted in July. ''He's just a guy who needed good shoes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Converse, publicly, isn't concerned. ''We're just glad he played well,'' says spokeswoman Kathy Button. ''And he had our socks on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connors' agent Ray Benton doesn't see a problem. ''It was just a short- term thing,'' says Benton. ''He was just testing some other (shoes).''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to consumers, however, the shoe might be on the other foot. According to a leading national survey by Video Storyboard Tests Inc., 54% of consumers say celebrity endorsers are ''just doing it for the money.'' The survey claims just 15% say celebrity plugs might make them more interested in a product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connors' latest venture: Pepsi TV ads.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> GLOBALL: Nostalgic for the way things used to be? Consider the World Basketball League's ball, which teachers could use to explain pre-Industrial Revolution life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Memphis-based league, which uses players under 6-5 and plays teams outside North America, wanted a trademark ball that looked good on TV and could be sold to fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the WBL's international flavor, a leather ball that looked like a globe was an obvious aesthetic - if not practical - choice. But major manufacturers refused the job, citing production costs. Finally, entrepreneur Rich Ledenican of Windsor, Colo., agreed to handmake them in his garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prototypes suffered from continental drift - and some player reluctance. ''One player turned to a ref,'' says WBL Commissioner Steve Ehrhart, ''and said Africa came off.'' Another player tried to hide the globe ball before tip-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WBL now says the ball is OK - and on sale for $ 150. But don't hold your breath for your order: Each ball takes about eight hours to produce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trainers which adorn the feet of athletes and fashion-conscious youth are truly space-age. Sue Moore reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legions of high-technology trainers are pounding urban pavements, their tongues hanging out. To traditionalists the conspicuous white glare of the chunky new sports shoes makes them seem as if they have landed from outer space. Appearances are not entirely deceptive. A closer look at the complicated internal workings of the trainers on display in the Science Museum's ''Running on Air'' exhibition reveals that the design of these fashionable shock absorbers for feet has its origins in space travel technology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition traces the history of the air-cushioning system in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> company's sports shoes, which is based on an idea originally developed by an aerospace engineer, Frank Rudy. Studying the effects of the pressurised gas bags that let lunar modules land safely, Mr Rudy saw an alternative use for the concept. It was transposed to ski boots in the early Seventies, proved useful in ice hockey skates and basketball boots, and eventually, after Mr Rudy approached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the idea, it was designed into the 1979 Tailwind, the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe to use air-cushioning to support a foot. Subsequent models have included inflatable collars, and cutaway windows in the soles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These high-technology developments are far removed from the customised clodhoppers which are the ancestors of today's lightweight sports shoes. Well into the late 19th century, rugby players and footballers tramped about the playing fields in hobnailed workboots. There was no such thing as a specifically designed sports shoe in Britain until 1876, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company produced a lightweight canvas croquet shoe with a vulcanised rubber soul. It swiftly earned the nickname ''plimsoll'', because the join between upper and sole resembled the loading lines painted on ships' hulls then being advocated by Samuel Plimsoll. The basic shape of the plimsoll remains a design classic, current in contemporary sneakers and deck shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vulcanised rubber still makes regular appearances in the soles of modern sports shoes, but in recent years the proliferation of new polyurethanes, foams and nylons has given shoe designers an impressive range of ingredients from which to develop comfortabl and supportive trainers. Although uppers come in eye-catching colours and complicated fretwork connecting up to 30 separate pieces, the most innovative design technology is used to construct the soles. The 6ft models on show at the Science Museum reveal how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''air support'' soles are put together, and demonstrate the uses of each kind of material. Energetic visitors can give a hammering to a variety of different soles, imitating the rigorous testing of new designs at the company's sports research laboratory in Oregon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technological and biomechanical expertise invested in new trainer design reflects the manufacturers' belief that their products are primarily sports shoes. Whether that claim remains strictly true today is debatable, but certainly in their first incarnation, the shoes were designed by athletes for athletes. The founder of Reebok, Joseph William Foster, was a keen amateur runner. In 1892, frustrated by the weighty footwear on the market, he designed and made one of the first pairs of specialised spiked running pumps for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impressed by the design, fellow athletes in the Bolton Primrose Harriers running club put their orders in, and by the turn of the century Foster had set up the family business that later became Reebok International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first half of the 20th century, requests from athletes for perfect running shoes set ever more demanding briefs for designers. Extra weight was shed, and less very definitely meant more. In 1938, when the sprinter, C.B.Holmes, won the Commonwealth Games 220yd race, he wore a very special pair of Foster's shoes. Their rubber soles were so thin that each pair lasted for only one race. Holmes ran his way through three separate pairs of pumps in the heat, semi-final and final before winning the gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the close connection between manufacturers and athletes continues, trainers are no longer elite sporting equipment. Twenty-five years ago, when New Balance produced the first wide-based running shoe designed on orthopaedic principles, it was available only through a special mail-order service to athletes. Now the designs which were originally intended to improve the speed and performance of serious athletes have gained highly marketable street credibility. Now New Balance shoes grace the feet of couch potatoes everywhere. They, and every other piece of technologically advanced sports footwear, are not just for the fit, but for the fashion conscious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tennis player Andre Agassi may be more famous for his endorsements than for his game. And, in his new ad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he's paired with Julia Child, the grande dame of food who has always refused to endorse any product.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;Air. By Agassi&quot; spot, the Las Vegas flash bashes tennis balls around a profusion of TV sets. He hits one of the sets with a ball and Child suddenly appears on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child, who never does commercials endorsing products, says the TV spot resulted from a &quot;snafu with my lawyers when the company asked for a clip from one of my shows&quot; and her share of the royalties is being donated to the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dusty Kidd, director of public relations for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, says Child was concerned that her spot not appear as an endorsement for the shoes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chose Child, Kidd said, because she is a TV institution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional court wear is being shoved aside for the wildest tennis fashions in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say hello to bright neons and bold jewel tones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifteen years ago, whites were white but that's no longer the case,&quot; said Charles Zimmerman, customer service supervisor for Adidas Canada.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennis wear is now anything but predictable.Traditional tennis skirts now come with lycra shorts sewn inside.  Or forget the skirt.  Lycra shorts are hip alone or under white tennis shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or ditch the white shorts.  Tennis shorts now come in an array of denim.  There's washed denim, distressed denim in black, and various hues of blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bland tennis shirts have gotten an image boost.  Many come with zippers and in neon patterns.  Narrow cuts have been loosened up and some shirts come with a tail at the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest swing has been the shift away from white.  Industry leaders like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have added Persian violet, clear turquoise, hot lime and neon teal to their summer collections.  Fall pushes the swing further with tennis blacks holding centre court, said Ruth Heaven, national apparel manager for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a move to the extreme since black has never been on the court before,&quot; said Heaven.  &quot;Black has always been the number one body color and outsells all other colors.  It's a easy sell because it's practical and you can mix it into other things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The break from bland has a lot to do with American tennis sensation Andre Agassi.  The fashion-forward dynamo is revolutionizing tennis wear with his penchant for flash, says Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sixth-ranked player created a stir at Wimbledon this year when he showed up in white.  Long known for his untraditional tennis garb, sports commentators were predicting he'd break tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his long, dyed-blond hair, earring and funky tennis wear in bright colors like lime, Agassi is turning a staid game on its ear, said Dan Orman of Freeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players, whose own fashions tend to mirror their favorite stars, have been snapping up offbeat wear which often comes in matching shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our zipper front tennis shirt has been one of our biggest sellers,&quot; said Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Younger players love the look of Agassi-inspired tennis wear, said Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agassi may lose but he's liked by all the little girls and youth out there,&quot; she said.  &quot;He's a rebel and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (which pays royalties to Agassi for wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clothing) likes it.  It's fun, agressive and different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While younger players favor the look, older player's don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adults hate the Agassi look,&quot; said Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most prefer classic tennis whites, she added.  So do many clubs which place restrictions on the amount of non-white players can wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Color tends to mask or hide the ball, said Zimmerman.  9</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The greying of jockdom is apparent all along Madison Avenue. At 39, Jimmy Connors is urging headache sufferers to &quot;Nupe it with Nuprin&quot; in television commercials and print advertisements created by J. Walter Thompson. Soon, BBDO Worldwide will add the tennis player to the roster of celebrities featured in Diet Pepsi's continuing &quot;You've got the right one baby, uh-huh!&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connors is one of a teamful of sports stars with wrinkled brows beneath their headbands or receding hairlines under their helmets who are becoming more popular in advertising and as product endorsers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising and sports executives attribute the growing appeal of aging athletes to their popularity with the baby-boom generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new print ad by Wieden &amp; Kennedy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> footwear, Nolan Ryan, who is 44, appears alongside an inspirational text that insists: &quot;It's easier to keep going if you never stop. Just do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in another print ad just coming out, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York for Duracell Inc., a photograph of the Texas Rangers pitcher in action appears under the headline, &quot;He runs like he's on Duracell.&quot; These ads follow the pitcher's campaigns for Advil pain reliever, by Young &amp; Rubicam New York, and Wrangler jeans, by the Martin Agency Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boxing's George Foreman, 42, co-stars with Bo Jackson in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spot also created by Wieden; when Jackson walks out of a singing-and-dancing spot-within-the-spot, Foreman eagerly fills in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez, 55, is featured in ads for Toyota, by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Inc., and the Nestle Crunch candy bar, by Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the 76 million consumers born between 1946 and 1964 get older, &quot;they respond to the guys and girls who hang tough and defy the odds,&quot; Scott Bedbury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising director, said in a telephone interview from his office in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;The Nolan Ryan ad is all about still doing it after all these years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is &quot;kind of a wonderful confluency of celebrities and audience identification with them,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, director of the Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connors was a natural for Nuprin, said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York, because the baby boomers &quot;are the people beginning to get the muscle aches.&quot; Thompson signed the tennis star before his surprising success at the U.S. Open, Patterson added, but rushed to create additional ads to capitalize on his march to the semifinals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reason older athletes are becoming so visible is that they have known track records, meaning there are likely to be fewer surprises for advertisers and agencies. By contrast, a younger star-in-the-making still adjusting to the glare of the limelight can be caught, Patterson said, &quot;in a peccadillo on the front page,&quot; jeopardizing his or her value as an endorser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all their rising popularity, aging athletes have a lap or two to go before threatening the advertising livelihoods of the most successful limber-limbed, fuzzy-cheeked younger athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Jordan makes an estimated $ 15 million to $ 20 million a year through more than a dozen deals with marketers including Quaker Oats (Gatorade), General Mills (Wheaties), General Motors (Chevrolet) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And Magic Johnson earns about $ 12 million a year from advertisers including Pepsi-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nestle Crunch, which signed him Monday to be its principal pitchman, starting in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a danger that older athletes will diminish their worth to advertisers by risking what Lanktree called the &quot;humiliation and embarrassment&quot; of playing past their primes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the phenomenon can continue to build, executives say, as athletes extend their playing careers by taking better care of themselves. One who could be in for big ad paydays nationally, Lanktree said, is Carlton Fisk, 43, catcher for the Chicago White Sox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of baseball icons, you ain't seen nothing yet,&quot; Patterson agreed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For college basketball fanatics, the four-day banquet of the NCAA tournament's first round leaves them fat and happy on the sofa, blissfully bloated from an all-consuming smorgasbord of backdoor screens and matchup zones. But now it's time for the Alka Seltzer, courtesy of Bill Moyers and public television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality of big-time college athletics -- fat-cat boosters, sleazy recruiters, academically deficient athletes, the television-fueled chase for the big money -- makes up the meat and potatoes of Moyers's 90-minute documentary &quot;Sports For Sale&quot; that will air tonight at 9 on WETA-TV-26. After that Moyers will moderate a live 30-minute panel discussion with members of the Knight Foundation's Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, the group that has been investigating college sports for the last year and a half and will release its recommendations earlier today. A 60-minute call-in show will follow, a grand total of three television no-commercial hours of what's really wrong with big-time sports in America today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyers and producer Howard Weinberg have spent the last year trying to find out, shooting major segments on troubled programs at Southern Methodist University and Iowa State and the summer meat market known as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball recruiting camp in Princeton, N.J., with many stops elsewhere around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, there's not much new ground broken here. Most of these stories have been done by every major news magazine and newspaper in America (some minor ones, too). There have been countless books on the subject, not to mention national study commissions that go back to the turn of the century when Theodore Roosevelt was so horrified by the alarming death rate in college football he implemented a federal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, this is one tale that can't be told enough, even if most followers of college sports seem to care more about points-per-game than grade-points, and, by the way, tailgate at 11 in parking lot C, you bring the fried chicken, I'll buy the beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, the show is about money, and how the economics of stadiums filled to capacity and athletic budgets driven by billion-dollar television contracts have turned college sports into something Moyers says &quot;they never were intended to be . . . . Television has made the difference. It's transported it from entertainment in the local community to entertainment for the whole country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also taken the student out of the student athlete. Consider this. When Andrew Gaze arrived from Australia to help Seton Hall get to the Final Four two years ago, he was taking courses in first aid, youth activities, creative movement and ethics. Four days after the tournament ended, Gaze said g'day and left school. Or how about Iowa running back Ronnie Harmon, who was eligible to play football despite grade-points of 1.62, 1.86 and 1.69 (on a 4.0 scale), with courses that included bowling, billiards and water colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyle Carroll, a tackle on the SMU football team, talks about the reality of school and sports when he says, &quot;It's really hard to study. The first thing you want to do [after practice] is climb into bed, watch a little TV and turn off the lights. A normal student can take a nap. With us, the day is so filled, it's hard to get going at the end of the day because you're so exhausted . . . . It's not a game, it's a business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp in Princeton, 140 of the country's best high school players are in attendance, with luminaries such as John Thompson and Bobby Knight taking notes in the stands. Filmmaker Spike Lee (a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman) addresses the campers and advises them to ask recruiters &quot;how many of your players are graduating.&quot; Then he tells them, &quot;It's all about money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most already know that. At the end of one segment, the camera focuses on an anonymous high school player who says: &quot;If a school makes it to the Final Four, the school gets millions and the players get nothing . . . . There's no such thing as a straight college playing by the rules . . . every college, every college, every college, slips up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the numbers cited by Moyers should be required reading for every college sports fan in America. For example, 30 percent of Division I football and basketball players graduate; one quarter of those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp players read below sixth grade level, including 10 who were functionally illiterate; Louisville's basketball program had a 16 percent graduation rate from 1981-90; none of the three seniors on Duke's 1990 Final Four team graduated with his class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyers provides no conclusions on camera, though in an interview he said he believes some problems would be solved by paying the players and conceding that big-time college sports are nothing more than minor league systems for the pros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That would at least end the hypocrisy,&quot; he said, adding that he's also looking forward to seeing what the Knight Commission has in mind today. He is not alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the athletic footwear giant, will contribute $ 5 million, the largest single corporate grant ever made for a children's educational television project. CTW has also committed some $ 6 million of its own funds ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centerpiece of the project will be a weekly, half-hour action-adventure drama called &quot;Ghostwriters,&quot; which is expected to premiere on PBS in the fall of 1992 ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to CTW president David Britt, &quot;Ghostwriters&quot; will feature &quot;a gang of six youngsters -- including black, Latino, Asian as well as white -- plus an invisible seventh, a ghost&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ghost, who is silent but whose words appear on the TV screen, will be the &quot;motivator,&quot; explained Britt, &quot;making the kids understand how important it is to express yourself well, to communicate, how reading and writing are relevant&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britt expects that each program will also include a celebrity guest who will &quot;read something&quot; and &quot;suggest a writing project -- maybe asking the kids to keep a diary for a week, things like that&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted that &quot; 'Ghostwriter' will capture the contemporary beat of MTV, the graphic look of print on screen, elements of the popular culture and a dramatic format to create the program and the excitement surrounding it&quot; ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bulk of the $ 20 million annual budget would be expended on a national campaign to reach children at home, in school and in community environments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of the campaign: 20 million copies of a mini-magazine to be distributed free in conjunction with the program; more than 200,000 copies of teachers' materials to be distributed through a variety of channels; a nationally syndicated weekly newspaper column; and two nationwide contests to be conducted during the show's first season ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the funds provided by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and CTW, PBS is contributing $ 2.8 million; the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, $ 1 million; and the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation, $ 100,000 ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is worthwhile making this kind of an investment because it lasts well beyond the period in which it's actually operating.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now ThisAt the last minute, somebody up in New York forgot to tell him about the mandatory drug tests at ABC so it wasn't until yesterday -- a day late -- that ABC News could officially announce that Tom Bettag has been named executive producer of &quot;Nightline&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the afternoon, he was in Washington to introduce himself to the staff of 15 at the News bureau and discuss the night's program with anchor Ted Koppel ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former executive producer of &quot;CBS Evening News With Dan Rather&quot; is no stranger to Washington. He began his broadcasting career as an assignment editor at the CBS News Washington bureau 22 years ago ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bettag, 46, is only the fourth executive producer in the 11-year history of the very successful late-night show. Bill Lord, Rick Kaplan and Dorrance Smith preceded him ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bettag said an increased emphasis on investigative reporting can be expected. He said the program does so superbly during crises -- such as the Persian Gulf War -- that the trick will be to maintain that kind of momentum. &quot;I think I've just got to remind them once in a while of just how good they are&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His predecessor, Smith, departed for the White House in March. Bettag said the fact that &quot;Nightline&quot; continued to operate without a glitch and without an executive producer for the next two months was another sign of &quot;just how strong this program really is&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will operate out of New York, where another 15-plus &quot;Nightline&quot; staffers work, at least for the time being. Manhattan-based ABC News president Roone Arledge likes to keep an eye on his executive producers ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more ABC notes: Arledge received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Boston University this past weekend. According to BU President John Silber, Arledge's &quot;programming innovations have transformed broadcast news reporting. You have increased the range of news coverage, developed new kinds of news programming such as 'Nightline' and dramatically increased the size of the television news audience. You are perhaps better known to the general public for your achievements in sports broadcasting, but we take particular note of your accomplishment in raising the industry standard for television news coverage; it is in this context that we propose to honor you&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a video salute prepared by producer Rhonda Roberts and videotape editor Rick Watkins at the ABC News bureau here will be shown to guests tonight at the annual White House News Photographers Association dinner, which will be held at the Washington Hilton ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video uses footage shot at home and in the Middle East as a tribute to the men and women who served in the Persian Gulf War and the members of the media who covered it ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video is about eight minutes long and is set to the music of M.C. Hammer's &quot;Can't Touch This&quot; and Whitney Houston's version of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network premiere of &quot; 'Crocodile' Dundee II&quot; Tuesday night earned a 13.6 national Nielsen rating and a 23 percent audience share between 9 and 11 and enabled CBS to win the evening ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over on ABC, the season finale of &quot;Roseanne&quot; averaged a 14.6/24, the penultimate episode of &quot;STAT&quot; did an 11.8/19 and an original &quot;thirtysomething&quot; -- during which Michael finally quit the agency!!! -- averaged a 9.4/16. If you're keeping track, the season finale (or worse!) of &quot;thirtysomething&quot; will be May 28 ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On NBC, &quot;Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin&quot; averaged a 12.8/22. A very good &quot;Shannon's Deal,&quot; which followed at 10, drew exactly the same number &quot;thirtysomething&quot; did for ABC. That is not good. Symmetrical, perhaps. But not good ...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WIMBLEDON, England, June 27, 1991</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one brief shining moment today, the sun came out and put a spotlight on Centre Court as if to announce that the suspense was finally over. For 72 hours Wimbledon had waited. And now, with the crowd atwitter and dozens of telephoto lenses fixed on the players' entrance, Andre Agassi was ready to make his appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he stepped onto the court at 3:45 this afternoon, the 21-year-old from Las Vegas wore his usual dangling earring and carried a Day-Glo orange racket and equipment bag. But as if to signal his reconciliation with tradition and with the rules of the All England Club, a white headband graced his wavy, died-blond locks and he wore a pristine white warm-up suit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was polite applause. But a question lingered. What was he wearing underneath the warm-up? He kept on the suit for seven more minutes -- through the coin toss and a practice period -- tantalizing the crowd of 13,000 until the precise moment that his match against Canadian Grant Connell began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outfit he unveiled more than complied with Wimbledon's &quot;predominantly white&quot; rule. To be exact, he wore white. All white. White shirt. White tennis shorts. White bicycle tights sewn into the shorts. White socks. White shoes. White trim. The only trace of color on his person was a small, black </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> logo on his shirt and socks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you know how boring all white can be,&quot; joked Ian Hamilton, director of tennis sports marketing for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sporting goods company, which pays Agassi endorsement fees to wear audacious clothes and shoes. &quot;But Andre really likes it. It's a nice change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi's outfit was only one reason that Day 4 of Wimbledon seemed a bit like theater of the absurd. Rain again washed out most of the matches, and vanished only long enough to allow Agassi and Connell to split their first two sets and the first two games of the third. Defending champion Stefan Edberg, who began his first-round match Tuesday after rain prevented any tennis Monday, played between showers this afternoon before he polished off Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Pete Sampras, the eighth-seeded player who also started Tuesday, had barely finished his 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory against Brazilian qualifier Danilo Marcelino when the clouds burst again. When play was halted, fourth-seeded Jim Courier led Frenchman Rodolphe Gilbert 5-4 in the first set, and 10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic was in the second set against England's Andrew Castle after winning the first in a tiebreaker. Meanwhile, Boris Becker, Ivan Lendl and Jimmy Connors continued their vigil in the locker room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, 52 matches have been played. The tournament is now approximately 200 matches behind schedule, causing men's doubles matches until the quarterfinals to be reduced to best-of-three sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As has happened often these rainy four days, the tennis itself got the least attention. Agassi had skipped the tournament since playing here for the first time in 1987, in part because Wimbledon tradition conflicted with his need for self-expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he meant was that he didn't want to play on grass courts or conform to the predominantly white clothing rule. Usually he wears faded black denim shorts, lime green or hot lava bicycle tights, black-and-neon-colored shirts, and headbands and shoes to match. But that combination would offend the sensibilities of the officials here, who months before the tournament begins require all players to submit samples of the shoes and clothes they plan to wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six months ago, when it seemed likely he would play Wimbledon this year, Agassi and his designers began working on several outfits and submitted them to tournament officials. &quot;We showed them a lot of things and they rejected a lot of things,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;Everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, Agassi settled on a few designs, including the one he wore today, that wouldn't violate the club's rules. It was Agassi's idea to play his first match in all white, Hamilton said. &quot;He wanted to start off on the right foot here. That's what they would like him to do, so that's what he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi's outfit is a replica of what he wore this month at the French Open, except instead of bright mandarin and voltage purple -- all color names are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inventions -- it was white. The shorts were white denim, with white Lycra bicyle tights fitted in them, and he wore his trademark baggy shirt, not tucked in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Agassi's multicolored clothing line is a major success for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the company has no plans to market the all-white design. &quot;I think our customers would be disappointed if we did,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;They expect more from us than all-white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi won't talk to reporters until his match is completed. But Hamilton said the fifth-seeded player has other clothing options for Wimbledon. &quot;Maybe the story isn't over yet,&quot; he said. &quot;We presented Andre with several choices which he still has at his disposal.&quot; Asked whether Agassi would wear today's outfit again when play resumes Friday, Hamilton smiled mischievously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only Andre knows,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRTC regulations require Canadian cable TV companies to substitute the signals from a U.S. station with those of a Canadian station if the programming is identical and broadcast at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So instead of having the gridiron action interrupted by American ads, Canadian fans will be inundated with Canadian commercials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., rival Pepsi has cancelled plans to counter Coke's promotion with singer Ray Charles giving away three $1 million prizes. Pepsi said plans to use an 800 number call-in could over-tax the nation's phone system in a time of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Pepsi-Cola Canada Ltd. executives were not available to discuss their Super Bowl ad plans here.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anheuser-Busch has been touting its third annual &quot;Bud Bowl,&quot; a fictional football match up between &quot;teams&quot; made up of different brands of the brewer's beer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEATTLE (Reuter) - A Seattle-based oceanographer believes that 80,000 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes will help explain the mysteries of trans-Pacific migration, the spread of oil spills and where bodies lost at sea will wash ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researcher, Curtis Ebbesmeyer, has been studying the path of the drifting sneakers and sport shoes to learn more about how ocean currents work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shoes - with a retail value of about $2.5 million - were accidentally dumped at sea in the Pacific Ocean by a freighter nearly 18 months ago and around 2,000 have washed ashore on West Coast beaches from Oregon to British Columbia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's had a lot of interest in these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where they fell in and where they drifted,&quot; said Shannon Flotre, a colleague at Evans-Hamilton Inc., a Seattle-area oceanography firm in which Ebbesmeyer is a co-owner and oceanographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebbesmeyer, who was not available for comment on his study, is a specialist on Puget Sound who also has expertise in statistics of drifting objects and keeps records on drifting portions of shipwrecks, icebergs and other matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data may help explain migration and anthropology of Pacific Island peoples and is frequently used in oil spill research and even in locating bodies lost overboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May, 1990, accident created the largest single drop of man-made drift objects in the North Pacific, surpassing 20,000 drift bottles dumped in the Pacific during the 1950s by a Canadian government research project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Hastings, transport manager at Beaverton, Ore.-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., said the cargo was bound for Seattle from Korea and apparently was lost about 600 miles due south of Anchorage, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do have an air cushioning system - some of the shoes had compressed air, which helped them float,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;I'm glad it can be at least some benefit. It's not littering the beaches because they're picked up as soon as they land.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, for whatever cockeyed reason, you wanted to cast a classical musician alongside a professional athlete in a sneaker commercial, you might find a likely candidate or two. But you would find a host of unlikely ones, and among the very least plausible would be the pianist Rudolf Firkusny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reserved and patrician in his bearing and in his playing, Mr. Firkusny, who lives in New York but was born in Napajedla, Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia), in 1912, is the epitome of old-world grace and gentility. &quot;I am not very much in the sport world,&quot; Mr. Firkusny said recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet there he is on television with David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, playing Chopin and, uh, basketball in a commercial for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea came from James Riswold, an admirer of Mr. Firkusny's piano-playing and a copywriter for the advertising agency Weiden &amp; Kennedy, based in Portland, Ore. Mr. Riswold's work in other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials has received wide acclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mr. Firkusny took part only in the final day of shooting, he said the process of repeated takes was exhausting, much as in a recording session. &quot;For the first time I realized that it's not such an easy life to be a movie actor,&quot; he added. But there were rewards. He reported gleefully that he made one basket -- a feat, alas, not shown in the commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now Mr. Firkusny revels in a new-found fame. &quot;Everybody saw it somehow,&quot; he said. &quot;My mailman told me he saw me on television. The druggist and my daughter's doctor saw it. That's the magic of television. I think it was good that for once serious music was put together with sports. Music needs all kinds of encouragement.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO, March 31</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operation PUSH, the Chicago civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, is going through a period of upheaval, struggling to reshape its identity in the face of financial troubles and the resignation of its executive director, the Rev. Tyrone Crider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUSH leaders say they are reassessing strategy, stepping up fund raising and reorganizing the management of the 20-year-old organization, whose initials stand for People United to Serve Humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In January, faced with a deficit of several hundred thousand dollars, the PUSH board announced the layoff of all 12 staff workers. The group has since raised more than $100,000, and officials say they hope to raise $1 million in the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Henry Williamson, the new president and chief executive officer, said that PUSH had &quot;put out the immediate financial fires&quot; and that he hoped to rehire the workers soon. Most have continued as volunteers, he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>'Time to Take Inventory'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robert T. Starks, an associate professor of political science at Northeastern Illinois University who has followed PUSH, said: &quot;This is a critical period for the organization. Their major mission will remain the same, but it's a time to take inventory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crider resigned this month, citing personal reasons, in what was widely seen as a response to PUSH's problems. The board then created a 20-member team to develop criteria for hiring a new director and reorganizing. PUSH has also begun a nationwide membership drive, with a goal of 100,000 new members this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although these moves seem to have been prompted by Mr. Crider's departure, many who have followed PUSH say the organization has floundered since 1989, when Mr. Jackson relinquished his leadership to move his legal residence to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson was in Chicago today to deliver an Easter sermon to more than 1,000 people at the Carter Temple Church, where Mr. Williamson is pastor. Referring to the Crucifixion, Mr. Jackson said, &quot;It wasn't the nails in His hands, painful as they were,&quot; but the fact that the people Jesus served had deserted Him. He urged the worshipers to contribute to PUSH.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Jackson Seen as the Key</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Compton, president of the Chicago Urban League, said, &quot;I tend to think that the key to the PUSH situation is the presence or lack of presence of Reverend Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some who are familiar with PUSH have said privately that it was losing influence even before Mr. Jackson left. Critics have charged that the group, which has long pressed for affirmative action and other efforts on behalf of minority workers and businesses, caters to middle-class blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few prominent black Chicagoans will openly criticize PUSH. But a letter published in The Chicago Tribune last fall reflects the views of some detractors. It said, &quot;The fact is that most blacks under 30 think of PUSH, along with several other civil rights organizations, as dinosaurs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUSH officials say such charges are untrue. They said PUSH's troubles rose from the downturn in the economy, which has heightened demands for the organization's services at the same time that contributions are down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We receive more than 150 calls each day,&quot; said the Rev. Willie Barrow, vice chairwoman of the PUSH board. Ms. Barrow said PUSH's financial troubles mirrored those of the corporate world.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Public Relations Failures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some public relations failures have hurt PUSH. Most prominent was a boycott of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the athletic-shoe manufacturer, over its hiring practices. Several prominent blacks opposed the boycott, which was widely perceived as a failure when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials refused to negotiate with PUSH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUSH leaders argue that the boycott, which began in August, has forced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as others in the athletic industry, to hire more blacks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has formed an advisory board to review the company's minority recruitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hiking boots, those heavy, bomb-proof wedges of leather and rubber that were all the rage on college campuses 20 years ago, have gone through a metamorphosis. They have emerged in a flutter of colorful, high-tech designs that weigh almost nothing and cost anywhere from $50 to $250. In the last few years, the popularity of these boots and their high-tech cousins -- low-cut, hiking shoes -- has spread far beyond the traditional outdoor-enthusiast market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the growth in this nearly $300 million market is the renewed interest in the environment and the shift -- especially among the aging baby-boom generation -- away from vigorous aerobics to the more family-friendly joys of walking, now the nation's leading form of exercise. And where baby boomers wander, the market follows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key word is wander. This new breed of hiking-boot buyer is typically not the traditional backpacker who spends weeks camping in the wilderness. The growth in demand for these lightweight boots and shoes has come from individuals and families for whom the occasional day hike or weekend camping expedition (with the kids and plenty of insect repellent) is quite enough, thank you. It has also come from that category of shoppers who are city-bound but dress as if they lived in the backwoods of Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market is growing and it's a very good mix of 50/50, men and women,&quot; said Joseph Guglielmetti, marketing director of Reebok International's outdoor unit in Stoughton, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing demand for colorful high-tech boots and shoes is also attracting new entrants into the market. Traditional hiking-boot manufacturers and athletic-shoe manufacturers are meeting halfway between the mountain and the gym to produce hiking shoes with running-shoe technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market has blurred,&quot; said Robert McGee, footwear editor at Sports Style. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok are bringing features from athletic shoes to outdoor boots and the outdoor people are moving from the hard core to the mainstream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>What's in Vogue<BR>Lighter Models Are Selling Fastest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the overall hiking-boot and shoe market is still a small slice of the $6.5 billion athletic and sport footwear market, sales are climbing. They jumped 17 percent last year to $295 million from $252 million in 1989, according to the National Sporting Goods Association. Sales have tripled since 1985. Because hiking is inexpensive and can be done close to home, said Pam Montgomery, marketing director at Outdoor Retailer, a trade magazine, the market is likely to remain robust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its 1991 buying guide, Backpacker Magazine, which is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts, listed 24 manufacturers offering more than 250 styles of lightweight hiking boots and shoes, often with suggestive names like Adventure, Escape, Free Spirit and Rambler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lightweight category, which now dominates the hiking-boot market, accounts for about 65 percent of all sales, according to Art Kenyon, president of Vasque, a unit of the Red Wing Shoe Company in Red Wing, Minn. Hiking shoes account for another 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, the boots weigh two pounds or less and cost about $100. Low-cut trail shoes weigh about the same but are half the price. The more traditional medium- and heavy-weight boots -- patterned after styles first developed in Italy in the early 1900's -- cost $150 to $200 and weigh three to four pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These older designs, once the mainstay of the industry, make up only 20 percent of the market. &quot;The big, heavy Italian-style shoe now only accounts for 5 to 10 percent of our sales,&quot; said Stephen Gladstone, marketing director at Merrell Footwear in South Burlington, Vt., which had sales of about $11 million last year. &quot;In the late 70's, that's all there was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one company has more than 5 percent of the market, according to Thomas B. Doyle, director of information and research at the National Sporting Goods Association, an industry group. &quot;There are many players out there with, relatively speaking, equal share of the market.&quot; K-Mart, which has its own brand, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Red Wing and Hi Tec Sports USA, are the market leaders with about 5 percent each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Timberland Company, in Hampton, N.H., which sold about $13 million worth of hiking boots last year, has been selling an in-between product for 20 years. Made of smooth, yellow leather, the low-cut boot is heavier than a lightweight but lighter than the traditional Italian boot, and it is suitable for camping, working or the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The factor that's fueling the growth in hiking boots right now is that the public is discovering these boots are quite practical for street use,&quot; said David Getchell, equipment editor at Backpacker Magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The Technology<BR>Borrowing Features of Running Shoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move toward lightweight hiking shoes started in the early 80's. According to Craig Duerr, a marketing manager at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Beaverton, Ore., it began with the people at the company who were interested in hiking. They complained that the only available boots were too heavy and clunky. &quot;Can't we make something that's lighter?&quot; he recalled them asking one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the first to jump into that segment,&quot; said Josie Esquivel, securities analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;They did their market research and found outdoor sports were becoming a very hot trend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most important characteristic manufacturers tout in their advertisements is the combination of lightness and strength, a result of the high-tech design. In an ad for its hiking shoe, Merrell Footwear claimed its patented air-cushion midsole &quot;takes running-shoe technology into the backcountry.&quot; A brochure for Vasque's Clarion line of lightweight boots shows a cross-section of a boot with references to a patented &quot;motion control device,&quot; a &quot;variable fit system,&quot; and a &quot;bumper-lug outsole.&quot; The point all the manufacturers are trying to convey is that running-shoe technology, applied to hiking boots, can provide greater comfort and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're taking athletic-shoe technology and applying it to other areas,&quot; said Reebok's Mr. Guglielmetti, citing the science of biomechanics, which has resulted in the lighter weights and superior shock absorption of modern athletic shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Behind the Success<BR>The Correct Politics on the Environment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typical of the athletic shoe manufacturer entering the &quot;green market&quot; is Reebok, which launched its new outdoor division last fall to target both the serious outdoor enthusiast and the general hiker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see the decade of the 90's as one of wellness, of getting out into the environment with the family,&quot; said Mr. Guglielmetti, who was a product manager with L.L. Bean, the mail-order outfitter in Freeport, Me., before joining Reebok Outdoor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fashion is also playing a role, with the new style of hiking boot combining the bright colors of the 80's active life style with the correct political line on the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a mental association, like the Jeep Cherokee,&quot; said Mr. Getchell. &quot;Most Jeeps never get mud higher than the hubcaps, but people like the idea they can go anywhere. Owning a pair of hiking boots is a way to enjoy some vicarious link to the wilderness even though you may be far removed from the woods.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>TRADITIONALISTS VS. INNOVATORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the athletic-shoe companies, with their massive advertising budgets, began to enter the outdoor market, many small manufacturers of traditional hiking boots were skeptical. Some of the purists questioned the motives and long-term commitment of the giants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see them as cynical, taking advantage of something we have been involved in from the very beginning,&quot; said Mr. Gladstone, of Merrell Footwear. The big manufacturers, according to Mr. Gladstone, only entered the hiking-boot market when the fitness-shoe market, their traditional stomping ground, became saturated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while manufacturers like Merrell, with only $11 million in sales, may doubt the motives of such giants as Reebok, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and K-Mart, hard-core backpackers do not object. &quot;If someone else is going to make a good boot, I don't care if they've been around for 2 years or 25 years,&quot; said Cindy Ross, who has written two books on her experiences hiking. &quot;If it looks good and feels good and has been field tested and reviewed by magazines, I'd use it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ms. Ross, while lightweight boots do not last as long as heavier boots, they are easier to break in and less destructive to the outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the purists admit the giants with their massive advertising budgets are helping to focus attention on the entire market. &quot;We like the advertising because it brings people to the outdoors,&quot; Mr. Gladstone said. &quot;We are not miffed. It's a great opportunity for us.&quot; But he added: &quot;Ten years from now, when the bloom is off the outdoor look, who's going to be left selling the stuff? It'll be the Vasques and the Merrells.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> summer camp for high school basketball players, with its lofty ideals stressing education, has moved after eight years from Princeton, N.J., to Indianapolis. It got a better deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINDY HORR of the Center for Visitors and Conference Seminars at Princeton said: &quot;We liked having them. But they got a fantastic deal in Indianapolis, with business people getting behind them and underwriting the cost.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years the camp, which runs for a week in July, attracted the country's top basketball players who had at least a year of high school remaining. Such players as ALONZO MOURNING of Georgetown and KENNY ANDERSON of Georgia Tech and now the Nets were once </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the players attending were academically troubled. In 1989, more than half the 124 students tested were reading at or below the eighth-grade level. More than a third couldn't read above a fifth-grade level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was a major reason why classes were held in the morning, and motivational speakers, like SPIKE LEE , MUHAMMAD ALI and GEORGE STEINBRENNER , addressed the athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp also attracted college scouts. They were there for the afternoon workouts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE graying of jockdom is apparent all along Madison Avenue. At age 39, Jimmy Connors is urging headache sufferers to &quot;Nupe it with Nuprin&quot; in television commercials and print advertisements created by J. Walter Thompson. Soon, BBDO Worldwide will add the tennis player to the roster of celebrities featured in Diet Pepsi's continuing &quot;You've got the right one baby, uh-huh!&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Connors is one of a teamful of sports stars with wrinkled brows beneath their headbands or receding hairlines under their helmets who are becoming more popular in advertising and as product endorsers. Advertising and sports executives attribute the growing appeal of aging athletes to their popularity with the baby-boom generation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a new print ad by Wieden &amp; Kennedy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> footwear, Nolan Ryan, who is 44 years old, appears alongside an inspirational text that insists: &quot;It's easier to keep going if you never stop. Just do it.&quot; And in another print ad just coming out, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York for Duracell Inc., a photograph of the Texas Rangers pitcher in action appears under the headline &quot;He runs like he's on Duracell.&quot; These ads follow the pitcher's campaigns for Advil pain reliever, by Young &amp; Rubicam New York, and Wrangler jeans, by the Martin Agency Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Foreman, the 42-year-old boxer, co-stars with Bo Jackson in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spot also created by Wieden; when Mr. Jackson walks out of a singing-and-dancing spot-within-the-spot, Mr. Foreman eagerly fills in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez, who is 55, is featured in ads for Toyota, by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Inc., and the Nestle Crunch candy bar, by Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the 76 million consumers born between 1946 and 1964 get older, &quot;they respond to the guys and girls who hang tough and defy the odds,&quot; Scott Bedbury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising director, said in a telephone interview from his office in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;The Nolan Ryan ad is all about still doing it after all these years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is &quot;kind of a wonderful confluency of celebrities and audience identification with them,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, director of the Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Connors was a natural for Nuprin, said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York, because the baby boomers &quot;are the people beginning to get the muscle aches.&quot; Thompson signed the tennis star before his surprising success at the United States Open, Mr. Patterson added, but rushed to create additional ads to capitalize on his march to the semifinals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reason older athletes are becoming so visible is that they have known track records, meaning there are likely to be fewer surprises for advertisers and agencies. By contrast, a younger star-in-the-making still adjusting to the glare of the limelight can be caught, Mr. Patterson said, &quot;in a peccadillo on the front page,&quot; jeopardizing his or her value as an endorser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all their rising popularity, aging athletes have a lap or two to go before threatening the advertising livelihoods of the most successful limber-limbed, fuzzy-cheeked younger athletes. Michael Jordan makes an estimated $15 million to $20 million a year through more than a dozen deals with marketers including Quaker Oats (Gatorade), General Mills (Wheaties), General Motors (Chevrolet) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Magic Johnson earns about $12 million a year from advertisers including Pepsi-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nestle Crunch, which signed him yesterday to be its principal pitchman, starting in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a danger that older athletes will diminish their worth to advertisers by risking what Ms. Lanktree called the &quot;humiliation and embarrassment&quot; of playing past their primes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the phenomenon can continue to build, executives say, as athletes extend their playing careers by taking better care of themselves. One who could be in for big ad paydays nationally, Ms. Lanktree said, is Carlton Fisk, the 43-year-old catcher for the Chicago White Sox.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anyone fill Michael Jordan's sneakers? Maybe not in playing basketball or selling shoes, but the up-and-coming David Robinson might get the chance to see if he can do as well in pitching soft drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising and marketing industries have been abuzz for the last month with talk that Mr. Jordan will soon halt his two years of endorsements for the Coca-Cola Company for a more lucrative, longer-term deal to swallow Gatorade for the Quaker Oats Company. Until now, no one has suggested whom Coca-Cola might sign to replace the Chicago Bulls superstar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr. Jordan leaves Coca-Cola next month, as expected, industry executives said Coca-Cola and its advertising agency, McCann-Erickson New York, might sign Mr. Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robinson's appeal to Coca-Cola, the executives said, centers on the genial, yet hip, image he has earned since he began playing in the National Basketball Assocation two years ago. Just as Mr. Jordan has been the basketball star of the 1980's, the executives said, Mr. Robinson could well be the basketball star of the 1990's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helping Mr. Robinson mightily in conveying his pleasing personality are his television commercials for the Force line of athletic footwear made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. That campaign, created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., presents the athlete as the sole resident of &quot;Mr. Robinson's neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Robinson signs with Coca-Cola, the executives said, his job would be similar to Mr. Jordan's for Coke Classic. He would play a small role in the overall &quot;Can't beat the real thing&quot; campaign for the country's best-selling soft drink. He would probably appear in two or three television commercials a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just for doing that, Mr. Jordan's year-to-year contract with Coca-Cola reportedly paid him about $2.5 million a year. By contrast, the agreement advertising people said Mr. Jordan had reached with Quaker calls for him to become the focus of Gatorade advertising created by Bayer Bess Vanderwarker, Chicago. Industry publications like Advertising Age and Adweek have reported that Mr. Jordan is about to sign a 10-year contract with Quaker worth $18 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry executives described Mr. Jordan as being attracted to Quaker primarily because it offered him a long-term deal for Gatorade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jordan's contract with Coca-Cola expires on July 31. The company plans to use its current spot starring Mr. Jordan until that date. In the spot, Mr. Jordan seems to defy gravity to reach a bottle of Coca-Cola Classic floating in space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola does not comment about potential endorsers it may be considering, said Bob Bertini, a company spokesman. &quot;There is always a lot of speculation about whom we may or may not sign,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising Age reported that Mr. Jordan had already shot television and magazine ads for Gatorade, which might run in late summer. Quaker is expected to announce its deal with Mr. Jordan at a news conference in Chicago early next month, the executives said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola would probably pay Mr. Robinson about the same as Mr. Jordan and also make the contract a short-term one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robinson's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials have been widely praised for their humor. One shows him at home, celebrating his birthday and receiving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes from several basketball-playing friends. But David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, sends him an autographed photo -- of Mr. Stern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another spot, however, came in for criticism. In it, Mr. Robinson, speaking in the style of Fred Rogers of public television's &quot;Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood,&quot; asked at one point, &quot;Can you say, 'Kick some butt?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally, one of Mr. Robinson's friends in the birthday commercial is Mr. Jordan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which produces an Air Jordan line of shoes, is among more than a dozen companies that have signed Mr. Jordan to endorsement contracts with a total estimated annual value of $11 million to $15 million. Others include General Mills, for Wheaties cereal; Sara Lee, for Hanes clothing, and McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robinson would join a number of other athletes in the Coca-Cola advertising lineup, including Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. Coke's Minute Maid Orange Soda commercials spotlight a basketball trio: Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks, Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons and Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The manufacturer terminated the distributor's agreement to sell the manufacturer's products and the distributor's associate sales representatives (ASRs) resigned. The manufacturer contacted the ASRs regarding employment, but they were bound by noncompetition clauses in the distributor's employment contracts. The ASRs negotiated releases from their restrictive covenants and accepted employment with the manufacturer. The distributor filed an action against the manufacturer, claiming tortious interference with contract and conspiracy. The court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer, finding that it did not interfere and induce breach of contract because it hired the ASRs only after they obtained releases. While the ASRs could not accept employment before the releases, they were not barred from receiving calls regarding possible employment. The court found that the manufacturer induced the ASRs to obtain releases from the restrictive covenants so that they could accept new employment, and that this activity was not prohibited. The court held that, because the manufacturer committed no tortious act, the manufacturer did not conspire to commit a tortious act.</SPAN></P>

Between 1976 and 1981 plaintiff and defendant entered into several sales representative agreements. In 1981 plaintiff entered into a Sales Representative Agreement with defendant whereby plaintiff was granted the right to market and sell defendant's products in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Southern Illinois.  The Sales Representative Agreement was terminable by either party with thirty days notice.<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988 plaintiff employed several members of the Davis family and four associate sales representatives (&quot;ASRs&quot;): Robert Logan, Thomas Logan, Rich Bulkley, and Mark Panu. Each ASR executed a contract &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*418]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with plaintiff that included a restrictive covenant prohibiting the ASRs from competing with plaintiff for a period of eighteen months after the termination of the contract with plaintiff. Each restrictive covenant stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a period of eighteen (18) months from &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the date of <BR><BR></SPAN></P>

In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Employer for breach of this provision, the Employer shall be entitled to enforcement by court injunction. Any or all provisions of this paragraph may be waived by written consent of Employer. The purpose and intent of this entire provision is to protect Employer from sudden disruption of its principal source of income.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 31, 1988 defendant gave plaintiff notice that their contractual relationship would terminate on April 30, 1988. On April 1, 1988 plaintiff telephoned the four ASRs and informed them that his contract with defendant had been terminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff asserts that on March 31, 1988 plaintiff received a call from Julie Dempster, a management level &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employee of defendant. During this call Ms. Dempster told plaintiff that she had heard of plaintiff's termination from Thomas Logan, one of plaintiff's ASRs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">2&nbsp;Plaintiff offers the call from Ms. Dempster as evidence of a conspiracy between defendant and the ASRs to breach the restrictive covenants in the ASRs' contracts. There is a dispute between the parties concerning the date on which the Julie Dempster call occurred. Plaintiff insists that the Dempster call occurred on March 31, 1988, one day before plaintiff informed Thomas Logan of the termination. Defendant, however, asserts that the Dempster call occurred after plaintiff notified the ASRs of the termination. If plaintiff received the Dempster call before plaintiff called Thomas Logan with news of the termination, why did plaintiff routinely call and notify Thomas Logan of the termination as if Logan were ignorant of the fact? If plaintiff had received the Dempster call before plaintiff notified Logan, plaintiff would have immediately questioned Logan as to how Logan learned of the termination either before or simultaneously with plaintiff. There is no suggestion that an inquisition of this sort occurred between plaintiff and Thomas Logan on April 1, 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On April 4, 1988 Robert Logan, an ASR, contacted plaintiff and informed him that the ASRs wanted to meet with plaintiff on April 8, 1988 in Columbia, Missouri. At the April 8, 1988 meeting the ASRs were asked to choose whether they wanted to resign or remain in the employ of plaintiff and attempt to rebuild plaintiff's business with other product lines. The sale of defendant's products had been the primary source of the ASRs' income. The ASRs elected to resign, and indicated they would be amenable to any job offer forthcoming from defendant. At the time of the April 8, 1988 meeting the ASRs had earned a total of $ 177,000.00 in unpaid commissions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">3&nbsp;There is a dispute concerning whether the resignation of the ASRs resulted in a forfeiture of those commissions. Although the contracts signed by ASRs do not mandate a forfeiture of unpaid commissions upon termination of the contract, some of the ASRs testified in their depositions that they believed their resignation triggered a forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 16, 1988 plaintiff &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  met with defendant to discuss the terms of the termination between plaintiff and defendant. At that meeting plaintiff discussed with Scott Carey, defendant's National Sales Manager, defendant's employment of the ASRs. Plaintiff offered to release the ASRs from the restrictive covenants and allow them to work for defendant if defendant paid plaintiff $ 1,250,000.00. Defendant rejected plaintiff's offer. On April 16, 1988 plaintiff authorized defendant to talk with the ASRs about employment with defendant but not to extend offers of employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After April 16, 1988 defendant contacted the four ASRs and discussed employment opportunities with them. Plaintiff asserts that defendant actually made offers of employment &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*419]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the ASRs. Defendant, however, asserts that its contacts with the ASRs were more tentative.  Defendant asserts that it repeatedly warned the ASRs that the possibility of employment with defendant was conditioned upon the ASRs being released from the restrictive covenants in their contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, the ASR's hired an attorney to obtain their release from the restrictive covenants in their contracts with plaintiff. On May 11, 1988 the ASRs obtained a release in a document &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  signed by plaintiff and the four ASRs entitled &quot;Mutual Release.&quot; Under the terms of the Mutual Release, the ASRs released all claims to their unpaid commissions from plaintiff. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff, in turn, released the ASRs &quot;from the operation or enforcement of a restrictive covenant not to compete with the business of [plaintiff].&quot; Pursuant to the Mutual Release, plaintiff agreed that the ASRs could &quot;undertake sales relationships with [defendant] or any other person, firm or corporation, without objection, interference or action of any kind by [defendant].&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">4&nbsp;Plaintiff asserts that the ASRs' April 8, 1988 resignation triggered the forfeiture of all unpaid commissions due the ASRs. It seems unlikely that in April, 1988 plaintiff would value the release of the mutual covenants at $ 1,250,000 and then one month later release the mutual covenants for nothing. It is more plausible that the ASRs possessed a substantial claim for unpaid commissions and this claim served as consideration for the release of the restrictive covenants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the execution of the mutual release, the ASRs each accepted employment with defendant. All of the ASRs are currently employed by defendant.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Tortious Interference</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Count I plaintiff alleges that defendant tortiously interfered with the contractual relations between plaintiff and the ASRs.  [HN4] Under Missouri law, plaintiff must establish five elements to sustain a cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(1) a contract or valid business relationship or expectancy;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(2) knowledge by defendant of the contract or relationship;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(3) intentional interference by defendant which induces breach of contract or relationship;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(4) absence of justification; and(5) resulting damages.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Fleming v. Mercantile Bank and Trust Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 766 S.W.2d 666, 668 (Mo. App. 1989) (citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Francisco v. Kansas City Star Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 629 S.W.2d 524, 529 (Mo. App. 1981)). Plaintiff has satisfied the first two elements. First, plaintiff executed contracts with each of the four ASRs. Each contract included a restrictive covenant that prohibited the ASRs from accepting a position with defendant while the restrictive covenant was in force.  Second, defendant was aware that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ASRs executed contracts with plaintiff that contained restrictive covenants. Plaintiff, however, has failed to satisfy the third element.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Interference Inducing Breach</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN5] In order to prosecute an action for tortious interference defendant must have intentionally interfered and induced a breach of the contract. The ASRs would have breached the contracts if they accepted employment and commenced working for defendant when the restrictive covenants were in force. On May 11, 1988 the ASRs secured a release from the restrictive covenants which specifically authorized the ASRs to accept employment with defendant. No breach of their contracts with plaintiff occurred when the ASRs accepted employment with defendant after May 11, 1988. The alleged contacts by defendant did not induce the ASRs to breach the contract.  Instead, defendant's contacts induced the ASRs to obtain a release from the restrictive covenants so that they could accept employment with defendant without breaching their contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges that the ASRs breached the contract in April, 1988 when defendant contacted the ASRs concerning offers of employment. In order to determine whether the ASRs' contacts with defendant &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constituted a breach of the contracts, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*420]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court must examine the terms of the restrictive covenant. Because restrictive covenants restrain commerce and limit the employee's freedom to pursue his trade, enforcement of such agreements is carefully restricted.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Osage Glass, Inc. v. Donovan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 693 S.W.2d 71, 73 (Mo. banc 1985).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictive covenants in the ASRs' contracts provide, in relevant part: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">the employee shall not . . . directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or be connected in any manner with any business of the type and character of business engaged in by the Employer at the time of such termination.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the restrictive covenants prevent the ASRs from engaging in numerous activities with a competitor, including accepting an offer, the terms of the restrictive covenants do not prohibit the ASRs from receiving calls from a competitor regarding possible employment, indicating receptiveness to an offer, or negotiating the terms of the offer. If the Court was to liberally construe the terms of the restrictive covenant, it could find that negotiations aimed toward &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  joining a competitor were a breach of the restrictive covenants. Because the Court must restrictively construe the terms of the restrictive covenant, the Court concludes that the activity engaged in by the ASRs was not expressly prohibited, and no breach occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foregoing reasons, the Court enters summary judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff on the merits of Count I and Count II, in which plaintiff seeks punitive damages on Count I.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Conspiracy</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Count III plaintiff alleges that defendant conspired with the ASRs and induced them to breach their contractual relationship with plaintiff. As was discussed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, no breach of the contractual relationship between plaintiff and the ASRs occurred. Defendant, therefore, is not liable for tortious interference.  [HN6] Under Missouri law there can be no conspiracy to commit a tort unless the tort itself was committed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Stegeman v. First Missouri Bank</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 722 S.W.2d 349, 354 (Mo. App. 1987). Some wrongful act must have been done by one or more of the alleged conspirators and the fact of a conspiracy merely bears on the liability of the various defendants as tortfeasors.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Farmland Industries v. Frazier-Parrott Commodities, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19"> Inc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 871 F.2d 1402, 1409 (8th Cir. 1989) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Bockover v. Stemmerman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 708 S.W.2d 179, 182 (Mo. App. 1986)). Because defendant committed no tortious act, defendant is not liable for a conspiracy to commit a tortious act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foregoing reasons, the Court enters summary judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff on the merits of Count III and Count IV, in which plaintiff seeks punitive damages on Count III. </SPAN></P>

The New Jersey Superior Court held that if the employer's policy invaded the plaintiff's privacy, then the discharge would be in violation of public policy as embodied in the common law tort of invasion of privacy. ... If the state does not have a constitutional provision such as California's, or if its courts do not regard a violation of an independent tort as against public policy, employees will find it difficult to establish that their discharge because of an adventure program violated public policy. ...  Requiring employees to participate in these programs should create liability for employers and program operators under tort doctrines such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and possibly wrongful discharge. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article will examine the operation of various outdoor programs, the psychological harms they may cause,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the means for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*659]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  redressing injuries when they occur.

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. OUTDOOR TRAINING PROGRAMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although wilderness training programs such as Outward Bound have been in existence for many years, their widespread use in the corporate setting began in the 1980's, when American companies faced fierce competition from abroad and major upheavals at home resulting from deregulation, mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and forced downsizing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These programs are, in part, an effort by corporations to recreate the cohesiveness and camaraderie of more affluent times.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This section will analyze and critique the basic &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*660]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  theory for the use of adventure programs in the corporate setting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c19">A. The Theory of Experiential Learning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experiential education is said to teach self-esteem, teamwork and risk-taking by removing individuals from their normal environment and challenging them to accomplish outdoor physical tasks such as rope climbing, white water canoeing, or other survival activities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emphasis is on learning by doing rather than by lectures or classroom discussions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These physical activities are intended as &quot;metaphors&quot; for other areas of the participant's life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the participant is able to ford a rushing stream, climb a steep cliff, or paddle through rough white water, then he or she should have the confidence to meet challenges in other areas of life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exercises are also designed to foster teamwork.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By facing physical challenges together, a group of diverse individuals with little in common should be &quot;bound together&quot; by this experience.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These same principles are thought to apply to corporate adventure programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The corporation sends managers and executives to a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*661]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rural or wilderness setting for a course that usually lasts three or four days.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During that time, the employees participate in a series of team-building and risk-taking exercises.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;trust fall&quot; and the &quot;spider's web&quot; are examples of the former.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the trust fall, one participant stands on a tree stump with his or her back to other group members who line up and hold out their arms.  The participant is then told to fall back, and is caught by the others before he or she hits the ground.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spider's web requires participants to pass through a series of ropes strung between two trees in a pattern resembling a web.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The web consists of a series of holes each of which the group may use only once.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group is asked to pretend that the ropes are electrified and should not be touched.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To complete the exercise successfully, participants must lift and carefully pass each &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*662]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  person through most of the holes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the process of planning and executing this task, group members are supposed to listen and work together as a team.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this and the other team exercises, the assumption is that members of the group will apply these lessons to the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One responsibility of the group leader or facilitator, who works for the adventure program, is to make the connections between the exercises and the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical exercises used to encourage risk-taking are designed to appear difficult and to induce fear in the average participant, even when undertaken with appropriate safety equipment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants might be required to climb up a steep rock, to walk across a six inch beam twenty feet off the ground,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or to climb down a steep cliff.  The objective is to require participants to face their fears and take a chance with the encouragement of other group members.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The physical exercises are said to give participants new confidence in their ability to take risks on the job and accomplish tasks that they believed were beyond their capabilities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one course, risk-taking is taught by having the participants climb thirty-five feet up a &quot;pamper pole&quot; and onto a small platform.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are then urged to leap off the platform and catch hold of a trapeze swing some seven feet away.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few are able to do so successfully.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, participants are told to jump off the platform.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although ropes attached to a hip and shoulder harness prevent participants from falling, these safety measures are not desinged to reduce, and, in fact, do not reduce, the anxiety.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*663]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">B. Critique of Corporate Adventure Programs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever virtues adventure programs may have when used in other settings, their use in the corporate setting is troublesome.  Many jobs create some degree of stress and anxiety.  But the stress and anxiety created by wilderness programs appear to bear little relationship to that which occurs in most workplaces.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor is there much evidence that the learning that occurs during the adventure program experience is transferred to the workplace in ways that might justify the dangers these programs present.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the evidence is testimonial, gathered by the programs themselves, and presented in hyperbolic form in promotional literature.  For example, promotional literature for SportMind proclaims that AT&amp;T's participation in SportsMind enhanced overall sales from 91% to over 160% of the goal, and that AT&amp;T customer services improved to first in the country.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few other programs claim such far-reaching results,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and most are content to rely on general assertions concerning the positive effect of their version of outdoor adventure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While program brochures are likely to inflate results, it is more &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*664]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disconcerting that much of the management and educational literature has not been more incisive.  Educational specialists, particularly those enamored with experiential education, tend to be uncritical of the use of these programs in the corporate setting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The few serious studies on corporate adventure programs do not demonstrate that they create any lasting impact on productivity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two studies are illustrative.  One doctoral study focused on the short-term psychological effects on participants in the Colorado Outward Bound Program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants filled out questionnaires before, during and after the adventure program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the author reports that participants claimed to experience an increase in self-perception and self-confidence, this improvement faded shortly after completion of the program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The researcher did not study the effects of the program on productivity and efficiency,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and found little effect on teamwork.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another study of managers from an aerospace company who completed a four-day wilderness training program, researchers reported &quot;a boost in morale&quot; and a higher retention rate for those who went through the program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, much of the evidence for this assertion was subjective, relying primarily on the perceptions of participants.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, the researchers were unable to document any increase in the company's &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*665]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overall performance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if adventure programs were shown to improve corporate performance, other concerns counsel caution.  The risk exercises, for example, deliberately induce anxiety in the participants.  Reluctant or fearful participants run the added humiliation of failing in front of their colleagues.  For example, one bank executive screamed and yelled during an exercise when he and eight others &quot;were required to cross a river in one trip, using a canoe and an inner-tube.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It later turned out that he was afraid of the water but could not admit it because of peer pressure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubts about the propriety of trading on the emotional losses of employees for the financial gain of the corporation increase when the voluntariness of corporate adventure programs is considered.  Some programs insist that they will train only employees who volunteer, and that they discourage employers from requiring employees to participate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, few employees would feel free to refuse to participate, aware that if they do not go they might jeopardize their futures with the company.  As one Federal Express regional director stated: &quot;There was nothing voluntary about coming here.  When your boss says he's organized a trip and would you like to come, then you go and pack your bags.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of choice makes the risk-taking exercises of wilderness programs far more problematic in the corporate setting than elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not frightening, the team-building exercises have other problems; in particular, the exercises require employees to interact &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*666]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with each other on a more intimate level than they might otherwise choose to on their own.  For example, team exercises often require participants to engage in an extensive amount of touching and other physical contact, behavior usually reserved for intimate relationships.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offensiveness of unwanted intimacies may be increased when the program includes both male and female participants.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As discussed later, the &quot;forced intimacy&quot; of adventure programs might constitute an unjustified invasion of participants' privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional concern about these programs is their assumption that lack of group cohesion and reluctance to take risks are owing to flaws or failures of individual employees rather than to the inadequacies of the corporate environment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the &quot;quick fix&quot; of an adventure program, the corporation's employees return to the same work environment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, many of the problems attributed to employees are not of their own making but are the products of the rapid and dramatic changes of the last decade.  Corporate employees, including middle managers and executives, have far less job security than in the past.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lack of security -- the feeling that everyone's job is on &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*667]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the line and all are competing for jobs -- undoubtedly affects group cohesion and the willingness of managers to trust each other.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adventure programs assume that managers need to be taught mutual trust and teamwork.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, insecurity and lack of trust may be perfectly rational responses to a troubled work environment.  What employees need is not a short, stress-filled wilderness program but a corporate environment that allows them to work with each other without undermining their own positions in the company.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, corporations legitimately need to encourage managers to take risks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But often, managers find that making risky business decisions, especially those that do not produce short-term results, jeopardizes their tenure with the company.  The Japanese experience indicates that greater group cohesion and a long-term view come from creating a supportive environment over a long period of time, not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*668]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from facing risks in an artificial setting for a few days.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some corporate adventure programs also introduce arbitrary or irrevelant factors into the process of evaluating employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although directors of adventure programs disapprove of the practice, they readily admit that there is no way they can prevent the company from evaluating employees based on their performance in the program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, employees are not only subjected to unusual &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*669]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  physical and psychological challenges, they may also find that their futures with the company have been injured by their performance on activities unrelated to their jobs.  Employees have a right to expect that their job performance, not outdoor programs, will determine their prospects for retention and advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another objection to corporate adventure programs stems from their adoption of a quasi-military, and therefore predominantly male, model of individual and social organization that devalues and excludes other approaches.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, SportsMind practices a war game called &quot;Samurai&quot; in which participants are organized into two teams that battle each other according to the code of the Samurai.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each team is told to develop their own &quot;corporate cultures&quot; with simple uniforms, chants and other rituals.  Team members are required to protect their leader to the death if necessary.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More generally, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*670]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adventure programs create group cohesion by subjecting participants to physical and psychological stresses in the belief that participants later will be bound to each other by having &quot;survived&quot; such experiences.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This approach places a high premium on physical activities and risks, and devalues discussion -- as if little is learned until participants are given a tangible physical demonstration of the principles of trust and the need for group cohesion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the theory behind adventure programs betrays not only their military roots but also their use with young people in the schools.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants are presumed to be unable to understand basic principles of social organization without concrete demonstrations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever value experiential outdoor education may have with children, using these programs with adults, particularly in the compulsory setting of a corporation, presents serious issues of abuse that the legal system will soon be called upon to confront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do the programs infantilize participants, but their emphasis on physical prowess, and deemphasis on other socializing skills, disadvantages women.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If called on to increase teamwork and trust, women, who tend to be more comfortable expressing emotions, might bring all employees involved together and discuss the obstacles to teamwork and trust that exist.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adventure programs assume that the only way to generate effective discussions is to require participants to perform physical tasks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, they deemphasize the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*671]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  very social skills at which many women excel.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Performance of male-dominated tasks, such as those called for by outdoor programs, may disadvantage female managers if this performance is used to evaluate whether the employee is &quot;company material.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. TORT AND CONTRACT CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYERS AND OPERATORS OF ADVENTURE PROGRAMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees might sue their employers and operators of adventure training programs in the event of injury suffered during the adventure program or in the event of discharge for refusal to take part in a course.  The principal causes of action are intentional infliction of emotional distress,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invasion of privacy  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wrongful discharge.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corporate training programs are a new area for legal liability; as yet, there are no reported cases defining the liability of either employers or program operators.  However, given the risks associated &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*672]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with adventure programs discussed in section I of this article, it is only a matter of time before someone brings a suit.  This section will explore whether existing law is adequate to provide redress for the kind of emotional injuries that stress training can cause.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since one of the major purposes of outdoor training programs is to put employees deliberately into frightening or stressful situations,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intentional infliction of emotional distress is the most obvious tort cause of action available to injured employees.  Although this tort action was not developed for the employment setting, employees have frequently used it to seek redress for emotional distress caused by employer conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have had some success, but only in extreme cases.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This reluctance to find liability is due, in part, to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*673]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amorphous character of the tort, and the concern that a broad interpretation may create a flood of employment cases and undermine the employment-at-will doctrine.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts might also be concerned that employment practices that cause some degree of emotional harm to employees are necessary to the efficient functioning of the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Restatement (Second) of Torts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to show intentional infliction of emotional distress,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the plaintiff must establish: (1) that the defendant engaged in &quot;extreme and outrageous conduct,&quot; (2) which &quot;intentionally or recklessly&quot; (3) caused (4) severe emotional distress.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of these elements, employees may encounter difficulty establishing that adventure training programs constitute extreme and outrageous conduct, and that employers intended to cause, or were reckless with regard to causing, emotional harm.  Even if an injured employee can establish the elements of the tort, the employer may still prevail if it establishes that employees consented to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Extreme or Outrageous Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one writer has indicated, the most important element of this tort is whether the defendant's behavior constitutes extreme or outrageous conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, if the plaintiff can establish this element, courts are prone to find that the elements of causation, intent and severe distress have been satisfied.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts are more likely to find &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*674]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the requisite degree of outrageousness when the defendant has power over the plaintiff derived from a contractual or status relationship -- landlord-tenant, creditor-debtor, or employer-employee -- and the defendant appears to be using this power to inflict emotional harm.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even then, however, the defendant's behavior must be fairly abusive.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a general matter, courts do not question the legitimacy of these relationships no matter how unequal they are,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but rather impose liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress to regulate the relationship and to keep the more powerful party within civilized bounds.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the employment setting, courts accept that the employer will inflict distress on employees in the everday operation of the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A degree of brusqueness or even insensitivity is permissible when necessary to assure performance of essential tasks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*675]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adventure programs, however, often include activities that have little, if any, relationship to the workplace responsibilities of the employee-participants.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, adventure program activities are often designed to be stressful, whereas the stress of the workplace is normally incidental to an activity with immediate purposes other than the creation of stress.  The tenuous connection between adventure programs and legitimate expectations of the workplace, and the deliberate emphasis on stressful activities, may make it easier for employees to establish that employer conduct exceeds acceptable limits.  The caselaw suggests that the farther the conduct or activity is removed from the legitimate requirements of the job, the more likely that a court will find it to be outrageous and extreme.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Rulon-Miller v. IBM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a supervisor fired the plaintiff for having a romantic relationship with a former employee who had left to work for a rival company.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discharge contravened a company policy which protected employees' private lives unless the company could show that the relationship threatened its legitimate business interests.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finding that the employee was penalized &quot;for conduct unrelated to her work,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court concluded that under all the circumstances of the case the employer's behavior was outrageous.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c19">Rulon-Miller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests a number of features that ought to be expected in any determination of outrageous conduct.  First, whether a tortfeasor's action rises to the level of outrageousness depends, in part, on the setting in which the conduct occurs.  In the employment setting, employer practices that intrude into the personal lives of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*676]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employees are more likely to be outrageous than those more directly related to the employee's job responsibilities.  Second, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Rulon-Miller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests that unless the connection to the workplace is self-evident, the employer has some burden of showing that its intrusion is job-related.  The activities of adventure programs can intrude into deeply personal aspects of an employee's life.  They require employees to expose their most elemental and private fears to supervisors and co-workers.  Whether these demands constitute outrageous conduct should depend, in part, on the extent and directness of their relationship to legitimate requirements of the workplace.  As indicated earlier, this connection seems weak; at any rate, it has not been established in any reliable study.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employers resisting an allegation of outrageous conduct should have the burden of establishing that connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the employer offers some proof that the adventure program activities improve managerial, and therefore corporate, performance, adventure activities may nevertheless constitute outrageous conduct.  Courts in Oregon and in other states have held employers liable for outrageous and extreme conduct despite a clear connection to the needs of the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Bodewig v. K-Mart, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an irate customer charged that the plaintiff, a cashier, took money that the customer had left on the counter.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After searching the employee's jacket, in order to placate the customer, the manager had a female assistant manager take the employee into the women's restroom to conduct a strip search of the employee in front of the customer;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no money was found.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plaintiff quit her job the next day.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Oregon court found that, while the manager was legitimately concerned with the possibility of theft, a jury could find that subjecting the employee to a humiliating strip search to placate an irate customer was outrageous conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Hall v. May Dep't Stores Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a supervisor accused the plaintiff of stealing money.  The supervisor did not have convincing evidence of the employee's guilt, but nevertheless threatened &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*677]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her with &quot;prosecution and imprisonment&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in order to frighten her into confessing to the theft.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the interview, the plaintiff was forced to quit her job.  The court recognized that the supervisor may have been pursuing the employer's legitimate interest in detecting employee theft.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It concluded, however, that intentionally subjecting the employee to a hostile confrontation constituted outrageous conduct in light of the &quot;scanty evidence&quot; of the employee's guilt.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c19">Bodewig</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Hall</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> establish that conduct may be outrageous even if it is related to the employer's legitimate concerns; the fact that an employer sees a possible benefit to itself from abuse of an employee does not excuse that abuse.  When an adventure program forces employees to expose and confront their fear of falling  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or drowning  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or suffer public humiliation,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the distress produced seems no less outrageous than that suffered by an employee forced to confess to a crime.  It thus seems likely that the more egregious forms of corporate exercises will result in liability.  But it is not at all clear how far courts will go in imposing limits on the use of stress-inducing methods in pursuit of improved performance and profit.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Intent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injured employees should have little difficulty satisfying the intent requirement because adventure programs deliberately create stressful conditions.  Indeed, it is the overcoming of deliberately induced anxiety or fear that is thought to change the participants' attitudes by forcing them to &quot;face their personal dragons.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employers &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*678]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might argue that while they intend to change attitudes they do not intend to cause severe distress.  However, a showing of intent does not require that the employer intend severe harm; it is enough that the employer intended to &quot;act . . . in a manner that can be considered outrageous.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If courts consider these programs to constitute outrageous conduct, then subjecting employees to the rigors of these programs is enough to show intent.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if the employer argues that it did not intend to cause severe emotional harm, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Restatement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formulation also allows a finding of liability if the defendant is reckless as regards the possibility that the outrageous conduct would cause severe distress.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the risks, these programs are often, at the very least, reckless.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a defense, employers might argue that they do not require employees to participate in these programs and that, therefore, any employee who chooses to participate consents to do so.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although rarely raised in emotional distress cases, consent is a defense to this and all other claims based on the commission of an intentional tort.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consent usually means that the employees are able to make a choice as to whether to participate in the adventure program without jeopardizing their futures with the employer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the coercion implicit in a corporate decision to enroll managers in an adventure &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*680]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  program, and the limited information normally provided to employees about these programs, suggest that consent may not be an effective defense.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most employees are not likely to feel that they can refuse to participate in an adventure program even if given a choice, since doing so may jeopardize their futures with the company.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if refusal does not jeopardize the relationship with supervisors, other employees who went through the program might resent their absence, thereby damaging their relationships with co-workers and impeding their future job performance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many operators of adventure programs are aware of the problem of coercion and of the risks that employees might try exercises that they are unable to accomplish without experiencing serious emotional distress.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, some tell employers not to send unwilling employees to the program, warn employees that they need not try everything, and tell employers not to use performance as part of its evaluation system.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all that these operators can do is to offer these suggestions.  They have no way to ensure that participation is truly voluntary; coercion is inherent in the command structure of a corporation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if employers advise employees that participation in an adventure program is not required, the prospective participants may lack the information necessary to make an informed decision.  There is little indication that participants know much about the exercises in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*681]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  training course.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adventure training literature rarely explains the program in detail, and it is not even clear if participants see this literature because much of it is written for the corporate employer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, the literature cannot convey to participants what these exercises are really like.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the first opportunity for an employee to make an informed decision on participation in the program may be when the employee arrives at the training site.  By this time, however, the pressure for participation has increased substantially and employees may feel unable to refuse to participate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adventure programs are designed to have group members encourage other reluctant participants to become &quot;team players,&quot; and to take the risks.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This pressure might well push participants to engage involuntarily in activities that they cannot manage, with devastating results.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the employee can establish the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress, some states do not allow employees to bring this tort action against the employer; rather, they must bring a claim for psychological injury under workers' compensation schemes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, injured employees can bring a separate action against the operators of the corporate adventure programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workers' compensation would not be a bar to this suit.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How well &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*682]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would such a claim against the operator fare?  Unlike the employer, the operator does not have power over participants.  Employees participate because the employer told or &quot;asked&quot; them to do so.  Even so, there may be no reason to treat the operator differently.  The operators or consultants sell their programs to corporate leaders as ways to transform employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operator and the employer normally design the course together.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operator depends on the employer to deliver the participants.  Although the authority operators have is derived from the employer, this authority is still imbued with the same potential for abuse as with the employer.  Furthermore, the operator normally organizes and conducts the exercises.  If operators of outdoor programs work in the corporate setting, they ought to bear the same risks and liability if a participant is emotionally harmed in the process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*683]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">B. Invasion of Privacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren and Brandeis are generally credited as the first to advocate a cause of action for invasion of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their landmark article of 1890, they argued that invasion of privacy should be treated as a cause of action independent of trespass and other intentional torts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, Prosser and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Restatement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> divided invasion of privacy into four distinct causes of action: (1) &quot;unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of&quot; individuals or their private affairs;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) appropriation of the name or likeness of another;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) public disclosure of private facts which &quot;would be highly offensive to a reasonable person;&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and (4) publicity that unreasonably places an individual &quot;in a false light before the public.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because adventure programs may intrude into aspects of employees' lives unrelated to the requirements of the job, intrusion upon seclusion is the privacy cause of action most relevant to corporate adventure programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">=P684 1. Intrusion Upon Seclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Restatement (Second) of Torts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defines intrusion upon seclusion as follows: &quot;One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his [or her] private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There can be little doubt that the intrusions of corporate adventure programs are intentional.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Establishing that the intrusions are highly offensive and that they invade a protected form of solitude or privacy concerns may be more problematic.  Although the case law on privacy has not yet addressed corporate adventure programs, the latter provide a unique opportunity to clarify what privacy rights exist in the employment setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the phrase, &quot;the right to be let alone,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*685]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  little agreement about the meaning of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the employment setting, most of the intrusion cases stem from information-gathering and evaluation activities undertaken by the employer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even for these more traditional intrusions, there is disagreement about how much latitude an employer should have in investigating and regulating employee behavior.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one commentator explains, many employers engage in intrusive information-gathering practices in order to know the &quot;whole employee,&quot; what he or she can or does do on and off the job.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the privacy cases, employees have challenged the gathering of information on such matters as their financial affairs, off-duty recreational activities, personal relationships, or sexual activities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In deciding &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*686]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whether these information-gathering activities intrude upon protected private affairs, the courts have focused on whether the employer has delved into matters in which employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding their persons, beliefs, property, personal relationships and other off-work activities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, such expectations may have to yield to the legitimate requirements of the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The determination of whether the intrusion on employees' reasonable expectations of privacy is &quot;offensive&quot; usually turns on the extent to which the intrusive activity is related to the legitimate concerns of the employer and on the means that the employer uses to accomplish these ends.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*687]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The discussion of adventure programs in Section I  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests that such programs may intrude into employees' private affairs or concerns in two ways.  First, corporate adventure programs may force employees to reveal deep-seated fears and anxieties that, in the usual work setting, are the personal and private concern of the employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the programs may force employees into forms of intimacy that are normally associated with private decisionmaking.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are these invasions justified?  The premise of these exercises is that participants will acquire new confidence to confront more conventional challenges by facing and overcoming these otherwise private fears and anxieties.  The revelation of private feelings inherent in these exercises is compounded when employees who are too fearful to attempt the exercises, or who fail while attempting them, experience embarrassment and humiliaton in front of co-workers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there may be some employment situations in which it is unreasonable for employees to expect that their fears and anxieties concerning unusual physical challenges will remain private,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> those would not appear to include the typical management position.  In most work settings, managers do not have to admit to or confront their personal fears about heights, water, boats or the outdoors.  Moreover, forcing employees to expose these fears may cause the kind of embarrassment and trauma that almost anyne would want to keep private.  Other co-workers and the employer might well interpret this behavior as a sign of &quot;weakness&quot; or incompetence.  Attempting to transform the attitudes of employees this way makes these programs more like therapy sessions, an activity that ordinarily falls within a reasonable expectation of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*688]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The employer may well see the program as a way to discover who will &quot;break&quot; under pressure or stress.  But it does so by means that are so broad that courts should find them offensive intrusions.  Fears of falling or drowning have little to do with the job requirements of managers.  An individual who displays diffidence about rappeling down a steep cliff may nevrtheless be an exellent administrator or executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers might maintain that adventure programs increase a manager's ability and willingness to learn in new places and under less than ideal circumstances.  After experiencing the adventure program, it might be argued, managers should be able to handle anything that the corporation needs for them to do in the fast-changing business world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, like the other claims discussed above, this relationship between adventure programs and managerial duties has not been established.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If employers choose to rely on these claims to justify intrusions into employee privacy, they must offer stronger evidence of the connection than the unsubstantiated assertions of program brochures.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absent such evidence, intruding on employees' emotional privacy should be considered &quot;offensive&quot; within the meaning of the tort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second serious privacy concern with corporate adventure programs is that they put employees through risk-taking and teambuilding physical exercises, purportedly to &quot;bond&quot; them more closely together in order to increase corporate loyalty, efficiency and productivity.  This &quot;bonding&quot; process is designed to go well beyond the polite working relationships accomplished in quality work circles or other kinds of workplace teams.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corporate adventure programs &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*689]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seek to create deep bonds of friendship by putting employees into situations designed to foster vulnerability and deep camaraderie, the kind of intimate relationship employees would not necessarily choose to create on their own.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a minimum, this sort of &quot;forced intimacy&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violates the right of employees to choose their own relationships and friendships.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this argument has not been specifically made in the intrusion cases, some decisions provide authority for the proposition that employers cannot force employees into close relationships.  For example, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Phillips v. Smalley Maintenance Services, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Eleventh Circuit found that the employer wrongfully intruded on the solitude of the plaintiff by sexually harassing her continually for several months.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The employer locked the employee in his office, questioned her about her sex life with her husband, and finally dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*690]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her after she refused his sexual advances.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to finding a violation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Eleventh Circuit found that these activities invaded her privacy under state law even though the employer was not successful in getting his way.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mere use of the employer's power to corner and harass her with obscene suggestions and demands was enough for liability.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although adventure programs do not include sexual harassment of this type, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Phillips</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests that an employer cannot force employees into relationships more intimate than a working relationship.  Insisting that employees &quot;bond&quot; during an adventure program, while not as humilating as sexual harassment, can be just as intrusive, and it would not be surprising for a court to find liability based on that behavior.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tort cases do not expressly address the matter, a zone of protected privacy is defined not only by the exclusion of those who would intrude, but also by an individual's right to make decisions without interference.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most employment cases stress limits &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*691]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on employer conduct without mention of employees' affirmative right to make decisions about their private lives.  Discussions about the importance of employee automomy in or outside of the workplace are less common, perhaps because courts are more concerned with limiting or preserving the employer's control over the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet employee autonomy should mean, at a minimum, that employees are able to prevent exposure of their deepest fears and anxieties to their their employers if such fears have no direct relationship to their ability to perform their work.  Similarly, employees should have the right to extend or withhold friendship or other intimate relationships with other employees as they choose.  The common law right to privacy should protect the employee's right to make these decisions without undue interference by the employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Defenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While courts recognize a right to privacy, they also recognize certain defenses that, if interpreted broadly, may defeat a privacy cause of action.  As with intentional infliction, consent is a defense to invasion of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case law tends to interpret consent broadly.  Some cases have found consent when the employer has announced that it was implementing the program as a policy.  If the employee continues to work for the employer, he or she is thereafter deemed to have consented to the policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n195</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts have used this approach to uphold such employment practices as drug or polygraph testing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n196</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, all the employer would need to do to establish consent &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*692]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is to tell prospective or existing employees that it expects all of its managers to undergo adventure training as part of its training and evaluation process.  For all of the reasons given earlier, consent is not a real option for most job applicants or employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n197</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having to choose between taking or continuing in a job and going through an adventure program, and losing a job or a promotion for refusal to do so, is at best a hollow choice.  Many of the privacy cases ignore this reality.  Even if the employer does not say that participation in the program is required, most employees will feel that they cannot refuse.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n198</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consent in this context is a fiction.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n199</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason courts may interpret consent this braodly is because they believe that the employer's practice is necessary to further legitimate &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*693]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  business goals, even if this practice would be unacceptably intrusive in any other setting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n200</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, in the drug testing cases, courts generally find that the employer has a legitimate concern that employees not be intoxicated or imparied on the job.  So long as the manner of conducting a drug test is not more intrusive than is required and so long as the employee is on notice that such a test is required, courts generally find that the employer has not invaded the employee's privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n201</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While concern over intoxication has some connection to an employee's job, adventure training has much less.  In the absence of such a connection, the employer should not be able to defend these programs simply by alleging that adventure programs improve productivity and efficiency.  Employers should have to demonstrate that these programs further legitimate goals.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n202</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kind of anecdotal information found in the literature should not suffice.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n203</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, employers should also have to prove that they could not achieve such goals with less intrusive means.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n204</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of what has been said about the liability of employers under the tort of intrusion should apply as well to operators of adventure programs.  If, as I have urged, these programs invade employees' privacy, operators should share this liability.  In general, proponents of adventure programs show little, if any, sensitivity about the intrusiveness of the exercises that they devise and market.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n205</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because operators &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*694]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do not have the same concern about productivity and efficiency that employers have, courts may be less inclined to protect the operators from invasion of privacy claims especially when operators are unable to demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs that they promote to employers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n206</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c19">C. Wrongful Discharge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees may also have a cause of action if they are discharged or pressured to resign as a result of participating or refusing to participate in an adventure program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n207</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, many jurisdictions have modified the harsh employment-at-will doctrine, which precluded judicial intervention in most employment terminations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n208</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The classic statement of the employment-at-will doctrine &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*695]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allowed the employer to terminate the employee for any or no reason.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n209</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only employees covered by collective bargaining agreements or other contracts for a specific term could demand that they be discharged for &quot;just cause.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n210</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to changing attitudes about the employment relationship and a growing body of statutory law limiting employer discretion, courts began to fashion various common law doctrines to limit discharge in a number of situations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n211</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*696]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As with invasion of privacy, wrongful discharge actually comprises several causes of action sounding in both tort and contract.  These include: (1) discharge in violation of public policy;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n212</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) implied and express contracts;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n213</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and (3) the implied convenant of good faith and fair dealing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n214</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most jurisdictions recognize a public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine, but its scope varies from state to state.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n215</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some jurisdictions interpret public policy narrowly; the discharge must violate or impinge on a statute, constitutional provision or judicially created rule in order to violate public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n216</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other jurisdictions do not restrict public policy so stringently, but are unclear as to the boundaries of the concept.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n217</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, even in jurisdictions that interpret the concept broadly, the employer's conduct must affect more than the employee's interest or concerns for the discharge to violate public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n218</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*697]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The one public policy case most relevant to adventure programs, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Wagenseller v. Scottsdale Memorial Hospital</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n219</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was analyzed in terms of violation of the state's indecency statutes.  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Wagenseller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the plaintiff, a nurse, went on an eight-day camping and rafting trip down the Colorado River with a group consisting largely of hospital co-workers and her immediate supervisor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n220</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the trip, she became uncomfortable with group pressure to engage in public urination, bathing, heavy drinking, and other similar activities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n221</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She refused to participate in these activities and in a group parody of &quot;Moon River,&quot; during which participants exposed themselves to others.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n222</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her supervisor and other members of the group did this skit twice, and each time the plaintiff refused to participate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n223</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of her refusal, she was harassed by her supervisor until she was asked to resign.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n224</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the trip, her job evaluations had been very good.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n225</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thereafter, her supervisor constantly criticized her work.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n226</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When she refused to resign, she was fired.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n227</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Supreme Court held that the discharge would be contrary to public policy if the employee was fired for refusing to participate in activities that would violate Arizona's indecent exposure statute.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n228</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Arizona Supreme Court did not limit the definition of public policy to violation of criminal or other statutes, it had little trouble finding that this discharge could have contravened &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*698]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public policy where a criminal statute was involved.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n229</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although most adventure programs do not violate criminal statutes as in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Wagenseller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they still use the coercion inherent in the employment relationship to pressure employees to engage in exercises that have the same potential to humiliate them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n230</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The supervisor in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Wagenseller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw the public participation in intimate activities as a way of bonding employees with each other.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n231</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also viewed the plaintiff's unwillingness to participate as an indication that she was not a team player and, therefore, not a good employee.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n232</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the employer -- a hospital -- did not organize the rafting trip, it failed to protect the employee from her supervisor when she returned to the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n233</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, nothing she was asked to do on that trip had much relevance to her job as an emergency room nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the absence of a pertinent criminal statute, an employee discharged because of an adventure program could allege that the discharge violated public policy under two circumstances.  First, the program might violate the common law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress and/or invasion of privacy in a manner discussed earlier.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n234</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even jurisdictions that interpret public policy narrowly recognize judicial decisions as a source of public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n235</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, the employee may not be able to make this argument if the employer has not committed an independent tort such as, for example, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*699]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when the employee is fired for refusing to go.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n236</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Slohoda v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n237</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the employee alleged that he was dismissed because he had an extramarital affair with a co-worker.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n238</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Jersey Superior Court held that if the employer's policy invaded the plaintiff's privacy, then the discharge would be in violation of public policy as embodied in the common law tort of invasion of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n239</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the employer fired the employee for reasons and under circumstances that create liability under this tort, then, in addition to liability under the tort of invasion of privacy, the discharge would also be in violation of public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n240</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the employer's conduct creates liability for invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress, why does it matter if the employer is liable for a discharge in violation of public policy? Although the employee may not receive greater damages for a tortious discharge, nonetheless, liability sends an important message to employers in ways that other tort liability may not.  Unlike invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress, this tort is expressly directed at the employer.  Wrongful discharge tells the employer that it cannot discharge employees for this reason even if it has the power to do so ordinarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of, or in addition to, an independent tort, the employee may be able to use state constitutional provisions that extend the right of privacy to private as well as public employees.  Some states have expansive privacy provisions in their state constitutions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n241</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the California Constitution contains such a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*700]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provision.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n242</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although California courts are divided over the extent of this protection, they have interpreted this provision to cover some nongovernmental action.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n243</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Senmore v. Pool</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n244</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the plaintiff was terminated after refusing to take a &quot;pupillary reaction eye test&quot; for drugs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n245</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The California Court of Appeal held that the California Constitution's privacy provision covers private employers' actions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n246</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the court explained, the plaintiff's right to refuse to take a drug test does not simply affect the employee alone.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n247</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>While rights are won and lost by individual actions of people, the assertion of the right establishes it and benefits all Californians in the same way that an assertion of a free speech right benefits all of us . . . .

It is a dispute over the role of drug testing in the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n248</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The court held that a constitutional claim to a right of privacy was sufficient to raise an issue about whether this discharge was in violation of public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n249</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court remanded the case to the trial court to decide if Kerr-McGee's drug-testing program invaded this employee's privacy as protected by the California Constitution.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n250</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Luck v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n251</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> another California Court of Appeal found that the right to privacy, even if protected by the California Constitution, could not provide the basis for a public policy exception to employment-at-will.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n252</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Privacy, the court asserted, is a private, not a public, right.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n253</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*701]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the employer and employees can contractually agree that employees should take drug tests &quot;without violating any public interest,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n254</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an agreement between the plaintiff and defendant would not violate public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n255</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, public policy exists only when &quot;reasonable persons can have little disagreement.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n256</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no consensus on whether drug testing violates state and federal privacy protections.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n257</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n258</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the California Supreme Court also required that public policy be &quot;firmly established at the time of termination.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n259</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time the defendant introduced its drug testing program, no such rulings on drug testing existed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n260</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the court upheld the jury's determination that the employer violated the employee's right of privacy under the California Constitution, the court still refused to find that the employee's termination violated public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n261</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, even if employees establish that a state constitutional provision &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*702]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  covers the action of private employers, courts may not be willing to find that their discharge violates public policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Senmore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows that courts will balance an employee's expectation of privacy with the employer's need to regulate employees' conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n262</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results of such a balancing test regarding adventure programs depend on how much deference courts give to the employer's arguments that such training programs are necessary to its business operations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Senmore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Luck</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggest that the examination of the employer's justification is more stringent under a state constitution than is employed under the tort of invasion of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n263</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, the court examines the intrusiveness of the employment practice and questions its importance to the business.  For the reasons given earlier, adventure programs should not withstand this level of scrutiny.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n264</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These programs have little to do with legitimate concerns over productivity and efficiency, and far less intrusive means exist to further these purposes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n265</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When constitutional provisions are at issue, courts are generally more willing to scrutinize employer action than they would normally be with common law torts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n266</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the state does not have a constitutional provision such as California's, or if its courts do not regard a violation of an independent tort as against public policy, employees will find it difficult to establish that their discharge because of an adventure program violated public policy.  While there is disagreement over the meaning of public policy, all jurisdictions recognizing the public policy exception indicate that it does not extend so far as to protect an employee's interest in job security.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n267</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As indicated earlier, the employer's action must affect the public at large in some appreciable way.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n268</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Although there is no precise line of demarcation dividing matters &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*703]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that are the subject of public policies from matters purely personal, a survey of cases in other States involving retaliatory discharges shows that a matter must strike at the heart of a citizen's social rights, duties, and responsibilities before the tort will be allowed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n269</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this reasoning, refusing a drug test or any other invasive process might not be seen as protecting other employees who might also be faced with a choice between keeping their jobs or acquiescing to the employer's demands.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n270</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why should courts interpret public policy so narrowly?  Some commentators express concern that interpreting public policy too broadly will unduly impinge on the employer's discretion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n271</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This exception to the at-will rule would then swallow the rule.  As other commentators believe, the at-will rule has lost whatever legitimacy or necessity it once had.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n272</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps it is time to scrap a rule that was, after all, judicially created in the first instance.  But in the absence of such a legal transformation, employees injured by adventure programs may find it difficult to establish the public policy exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Implied and Express Contracts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If employers have made written or oral assurances protecting employees' status, the latter may be able to bring a contract action in the event that they are discharged because of an adventure program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n273</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*704]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until recently, employees could not readily prove that their contractual relationships were other than at-will unless they were hired for a definite term or were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n274</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts created a number of obstacles unique to employment contracts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n275</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spurious doctrines such as mutuality of obligation  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n276</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and independent consideration  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n277</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> placed almost insurmountable barriers in the way of employees attempting to establish that the employer promised more employment security.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n278</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts strictly interpreted any oral or written laguange that allegedly provided for a just cause termination.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n279</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, courts have begun to view employment contracts &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*705]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  like ordinary ones.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n280</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employees have successfully challenged their discharges on the basis of employee handbooks, circulars, and even oral statements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n281</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the setting of adventure programs, there are two general types of assurances that may give rise to a cause of action.  First, the employer may make assurances that the employee will not be discharged except for something approximating good or just cause.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n282</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the employer might have made specific assurances that it will respect the employees's privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n283</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the employee can document specific language restricting the employer's ability to discharge, he or she may be able to use that language if fired for refusing to take part in an adventure program or for breaking down on one.  One common source of such language can be found in employee handbooks usually written for dissemination among supervisors and employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n284</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such handbooks are usually designed to give the work force an understanding of the employer's rules, organization, and requirements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n285</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The handbooks often list reasons for discharge and also outline disciplinary procedures in the event of a rule's transgression.  The rules and procedures in these manuals are also designed to persuade employees that they do not need a union for protection.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n286</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Woolley v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n287</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the plaintiff, an engineering section head, alleged that he was fired in violation of contractual provisions in the employee manual that he read during his employment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n288</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plaintiff argued that provisions in the manual &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*706]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meant that he could be fired only for cause and then only after the employer followed procedures outlined in the manual.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n289</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Jersey Supreme Court held that provisions in employee manuals can bind the employer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n290</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employers issue manuals with job security provisions to encourage employers to stay and to discourage them from organizing a union.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n291</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, the court held that the provisions in Hoffmann-La Roche's policy manual were enforcable.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n292</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts should construe employer manuals &quot;in accordance with the reasonable expectations of employees&quot; taking into account the entire context of their dissemination.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n293</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>A policy manual that provides for job security grants an important, fundamental protection for workers . . . .  If such a commitment is indeed made, obviously an employer should be required to honor it.  When such a document, purporting to give job security, is distributed by the employer to a work force, substantial injustice may result if that promise is broken . . . .  [U]nless the language contained in the manual were such that no one could reasonably have thought it was intended to creat legally binding obligations, the termination provisions of the policy manual would have to be regarded as an obligation undertaken by the employee.  It will not do now for the company to say it did not mean the things it said in its manual to be binding.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n294</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Woolley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left employers with a simple method of avoiding liability for statements made in the manual -- simply include a disclaimer that nothing in the manual is to be construed as affecting the at-will status of any employee.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n295</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a subsequent decision suggests that the disclaimer must be clear and conspicuous to be effective, few courts have treated employee manuals and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*707]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  circulars as they do consumer contracts and have refused to enforce disclaimers on the grounds of unconscionability despite the adhesive nature of these provisions and the imbalance of power between employers and employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n296</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from disclaimers, courts also apply liberal rules of contract modification seen earlier in the discussion of consent.  The employer can simply destroy the manual after announcing this to employees or after making substantial modifications.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n297</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under a unilateral contract theory, the employee &quot;accepts&quot; these changes if he or she continues to work for the employer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n298</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*708]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rarely consider that employees have few alternatives.  Of course, employers could put a provision in the manual stating that employees will be expected to go through adventure training as a part of their job responsibilities.  But this is unlikely because the programs are not used for all employees; furthermore, the employer may fear that applicants will be deterred because of the program.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n299</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from employee manuals or other written documents, the employer's right to discharge may be limited by the employer's assurances and other conduct over a period of time.  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Pugh v. See's Candies, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n300</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the plaintiff, a thirty-two year employee, alleged that he had been dismissed because he had protested the union's position at the bargaining table  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n301</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that the union had retaliated by inducing the employer to discharge him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n302</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breach of contract claims were based on numerous oral assurances during his long tenure with the company that he would not be fired as long as he did a &quot;good job.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n303</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his employment at See's Candies he rose from dishwasher to vice-president in charge of production and received no complaints or criticisms of his work.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n304</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, he was unaware of any problem until the day he was terminated.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n305</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The California Supreme Court found that &quot;an implied-in-fact promise for some form of continued employment&quot; may be created by duration of the plaintiff's employment, the promotions and good performance evaluations over his years of service, and the oral assurances given by senior management.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n306</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the totality of the employer-employee &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*709]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relationship may create an implied promise of continued employment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n307</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the recent decision of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n308</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the California supreme Court allowed a similar claim on behalf of an employee who, during six years of employment, received repeated oral assurances of job security together with superior evaluations, bonuses and promotions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n309</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The length of service, though shorter than in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Pugh</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was not dispositive.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n310</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even a short-term employee may have enforceable assurances if the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; indicates that the employer limited its own right to fire the employee.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n311</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming an employee is able to establish that he or she is not an at-will employee, how would good or just cause protect employees from the consequences of adventure training programs? As with most contract terms, just cause is subject to a number of interpretations.  If language defining the term is present, courts first try to define just cause in these terms.  Otherwise, they look to other sources as a guide.  Collective bargaining agreements routinely contain just cause provisions, and labor arbitration literature provides a general understanding of the concept.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n312</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a leading authority:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A 'no' answer to any one or more of the following questions normally signifies that just and proper cause did not exist . . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1. Did the company give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable disciplinary consequences of the employee's conduct? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>2. Was the company's rule or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the company's business, and (b) the performance that the company might properly expect of the employee? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>3. Did the company, before administering discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*710]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4. Was the company's investigation conducted fairly and objectively? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>5. At the investigation did the [manager] obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>6. Has the company applied its rules, orders, and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees? . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>7. Was the degree of discipline administered by the company in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee's proven offense and (b) the service record with the company?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n313</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This definition of just cause incorporates both substantive and procedural protections.  Much of it concerns not just the reasons for discipline or discharge, but the procedures that management must use to investigate, to give notice to, and to punish the errant employee.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n314</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This definition also reflects the blue collar setting of most labor arbitration proceedings.  With managers, courts are generally inclined to give the employer more leeway in terminations because these employees occupy sensitive or confidential positions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n315</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In regard to adventure programs, the central issues are whether such a program is required for the effective and efficient operation of the employer's business and whether it is appropriate to require managerial employees to go through arduous physical and psychological exercises.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n316</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer depends on whether the court will accept the employer's assertion that these programs are essential to the legitimate requirements of the workplace and the employee's job description.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n317</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly the notice requirements of just cause are not met when employers fail to advise employees that this kind of training is part of their job responsibilities or when employers do not even tell &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*711]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employees what to expect if they participate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n318</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the tenuous connection between the exercises and any workplace benefit, as well as the potential psychological harm that could result, courts may find that the employer lacked good or just cause to dismiss an employee who refuses to go or who performs below the employer's expectations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n319</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the extra latitude shown in cases of managerial employees must have its limits.  It would be counterintuitive for a court to uphold the discharge of a manager when the activities might well create liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n320</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If employees are not fortunate enough to have the job security provided by just cause, they may still have contractual protection if the employer has promulgated a policy of protecting employees' privacy, as was the case in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Rulon-Miller v. IBM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n321</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As indicated earlier, Rulon-Miller sued IBM after she was discharged for having a relationship with a former IBM manager who worked for a rival computer company.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n322</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to bringing an emotional distress claim, the plaintiff also sued for wrongful discharge, relying on protections afforded to all IBM employees by the &quot;Watson memo.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n323</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memo, written by IBM's chairperson, stated that an employee's private life was generally not the concern of management and that employees would not be dismissed for behavior outside the workplace unless these actions interfered with their work.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n324</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court found that the memo provided contractual protection for the plaintiff, whose relationship in no way compromised IBM or interfered with her work.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n325</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Watson memo refers to employees' behavior off the job, the gist of the memorandum is that employees' actions that are &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*712]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unrelated to the job should not be the basis of an employment decision, except when this behavior directly affects the employee's job in some demonstrable manner.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n326</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a company's training program is not an off-duty activity, outdoor training programs require employees to participate in exercises that have little to do with the work that employees are hired to do.  Programs force employees to expose aspects of their personalities and psychological make-up that they would ordinarily keep private.  The Watson memo or other equivalent language protects employees' private activities </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> private feeling whenever possible.  Outdoor adventure programs intrude in serious ways on employees' legitimate expectations of privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n327</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the employer pledges to respect their privacy, then it should be held liable for failing to keep that promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with all contractual claims, success depends on language and understandings between the employer and the employee.  While recent cases have loosened the old restrictions on circumventing the at-will doctrine, the more liberal rules of contract formation and modification also make it easier for the employer to modify this contractual relationship with disclaimers and announcements of new policies.  Unless courts begin to use protective doctrines associated with consumer contracts such as unconscionability, employees may not be able to bring contractual claims as employers grow more sophisticated in dealing with the case law.

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing originated as a contract doctrine to protect the expectations of the parties.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n329</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good faith or &quot;honesty in fact&quot; is implied in every contract and requires parties to avoid behavior that is designed to undermine or evade the requirements of the contract.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n330</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Restatement (Second) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*713]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">  of Contracts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> section 205 comment a explains good faith this way:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Good faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party; it excludes a variety of types of conduct characterized as involving &quot;bad faith&quot; because they violate community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness.  The appropriate remedy for a breach of the duty of good faith also varies with the circumstances.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n331</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the amorphous character of good faith and fair dealing, most jurisdictions refuse to recognize good faith and fair dealing as an exception to the at-will doctrine.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n332</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of those jurisdictions that do, most have restricted its application to situations similar to those that trigger it in other kinds of contracts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n333</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, courts apply the doctrine when the employer discharges an employee for the purpose of depriving the employee of commissions, bonuses or pensions that he or she has earned or is about to earn.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n334</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other jurisdictions, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*714]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notably California, have interpreted good faith and fair dealing to be almost the equivalent of just cause, especially when long-term employees are discharged without a legitimate business reason.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n335</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good faith doctrine's potential to provide employees with the equivalent of just cause explains why many jurisdictions have rejected it.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n336</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> California also allowed an employee to recover tort damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n337</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Treating good faith and fair dealing as a tort is important because tort damages allow a far more generous recovery than contract damages; plaintiffs can collect mental distress and punitive damages.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n338</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential of good faith and fair dealing to undermine the at-will doctrine is best illustrated by California cases such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary v. American Airlines, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n339</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an eighteen-year employee alleged that he was discharged for theft without a complete investigation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n340</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The California Court of Appeal found that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required that a long-term employee be discharged only for good cause when the employer provided procedures to adjudicate employee disputes similar to the one concerning the plaintiff.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n341</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The combination of longevity of service and the existence of grievance procedures meant that the employer must demonstrate just cause to sustain this discharge.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n342</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long-term employee expects that an employer will not treat him or her in an arbitrary fashion.  Similarly, an employee also expects the employer to follow the disciplinary procedure that it established in the first instance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n343</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the plaintiff is ultimately able to establish a lack of good cause at trial, then he or she can receive tort damages.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n344</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, subsequent California Court of Appeal decisions split as to how to apply the implied covenant of good faith and fair &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*716]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dealing to employment cases.  One line of cases required facts similar to those of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- only employees with long seniority and with the protection of express policies governing the adjudication of employee disputes  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n345</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could prevail in this cause of action.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n346</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other line of cases did not limit the doctrine to facts like those in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n347</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, employees had to show that they had some expectations grounded in contract and that employers attempted to deprive them of these contractual expectations by asserting &quot;the existence of good cause for discharge . . . without probable cause and in bad faith.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n348</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;[A]n employer acts in bad faith in discharging an employee if and only if [it] does not believe [it] has a legal right to discharge the employee.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n349</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the employer may have had to show good cause for the discharge and pay tort damages under a wider variety of circumstances than under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cleary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this argument over the applicability of the doctrine became irrelevant after the California Supreme Court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n350</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, plaintiffs will not be able to recover tort damages under this theory at all.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n351</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioned the basic rationale used in all of the earlier good faith and fair dealing cases, denying that the employment relationship is similar to insurance contracts, the context in which the doctrine originally developed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n352</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Foley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> limits good faith and fair dealing to enforcement of implied or express contract assurances of job security  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n353</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and also limits the remedy for a breach of these assurances to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*717]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contract damages regardless of the motivation for the breach.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n354</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees discharged as a result of adventure programs are in a far stronger position when they establish that the employer can dismiss them only for good cause.  As discussed previously, adventure programs should not withstand the careful scrutiny that good cause requires.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n355</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the few jurisdictions that recognize the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing follow California's lead, good faith will be important only if the employee can establish that he or she has the protection of oral or written assurances discussed in the last section.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n356</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even so, tort damages would be unavailable.  Of course, if employees have the protection of handbooks or other assurances of job security, it is difficult to perceive what good faith and fair dealing adds to their protection.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n357</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possibility of tort damages makes this cause of action attractive.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n358</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. ABUSIVE CORPORATE ADVENTURE PROGRAMS: THE NEED FOR A STATUTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, as management expert Peter Drucker has said, corporations will stop sending employees on adventure programs when juries award multimillion dollar verdicts to injured employees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n359</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As indicated in the preceding section, there is the potential for such a verdict, but no guarantee under existing law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n360</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most likely tort cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, is too ill-defined to provide much guidance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n361</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adventure programs may invade an employee's privacy, but courts allow employers to avoid liability by merely announcing ahead of time that employees will be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*718]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expected to participate.  If the employee continues to work, then he or she will be deemed to have consented to this invasion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n362</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Success under any of the wrongful discharge causes of action depends on circumstances that may not be present in all cases.  Obviously, the employee must have been discharged or pressured to resign.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n363</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To prevail on the tort theory of discharge against public policy, employees must have either established the commission of an independent tort or be fortunate enough to reside in a state whose constitution protects private employees' privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n364</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the employer has issued assurances protecting privacy or providing for discharge only in the event of just cause, then employees may prevail on contract theories.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n365</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contract causes of action, however, limit damages to economic loss -- wages, salary, or benefits.  Injured employees cannot recover for mental distress and, in most cases, they cannot recover punitive damages.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n366</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, even contract recoveries may be unavailable if employers publish disclaimers denying any contractual protection.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n367</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the limitations of existing tort and contract causes of action, statutory protection may produce more just and consistent results in discouraging the use of corporate adventure programs.  Numerous states have passed labor statutes regulating questionable employment practices in recent years.  For example, many have enacted laws restricting drug and polygraph testing partly because existing law was inadequate to protect employees' privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n368</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Congress has &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*719]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  passed a comprehensive law regulating the use of polygraphs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n369</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passing a statute that bans the use of corporate adventure programs would be consistent with the recent legislative concern over protecting privacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n370</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*720]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to consistency, a properly drafted statute could prevent the uncertainty of case-by-case determinations.  The legislature can hold hearings and determine the desirability of such programs.  Once a statute bans such programs, injured employees would not have to establish that the programs are intrusive and damaging in every lawsuit.  At the same time, judges would not have to decide if they are interfering with legitimate management decisions.  The legislature will have made that determination for them; the employee would simply have to establish that the employer has violated the statute.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n371</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statute that bans these programs can also make it easier for the employer to know whether it can use particular programs or types of adventure training.  At present, employers can only speculate as to what might happen if employees are psychologically injured as a result of participating in the programs; a statute can eliminate this uncertainty.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n372</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, if Congress passes a statute, then employers and employees will not confront the problem of inconsistent statutes or case law from one state to the next.  Many large corporations have work sites and employees in a number of states; a federal statute could eliminate potential inconsistencies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n373</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*721]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assuming that a statute banning adventure programs is desirable, what should it provide and how can it define adventure programs with enough specificity to avoid including outdoor activities that do not present the same kind of threat to employees, such as ordinary retreats?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n374</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best definition would cover different kinds of adventure training programs.  The statute should prohibit the use of training programs that place employees in severe &quot;physically and/or mentally demanding&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n375</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exercises designed to increase trust, teamwork and risk-taking.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n376</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This definition includes not only the &quot;outward bound&quot; activities discussed throughout this article but also some of the mental exercises associated with the new-age training programs in vogue with a few employers in recent years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n377</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective would be to ban the use of such programs except where the job requires it, as for example in police work of fire fighting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n378</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*722]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  advantage of banning, rather than simply regulating, is simplicity; employers are told that, with few exceptions, they cannot require employees to go through such programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n379</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event that the employer does require or &quot;strongly suggests&quot; that employees participate in adventure programs, the statute should provide a private cause of action that allows injured employees to recover damages covering economic loss, mental distress, punitive damages and attorney's fees.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n380</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Generous damage awards are far more likely to deter employers than allowing recovery only for lost wages or salaries.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n381</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, employees would have less difficulty &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*723]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding lawyers to handle their claims.  In addition to a private cause of action, the statute should also allow the attorney general or some other executive agency to bring suit against employers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n382</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government action may be able to stop employers from using these programs in situations in which employees may not be able to bring suits on their own.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n383</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, if the experience of other labor law statutes is a guide, private parties are far more likely to bring law-suits even when the government has the option to sue.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n384</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal law would have a number of advantages over state laws.  First, the federal government has greater resources to enforce a law dealing with corporate adventure programs.  The Labor Department has administrative structures in place to enforce this and other labor statutes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n385</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, as was mentioned, a federal statute provides uniformity; an employer does not have to worry about different regulations in different states.  Employees will not have to worry that employers will send them to states where adventure programs are permitted, as could easily occur with these kinds of programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n386</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*724]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, a federal statute makes a strong symbolic statementys that protecting employee privacy and peace of mind is a national priority.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>n387</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Congress declines to act in this area, states should take the initiative.  While the impact of state regulation is not as great, Congress may feel some pressure to pass such a bill if a number of states take the lead.  Even employers may then prefer to have a single statute covering all the states.  Inconsistent state laws may create an impetus to pass a federal statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations are using outdoor adventure programs in an affort to create trusting, loyal and innovative employees in a short time without making the kind of structural changes that would promote and nurture such qualities in the workplace.  This kind of quick fix, a short term approach to complex structural problems, is not only ineffective, but also harmful to the dignity and mental health of affected employees.  In the process of remaking employees, adventure programs intrude on the most basic human fears and emotions, all in the name of efficiency and profit.  Requiring employees to participate in these programs should create liability for employers and program operators under tort doctrines such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and possibly wrongful discharge.  If employers have given oral or written assurances of job security, employees may also recover for breach of contract.  However, only a statute banning the use of adventure programs in the corporate setting will adequately protect employees' privacy and dignity from this kind of intrusion.  If employers wish to transform their employees, they must begin to transform the workplace.</SPAN></P>

Each participant wears appropriate safety equipment and harnesses, and adventure counselors carefully guide participants in order to prevent physical injury.  Although there is a potential for physical injury, I discuss only psychological harm in this article.  Liability for physical injury is fairly straightforward.  If the employer sponsors the program and expects employees to participate and if the employee is physically injured, then the employer will be liable for the injury under the workers' compensation system.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See, e.g.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, Ezzy v.

<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c17">One recent case involving fatalities on a white water rafting trip indicates the potential for liability in the event that participants are injured on corporate outings.  DDB Needham, an advertising agency, organized a white water rafting trip down a treacherous stretch of the Chilko River in British Columbia.  The purpose of the trip was to entertain and woo clients for the firm.  During passage on the river, the raft hit a rock, overturned and threw eleven of the twelve participants into the water.  Five high-level executives were killed, including a retired DDB Needham employee, whose widow sued the company in federal court.  The jury held DDB Needham liable for the death of the retired employee and awarded damages of $ 1.1 million.  At least two more cases growing out of this incident are pending.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> Corsello, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Big Suits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, AM.

Although this case did not involve a corporate adventure program like the ones discussed in this article, the case is similar to adventure programs in that the president of DDB Needham thought that a rafting trip away from the city would &quot;bond&quot; the clients to the ad agency.  The rafting trip was designed to be so challenging and eventful that the participants would develop a permanent relationship from &quot;touching the face of death&quot; together.

These programs often cost several hundred dollars a day per participant.  In a large company, training all employees would be too expensive.  Another reason for limiting the programs to managers is that the emphasis on &quot;risk-taking&quot; assumes that the employee is in a position to make decisions, and most important decisions in American business are made by management.</SPAN></P>

One article presents a graphic description of the effects of insecurity:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The firings, cutbacks, and forced retirements are sending an ominous message to managers . . . . Though most of them have no formal employment contract, they did perceive an implicit contract that practically guaranteed lifetime jobs in exchange for competence, honesty, loyalty, and hard work.  This contract has been broken . . . .  Even those who survive the shake-ups are affected, and this may bode ill for their employers.  Some managers may become more cautious, lest they call attention to themselves.  Anthony Carnevale, chief economist at the American Society for Training and Development, a professional association of human resource managers, says: &quot;The people we expect to be the most creative and flexible now work in the most insecure environment and I don't think that's a good mix.

The core employees are expected to retire early, usually at age 55.  Unlike in American companies, job mobility is extremely limited in Japan.  &quot;Because losing or quitting a job is an admission of inadequacy, any job loss makes it difficult for an individual to find another job of comparable salary, rank and job security.&quot; Billesbach &amp; Rives, at 27. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> TAKING JAPAN SERIOUSLY, at 29-32; FLEXIBLE RIGIDITIES, at 114-15; OUCHI, at 17-25; WEILER, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> note 12, at 68-71.

The outdoor exercises designed to encourage teamwork are not as clearly intended to induce emotional distress.

The teamwork exercises can force employees to be more intimate with co-workers than they might choose to be on their own.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>This pressure to be &quot;close&quot; may cause severe discomfort to those involved.  This is particularly true of outdoor programs, such as the Pecos River Project, that include therapy sessions or intense personal discussions as part of the program.  Unlike corporate retreats, cocktail parties and company picnics, adventure programs demand far more contact and intimacy than is usual at conventional company gatherings.  It is possible to have a working relationship with co-workers that does not involve deep friendship, and employees are entitled to make decisions about friendship on their own.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See infra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> notes 181-93 and accompanying text (discussing forced intimacy as an invasion of privacy).</SPAN></P>

A similar concern with personal autonomy exists with adventure programs that intensively probe participants' most private fears and attitudes in ways not dissimilar to psychotherapy, although without the privacy and safeguards associated with therapy.  While there are no reported cases involving adventure training and similar behavior-modification programs, courts should scrutinize them with the same care as other medical and psychotherapeutic procedures.</SPAN></P>

The company's plan contemplates, rather, that an employee's urine will be taken and tested only if he consents.

This consensual predicate to any test reduces Jenning's argument to her remaining contention.  Jennings contends finally that she is poor and needs her salary to maintain herself and her family.  Consequently, any &quot;consent&quot; she may give, in submitting to urinalysis, will be illusory and not real.  For that practical reason, she argues, the company's plan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">does</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> threaten a non-consensual, and therefore unlawful, invasion of her privacy.  We disagree with the theory.

There cannot be one law of contracts for the rich and another for the poor.  We cannot imagine a theory more at war with the basic assumptions held by society and its law.  Nothing would introduce greater disorder into both.  Because Jennings may not be denied the legal rights others have under the common law of contracts, she may not be given greater rights than they.

They viewed every problem as solvable by telling employers not to force employees to attend or by telling participants that they do not have to take part in exercises that bother them.  These precautions ignore the realities of choice in the workplace and the realities of the very group process that these programs are designed to encourage.  Few employees feel that they can refuse to come, and even fewer feel able to refuse to participate in exercises when other employees do.</SPAN></P>

This kind of breach was treated as a tort because of the disparity in bargaining power between the parties, the special noncommercial character of insurance contracts, the complete dependence on the company when a claim arises, and the inadequacy of contract damages to deter a breach or to compensate the insured.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">&nbsp;Egan v.

For example, in Wallis v. Superior Court, 160 Cal. App. 3d 1109, 207 Cal. Rptr. 123 (1984), the court stated that, as in insurance contracts, there is a clear disparity of power between employers and employees.  Moreover, employees are extremely dependent on employers for salary and benefits, and employees enter into such contracts for financial and personal security.  Therefore, the loss of employment involves more than the loss of income; the trauma of a discharge damages an individual's self-esteem.  As a result, contract damages would not adequately compensate employees because the employees are not generally allowed to recover for mental distress damages.  Furthermore, contract liability does not generally include punitive damages, even when the employer's conduct is outrageous and even when such damages are necessary to deter such conduct in the future.  Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal. 3d 654, 702-03, 707-10, 716 P.2d 373, 402, 405-08, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 241, 244-46 (Broussard, J., dissenting).</SPAN></P>

For a similar argument in favor of a statute enumerating prohibited reasons for discharge instead of a just cause statute, see generally Perritt, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Wrongful Dismissal Legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, 35 UCLA L. REV. 65 (1987). As one commentator said:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Usually, statutes are not enacted because they incorporate good ideas or principles; rather they are enacted because organized interest groups lobby for their enactment.  Employees who have not been organized by a labor union are exactly that: unorganized and therefore lacking in the unity of purpose and effort that produces a successful lobby.  On the other hand, employers have associations that traditionally have lobbied against legislation conflicting with employer interests, and they may be counted upon to oppose legislation that would curtail the present power of employers to terminate employment without proof of cause.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Peck, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> note 272, at 3; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> Perritt, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> at 68-72, 81.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c17">A number of commentators have advocated a just cause statute.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See, e.g.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, Bellace, A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Right to Fair Dismissal: Enforcing a Statutory Guarantee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, 16 U.

L. REV. 7 (1988). Enactment of a just cause statute would help to provide the kind of employment security needed to create the kind of trust, teamwork and commitment that companies expect adventure training to establish.  As indicated earlier, the insecurity associated with the at-will status makes it difficult for employees to make a long term commitment to their employers; they can be discharged at any time.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> notes 64-70 and accompanying text.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c17">n374.&nbsp; Certain kinds of corporate recreational activities do not have the same potential for psychological injury as adventure programs.  For example, companies often have picnics, softball games or other kinds of recreational activities.  While these activities are also designed to create social bonds among employees and between them and the employer, these generally do not pose the kind of psychological risks associated with adventure programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> notes 13-40, and accompanying text (describing adventure training).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c17">This statute does not hold operators of adventure programs liable.

Because corporate adventure programs require the cooperation of employers to deliver employees as participants, a statute prohibiting employers from using such programs should provide an adequate deterrent.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c17">n380.&nbsp; In addition to damages, the statute should also provide for reinstatement and other injunctive relief.

Even so, reinstatment ought to be available if the employee wants to return to the employer's workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Furthermore, to protect employees from retaliation by the employer, this statute should also contain an anti-retaliation provision like those found in many labor statutes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, A.D.E.A. &sect; 4(d), 29 U.S.C. &sect; 263(d)(1982); Civil Rights Act of 1964 tit.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c17">n381.&nbsp; For example, Title VII has been criticized because the staute allows monetary recovery only for lost wages or salaries.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">&nbsp;42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000e-5(g) (1982); Ralston, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">&nbsp;note 371, at 218.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c17">n384.&nbsp; The failure of governmental agencies to enforce labor laws can be due to a number of interrelated factors: (1) the pressure of a conservative political climate hostile to laws protecting employees; (2) the allocation of inadequate resources to enforce the law; and (3) the requirement of time-consuming and cumbersome processes to take any action.

This change would involve removing the &quot;preemptive effort of the N.L.R.A. on the state court's authority to include the right to join a union among the categories of public policy.&quot; At the present time, only the NLRB can handle this and other unfair labor practices under the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The infringer contended that the holder's action was duplicative. The court held that the lawsuit clearly duplicated the holder's prior action because both involved the same parties and the same cause of action and were stated in almost identical language. However, the court held that the most expedient way to resolve the problems created by the duplicate lawsuits was to dismiss the first lawsuit instead of the second. Thus, the court denied the infringer's motion to dismiss the second lawsuit and instead dismissed the first action. The court determined that the interests of judicial efficiency were best served by dismissing without prejudice the first lawsuit, and proceeding to trial on the second lawsuit. The court granted the infringer's motion to trifurcate that previously had been taken under submission due to the complexity of the issues and the large number of potentially infringing products.</SPAN></P>

When a court learns that two possibly duplicative actions are pending on its docket, consolidation may well be the most administratively efficient procedure. If the second complaint proves to contain some new matters, consolidation, unlike dismissal of the second complaint without prejudice or staying the second action, will avoid two trials on closely related matters. If, on the other hand, the second complaint proves to contain nothing new, consolidation of the two actions will cause no harm provided that the district court carefully insures that the plaintiff does not use the tactic of filing two substantially identical complaints to expand the procedural rights he would otherwise have enjoyed.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Pretrial Matters &gt; Separate Trials</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN2] Fed.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   [HN1] &quot;A trial court has discretion to dismiss a complaint which simply duplicates another pending related action.&quot; Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co.. 926 F.2d 1574, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (citing Oliney v. Gardner, 771 F.2d 856 (5th Cir. 1985); Washington Metro. Area Transit Authority v. Ragonese, 617 F.2d 828 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). The court may also stay the second proceeding, or consolidate it with the first:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>When a court learns that two possibly duplicative actions are pending on its docket, consolidation may well be the most administratively efficient procedure. If the second complaint proves to contain some new matters, consolidation -- unlike dismissal of the second complaint without prejudice or staying the second action -- will avoid two trials on closely related matters. If, on the other hand, the second complaint proves to contain nothing new, consolidation of the two actions will cause no harm provided that the district court carefully insures that the plaintiff does not use the tactic of filing two substantially identical complaints to expand the procedural rights he would otherwise have enjoyed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Walton v. Easton, 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1977).&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite plaintiff's arguments to the contrary, the second suit clearly duplicates the first. Both suits involve the same parties and the same cause of action, and are stated in almost identical language. The plaintiff argues that because the appellate court could reverse this court's previous decision not to dismiss the first suit, there is some dispute as to whether the same parties and causes of action are involved in both suits. The court does not agree; the possibility of reversal on appeal does not change the identity of the parties to a lawsuit or the causes of action presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court finds, however, that the most expedient way to resolve the problems created by these duplicate lawsuits is to dismiss the first suit. While the court does not believe that its prior order denying the motion to dismiss the first suit was in error, the court acknowledges that there are grounds for difference of opinion on the issues raised in that motion. The second suit lacks the alleged procedural defects which the defendants contend exist in the first suit. The court finds that the interests of judicial efficiency would be served by dismissing without prejudice the first suit, and proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to trial on the second suit. Thus, the case tried by this court would lack the possibility of appellate reversal on these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the consolidation of the first and second suits, defendant Reebok filed a Motion to Trifurcate. Although filed in Civil Action No. 91-1720, the court shall treat the motion as if it were filed in the duplicate lawsuit as well.  [HN2] Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that &quot;the court, in furtherance of convenience, or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial on any . . . issues.&quot; Due to the complexity of the issues and the large number of potentially infringing products, the court agrees that trifurcation of this matter is in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency. The trial and discovery of this matter shall be conducted in three successive segments: (1) invalidity, unenforceability, and any ancillary issues relating to the plaintiff's right to sustain an action; (2) infringment; and (3) damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS ORDERED that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) the defendant L.A. Gear, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Complaint in Civil Action No. 91-3939 is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">DENIED;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Civil &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Action No. 91-1720 is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">DISMISSED</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without prejudice;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) the defendant Reebok's Motion to Trifurcate is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">GRANTED;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) the trial of this matter be conducted in three successive segments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) invalidity, unenforceability, and any ancillary issues relating to the plaintiff's right to sustain an action; (2) infringment; and (3) damages;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) discovery shall be stayed as to the issues of infringement and damages until the preceding segment has been decided;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) the hearing on the Motion to dismiss C.A. No. 91-3939 set for November 20, 1991 is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">CANCELED.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GREG Norman's absence from the $50 million US circuit, where he was leading money-winner last year with some $1.3 million, has been described as &quot;a sad state of affairs&quot; by tour officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I feel sorry for Greg and I feel he has been over-managed,&quot; said tour commissioner Deane Beman this week, casting a clear barb at the International Management Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life certainly hasn't been easy for the Great White Shark in the US lately. He craves nothing more than to win major championships and the respect of his peers. To him they provide the purest barometers by which to measure true greatness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his failure to emulate the deeds of contemporaries such as Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros has been widely discussed and criticised in magazines and newspapers and he has had to endure many personal attacks as well. Here's a cruel recent example from the once-great Johnny Miller: &quot;... some of the players are saying he has the heart of a grape seed.&quot; And even some spectators have turned against him. After some critical comments about the golf course the previous week in the Honda Classic, the spectators at Bay Hill pointed out that a man who makes millions a year should not be complaining about anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It did not help that Norman pulled out of Tuesday's pro-am at the last minute, saying that he was &quot;over-golfed&quot; and then played in a pro-am the same day at Lost Tree, his home club in West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comments directed at Norman during the Thursday's play included: &quot;Hey, Greg, did Nicklaus give you a release to play here this week?&quot; and &quot;Is the weather OK for you this week, Greggy?&quot; So it's good that the Shark is back in the clutches of his parents, Merv and Toini, for a few weeks, trying to regain touch with his roots, clear his seemingly confused (golfing) mind and play relaxing shots on the familiar terrority of Royal Queensland with his old coach Charlie Earp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEANWHILE the Shark is unwittingly caught up in a storm over television commercials promoting golf shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reebok International Ltd's use of Norman to endorse their &quot;pump&quot; shoes has upset </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so much that the latter is contemplating a lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the commercial Norman uses the words &quot;c'mon Curtis, don't be strange&quot; when promoting his Reebok pumps. Naturally Strange uses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reebok officials say the commercials are done in the fun and spirit of competition, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insists they violate a law that prohibits using the names of athletes in advertising without their permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE said it: Robert Green in Golf World: &quot;Remember those days back in February when Greg Norman was atop the Sony Rankings? Since then he's plummeted almost as fast as the Australian economy.&quot; Nick Faldo: &quot;Everybody wants something different from me. 'Play like Ballesteros. Charm like Palmer. Talk like Trevino.' Well, if they don't like me the way I am... tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biskic's decision to postpone his retirement was announced when he was presented the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Player of the Year award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The midfielder won the honor by polling four votes in Croatia's last two games to beat John Filan by one vote, the leader for most of the season. Biskic announced midway through the campaign this would be his last season, suggesting he should be spending more time with his family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I felt at the time I was having a disappointing season and I was under a lot of pressure because the club was going through an uncertain period (in which coach Ante Grgic was sacked),&quot; Biskic said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have always felt that I could continue playing for two or three more seasons and I probably would have ended up going down to a lower league club where the training demands are not as great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter has swung the other way with Biskic now under pressure to continue playing from the club's committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the club needs me I will stay, but it was more heartening that the coach (Ken Worden) also said he would like me to play on,&quot; Biskic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biskic turned 32 on Monday and described the $2000 prizemoney for the award as the ideal birthday present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've been voted the club's best player twice but I have never before been voted the best player of the competition. I've been close a couple of times but never ended up winning it,&quot; he said. &quot;The award has been great recognition for soccer overall and I hope that it stays next season. It attracted a lot of interest among the players.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national promotions manager George Lawlor, who made the presentation of the trophy and the cash prize to Biskic, said his firm was delighted with its association with the NSL and looked forward to extending it in years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was our first association with soccer at this point and we are delighted with the way it went, as the football boot market is a growing category for us,&quot; Lawlor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biskic was also named player of the year by Australian Soccer Weekly and capped a great season by winning the Martson medal for the best in the NSL grand final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYDNEY: Price is no guide to quality in the high-tech fashion stakes of the running-shoe market, according to the Australian Consumer Association Magazine, Choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magazine said the cheapest shoes tested, selling for as little as $34, protected the feet from injury just as well as the $150 big-name brands like Adidas, Reebok, Puma and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the cheapest shoes were the best casual runners by far.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choice asked Olympic pentathlete Alex Watson to put 12 pairs of running shoes, ranging in price from $34 to $160, through their paces over a 10km course, covering a variety of terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shoes were tested for comfort, moisture evaporation, shock absorption, stability, construction, terrain-riding ability and flexibility and springiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All 12 pairs rated highly, even though prices varied so widely,&quot; the magazine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Price was not a guide to features such as comfort, shock, absorption, stabilility or flexibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magazine said the basic role of running shoes was to protect the foot from injury. But this role was obscured because of high-profile marketing and fashion hype which promoted expensive brands as the triumphs of the tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choice found the Adidas Torsion ZX 4000 C, which costs $150, topped the 12 shoes tested with an overall safety level of 96 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another money-spinner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Craft, selling for $140, ranked third in the list at 94 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the miser's sports shoe, the Dunlop KT 26, at about $34, romped into ninth place at 84 per cent. This cheap shoe equalled the big names in the stability, shock absorption and moisture-evaporation stakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At a third of the price of many other shoes, it is hard to beat as a shoe which provides all the necessary qualities for casual runners, particularly heavy ones, as it offers a very stable, wide base,&quot; the magazine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magazine said running created a constant potential for injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The harder the surface and the heavier the runner, the greater the stress on joints at every step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, the test of a good running shoe is that it must be an effective shock absorber and it must keep the foot stable to prevent ankle injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How the shoes rated for overall safety:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adidas Torsion ZX 4000 C ($120-$150) 96 per cent; Puma-Trinomic 210 ($110-$160) 95; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Craft ($99-$140) 94; Brooks Rage HydroFlow ($75-$140) 92; Reebok Questor ERS ($108-$135) 89; Puma XR ($84-$100) 89; Saucony Freedom 1000 ($88-$120) 88; Asics Gel Runner TN 05 ($97-$130) 88; Hi-Tec Triathon ($71-$110) 85; Dunlop KT 26 ($34-$60) 84; New Balance M495 ($142-$149) 83; Adidas Quorum ($59-$80) 82.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARKET SLUGGISH. The stock market ended mixed in light, lackluster trading Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.25 to close at 2,924.42. Advancing issues narrowly outpaced declining ones in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-BILLS MIXED. Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed Monday as the government auctioned $ 9.22-billion of three-month Treasury bills and $ 9.23-billion of six-month bills. The average discount rate for the three-month bill was 5.50 percent, unchanged from last week, while the average discount rate for the six-month bill was 5.63 percent, up from 5.61 percent. The discount rate understates the return to investors a yield of 5.67 percent on three-month bills and 5.89 percent on six-month bills. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills rose to 6.13 percent last week, up from 6.11 percent the previous week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nation<BR> Production up<BR> in U.S. industries<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON Snapping a six-month decline, the nation's factories, mines and utilities raised production slightly in April as assemblies of trucks and automobiles rebounded, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of 0.1 percent, while neither large nor unexpected, was seen as indicating that the economy was approaching its low point and that a recovery might be imminent.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts were encouraged by the first rise in industrial output since September, but they added that more months of declining output might lie ahead before the economy was clearly seen to be on the mend.<BR> First Executive Corp.<BR> files for protection<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Executive Corp., the troubled life insurance holding company facing billions of dollars in junk bond losses, said Monday that it filed for bankruptcy reorganization.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles comes after California regulators last month seized the ailing holding company's largest insurance unit, Executive Life, in what constituted the largest insurance failure in the nation's history.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any plan to reorganize the firm's companies under new ownership faces the likelihood that hundreds of millions of dollars owed to policyholders, holders of annuities and other securities will not be paid.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Executive Life had been permitted under conservatorship to continue payment of death claims, some medical claims and about 70 percent of certain periodic payments.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payments were being made on 307 pension plans that used First Executive guaranteed investment contracts, which were technically not insured. Monday's bankruptcy filing further clouds the picture for policyholders.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida insurance officials said about 11,000 Floridians hold Executive Life insurance policies, but they do not know how many have annuities or 401(k) investments in the company.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FED TO MEET. The Federal Reserve is facing renewed pressure from the Bush administration and corporate America to supply another round of interest rate cuts to get the country out of the recession. But most economists predicted the central bank will adopt a wait-and-see approach when Fed policymakers meet for a strategy session Tuesday. For that reason, these analysts said that consumer borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, are not likely to decline significantly anytime soon.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADS LAUDED. The shoemaker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. nosed out fragrance maker Calvin Klein as the sponsor of the most popular print advertising campaign of 1990, according to a consumer survey.  Earlier this year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> placed second in a similar survey on television commercials for 1990. Following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Calvin Klein in the Video Storyboard survey were ads for Camel cigarettes, Revlon cosmetics, Absolut vodka, Infiniti cars, Marlboro cigarettes, Guess apparel, Ford automobiles and trucks and Maybelline cosmetics.  Tampa Bay/State<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL PROTEST PLANNED. Sixty Florida farmers will take their campaign against a proposed free trade agreement with Mexico to the lawn of the nation's capital on Wednesday. They will have two rigs loaded with Florida produce and some strong words about how the proposed agreement would harm Florida's $ 6.2-million agricultural industry. State Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford is trying to persuade the Bush administration to keep tariffs in place year-round for citrus and during the growing months of January and February, when Florida is head-to-head in produce production for U.S. markets.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOB EVANS CLOSES OUTLETS. Bob Evans Farms Inc. on Monday closed two of its 255 restaurants, one on U.S. 19 N at Drew Street in Clearwater and the other in the Chicago area. The stores, which were closed because they were unprofitable, will be sold, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said. The Clearwater store opened in 1987.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUTMEG EARNINGS. Tampa-based Nutmeg Industries Inc. on Monday reported a continued earnings rebound with first quarter profits of $ 155,000, or 3 cents a share, compared to a loss of $ 292,000 in the comparable quarter in 1990. Sales rose 85 percent to $ 17.1-million, up from $ 9.2-million.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 INDUSTRIALS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2924.42&nbsp;+4.25<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOLLAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JAPANESE YEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.75<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BONDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30-YEAR U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.27%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -0.07<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STOCKS DECLINE. The stock market drifted lower in slow trading Monday, still restrained by worries over rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 50.76 points last week, slipped 1.34 to 2,975.40.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-BILLS RISE. Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose Monday as the government auctioned $ 10-billion of three-month Treasury bills and $ 10.1-billion of six-month bills. The average discount rate for the three-month bill was 5.60 percent, up from 5.59 percent last week, while the average discount rate for the six-month bill was 5.78 percent, up from 5.71 percent. The discount rate understates the return to investors a yield of 5.78 percent on three-month bills and 6.05 percent on six-month bills. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills rose to 6.30 percent last week, up from 6.13 percent the previous week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nation<BR> Ch. 13 parent gets<BR> filing extension<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federal bankruptcy judge in Denver has extended until June 25 the date that the parent company of WTVT-Ch. 13 has to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the nation's largest financial companies are trying to force Gillett Holdings Inc., which also owns television stations in Baltimore and California and two Colorado ski resorts, into the reorganization.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Gillett, the Colorado executive who owns the junk-bond indebted Gillett Holdings, has been seeking to renegotiate the concern's debts out of court.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Sidney Brooks on Monday ruled Gillett cannot have any further extensions, but the company has until June 25 because the Gillett's talks with creditors haven't been successful.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BANK BILL TARGETED. Rep. John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is trying to derail the Bush administration's proposed banking system overhaul from the legislative fast track. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., wants to move a comprehensive banking bill through the House before Congress recesses in early August. That likely would leave Dingell's panel with only a few weeks to review the legislation. In an 11-page letter to Foley released Monday, Dingell, D-Mich., argued he needed more time. Dingell is skeptical about key elements of the bill, including permitting commercial and industrial firms to own banks and allowing banks to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INVENTOR SUES </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Arlington, Va., inventor is putting on a full-court press against one of Michael Jordan's biggest backers, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. Charles Petrosky, a 73-year-old inventor who works out of a cluttered shop in his basement, claims in a federal suit in Alexandria, Va., that the manufacturing giant swiped his invention when it marketed the Air Jordan sneaker, named after the Chicago Bulls' star guard.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAS PRICES RISE. What do you get when you mix falling wholesale gasoline prices with a recession that has dampened demand? If you answered lower prices at the pump, you may be wrong. In one of those curiosities that seems peculiar to the oil business, motorists seem to be paying more and more for gasoline each week, even though some dealers are paying less. Critics say the major oil companies are once again exploiting consumers because summer driving season is here. The American Petroleum Institute said gasoline prices typically rise in the summer because of refining processes triggered by higher demand. The API also cited higher taxes and a higher per-barrel cost of crude oil.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNISYS NEARS SETTLEMENT. Unisys Corp. is nearing agreement with federal prosecutors to settle fraud charges stemming from schemes to obtain confidential bid information on defense contracts, government sources said Monday. The computer systems manufacturer, which has a plant in Oldsmar, could end up paying as much as $ 190-million to settle allegations arising from the Justice Department investigation known as &quot;Operation Ill Wind,&quot; said government sources.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEDERATED BILLS CLIMBING. Legal fees are approaching $ 90-million in the 17 months since Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a court trustee said. &quot;We've tried to control the fees,&quot; said bankruptcy court trustee Conrad Morgenstern. The companies, headquartered in Cincinatti, operate such retail stores as Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh and Burdines. Morgenstern said that if it takes $ 100-million in legal fees to bring a $ 10-billion company out of bankruptcy, that represents only 1 percent of the company's assets.<BR> Corrections<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jacaranda chapter of the American Business Women's Association will meet at 6 p.m. Saturday at Las Fontanas Restaurant, 15481 49th St. N, Clearwater.

Zillions, the kidversion of Consumer Reports, proved it. They heard the same run-faster, jump-higher playground myth and decided to test it out. When they outfitted their kid testers in three kinds of shoes the Reebok Pump, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quantum Force they found that the kids jumped to exactly the same heights in all three models, and actually ran a little bit slower in the Pumps, which were noticeably heavier than the other two. When the testers were told they could keep the shoes they liked best, nobody chose Pumps.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Morgan, those results may need updating soon. Since Reebok introduced the first Pump, he says, they've streamlined its air-pump technology. The Pump they'll introduce in August, he says, weighs only 15 ounces per shoe, more than five ounces lighter than the model Zillions tested.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still won't make you run faster or jump higher. What it does do, Morgan says, is reduce ankle injuries. He says tests at the University of California at Berkeley matched 200 kids in low-tops against 200 kids in regular high-tops and 200 kids in Pumps and found that the Pump cut ankle injuries by 60 percent.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where did the run-faster, jump-higher rap come from? Morgan doesn't know, but it doesn't surprise him. Kids, he says, &quot;have a tendency to build stories around shoes.&quot; For instance, a black high-top basketball shoe Reebok happened to introduce shortly after the death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias came to be known in the Washington, D.C., area as the Len Bias Memorial Shoe. And, on New England playgrounds, the black high-top Pump that the Boston Celtics' Dee Brown wears and that he so effectively called attention to during the NBA All Stars Slam-Dunk Contest last February by pumping and repumping before every try is known as the Deebok.<BR> - Patricia McLaughlin has written for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Washington Post and Rolling Stone magazine.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Daniels, a former star runner and an exercise physiologist for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> competitive team, said Wednesday she has been hired as the University of South Florida's first full-time cross country and track assistant.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm really excited to be here; I used to run Division I and I'm excited to be back to Division I in a big way,&quot; Daniels said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniels had been informally assisting her husband, Jack, at Cortland State, N.Y., since 1986. The women's team there won the NCAA Division III cross-country championships in 1989 and 1990 and the indoor track title in 1990-91.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We struggled with it for a week,&quot; Daniels said of leaving New York and her husband, who will retire from coaching at the end of this school year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USF coach Bob Braman, whohas run both the men's and women's programs over the years, echoed those sentiments.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's got the credentials to really help us,&quot; he said. &quot;Her teams were Division III, but they were good enough to be top 10 in Division I. She's going to be a strong draw for us and she's strong in areas I'm not.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniels, 32, formerly Nancy Scardina, was one of the University of New Hampshire's best runners ever. She led the team to the NCAA cross-country championships in 1981 and to the NCAA outdoor track championships in 1982. In 1988, she qualified for the U.S.  Olympic Trials in the marathon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then worked physiologically and nutritionally with the nation's premier runners, including Mary Decker and Joan Benoit while at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Athletes West from 1983-86. She also has published numerous papers on the exercise physiology of runners.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's helped,&quot; she said. &quot;I like giving people facts about running and see their eyes open. People don't like to believe you, but they can't dispute scientific facts and say, &quot;That's not what my high school coach told me.' I really love working with the kids.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USF women's program, just four years old, won its first cross-country title of any kind, the Sun Belt Conference crown, last fall under part-time assistant Judy Bogenschutz. Bogenschutz chose not to return and to concentrate on her running career.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, track will officially become a varsity sport at USF and the budget for men's and women's cross country and track will double, from $ 110,000 to $ 215,000. Scholarships will be increased from four to seven for the men and the women alike.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the prospect of Thanksgiving overindulgence leaves you feeling guilty, here's one way to ease a calorie-counting conscience and help others, too.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thanksgiving morning, Tuff Stuff exercise coordinators Joan Kilpatrick and Susan Harrod will conduct a special bench workout at Shore Acres Community Center. A donation of one non-perishable food item gets you in the class. Bring four more and you'll be eligible for door prizes that include exercise tapes, massages, pastries, free Tuff Stuff classes and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sneakers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's not enough, consider this: The food you bring will help fill the cupboards of the St. Petersburg Free Clinic Food Bank and feed those who won't have the same opportunities to indulge during the holiday season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it will be particularly helpful this year because the need is so great,&quot; said Sister Margaret Freeman, executive director of St.  Petersburg's Free Clinic. &quot;They (Kilpatrick and Harrod) are doing a great job of creating interest.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workout began six years ago and has become a Shore Acres tradition. Last year, 102 participants brought so much food it took four cars to haul it away. Harrod said the class began as a way to get people exercising during the holidays. A food drive was added the following year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We started going crazy (with activities),&quot; Harrod said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workout got bigger and busier every Thanksgiving.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the workout's door prizes are donated by radio stations, national exercise programs and local businesses. A chef will prepare strudels and Napoleons on site during the workout, then donate them as prizes. David Pittman will bring in a sound system for an added boost.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's kind of exciting,&quot; Harrod said. &quot;The person who donates the most canned goods we crown her the Can Queen. Last year, the Can Queen brought in something like 70 cans.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being crowned queen has benefits. This year's prize package includes a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a leotard and three months of Tuff Stuff classes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happens if the person bringing the most cans is male?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's still the Can Queen,&quot; Harrod said. &quot;That's what the sash says.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the jovial atmosphere, Harrod and Kilpatrick are serious about their mission. Kilpatrick said she hopes participants will try to bring the foods needed most. Peanut butter, jelly, rice, soup, beans, powdered milk, dry cereal, canned meats and vegetables, dried or canned fruits, and boxed macaroni and cheese head the list.  If possible, bring the food in large paper bags that can be reused when the food is distributed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items with limited value are gourmet foods, such as caviar; foods that require added meat or have an expired freshness date; refrigerated products; and foods that must be prepared in a microwave. The Food Bank already has a good supply of baby food.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is any indication, the class should fill up quickly. Harrod said about 85 benches from community centers throughout St.  Petersburg have been brought in for the step up/step down workout. Because each person needs a bench, the class size is limited to the number of benches.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the workout so popular? &quot;I think it's just that there's nothing to do (on Thanksgiving morning),&quot; Harrod said, &quot;and plus, they feel guilty (about overeating).&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JOYCE CARTER<BR> The Globe and Mail<BR> COLE-Haan, the giant international shoe and handbag concern, opens its<BR>first Canadian store to the public Saturday at 101 Bloor West.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    To judge by the furnishings, attention to detail is foremost in the<BR>minds of the principles. The ceilings have domed centres with hand-cast<BR>bas-relief faces of foxes, mountain lions and the like. Display cases have<BR>bands of other hand-carved animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were done as a tribute to Canada, to say thank you to Toronto for<BR>welcoming us,&quot; explains Cathy Taylor, the firm's vice-president retail.<BR>She was born and raised here and admits to a lingering fondness for her<BR>home town, &quot;so I've been looking at Toronto for the past five years,&quot; with<BR>a view of just such a store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the timing has to be right and you must have the right location,&quot;<BR>so they waited until the prime corner site became available. Only then did<BR>Barton A. Forbes of Forbes Associates, Falmouth, Maine, get started on the<BR>design, a task he's repeated a dozen times for flagship stores around the<BR>world, including Beverly Hills, New York, Florence and Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which projects sales of $150-million U.S. in the coming<BR>year, is based in Yarmouth, Maine. Shoes, handbags and accessories<BR>(including cabin trunks for luxury liners) are produced in the United<BR>States, Italy, England, Brazil and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the shoes, Ms Taylor says &quot;we are specialists in fitting,<BR>we are very confident in our fit. Americans understand this, we use<BR>different lasts than they do in Italy. Italian lasts are more tapered from<BR>the ball of the foot to the toe, we make a fuller toe. Italian lasts are<BR>shallow at the toe, ours are much higher for comfort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean they sacrifice style. For all the firm has been owned<BR>by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. since 1988, there's no sign of the runners in the Cole-Haan<BR>stores. &quot;We operate as two separate companies. We do have a group of<BR>products - Tensile Air - which puts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> technology into a dress shoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The examples look just like any other street shoes but inside, they're<BR>cushioned &quot;they have the air built in, they will never deflate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's just one group among many: everything from classic American<BR>country footwear to sleek Italian slip-ons. Many of the shoes, as well as<BR>handbags, come in woven leather and the same technique is applied to satin<BR>for the perfect tuxedo pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prices, she figures, will be about 17 per cent higher than in the<BR>United States, to cover the difference in the dollar and the higher cost<BR>of doing business here. Stock for their Canadian wholesale accounts will<BR>be housed in the basement. (&quot;No, I don't think that makes us competitors<BR>with stores like Harry Rosen, we've been selling to him for years. It just<BR>means greater recognition of our name.&quot;)<BR>   There are at present no plans to open other Canadian stores. &quot;You've<BR>got to have a starting point. You've got to do well before you go on. This<BR>is the city we have confidence in now. We believe very strongly in<BR>Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mid-1950s, European ski boots that pioneered the technology were<BR>available in North America - although we can remember one broken ankle<BR>that they did not prevent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shoe business is basically an advertising game. The company with<BR>the best marketing strategy wins, and right now Reebok is the leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its shares trade at $30.75 (U.S.) in New York, an amazing recovery from<BR>the 52-week low of $8.87. Can it go any higher?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, says Value Line Inc. of New York. Reebok has introduced a product<BR>known as Blacktop, a shoe for youngsters who play hockey, baseball,<BR>football and basketball on driveways and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally, kids who love asphalt sports will play them, no matter what<BR>they wear on their feet. Blacktop shoes should appeal to the ones who<BR>don't, but pretend they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's competitors include the following:<BR>   L.A. Gear Inc. of Los Angeles. It was saved from bankruptcy this week<BR>by selling $100-million worth of shares to Trefoil Capital Investors. Does<BR>Trefoil have marketing smarts? Probably not, but L.A. Gear does have a<BR>distribution system reaching into 100 countries, and has a cool image that<BR>might serve it well in Eastern European markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. of Beaverton, Ore. Volatile stock, and has a problem with its<BR>name. Is it Ny-kee? Knee-kee? Neeck? Or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as in like? One basic rule<BR>for investors is to stay away from shares of companies that have names<BR>they cannot pronounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stride Rite Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. This company makes the Keds line.<BR>Your curtain-crawlers may hate them, but Keds sneakers work just as well<BR>as Reeboks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine World Wide Corp. of Rockford, Minn. Many upscale households<BR>in North America have at least one pair of its products: Hush Puppies and<BR>Brooks, for example. With quality brand names and licencing agreements in<BR>the world's most prosperous markets, executives can farm out manufacturing<BR>to low-cost countries and be home in time for dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many North American companies and their employees decry U.S.<BR>efforts to create a Western Hemisphere free-trade zone, the shoe business<BR>should benefit. Instead of out-sourcing manufacturing to Asia, it can be<BR>brought closer to markets, and everybody, including Canadian investors and<BR>consumers, wins.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY SUEIN L. HWANG<BR>The Wall Street Journal<BR>  New York<BR> FORGET leg lifts and abdominal crunches. Today's aerobics instructors are<BR>turning to reggae, tai chi, hip hop and even prayer to lure aging baby<BR>boomers back into the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;You wouldn't believe the goofy stuff we've seen,&quot; says Gordie Nye,<BR>marketing director for Reebok International Ltd., which is always on the<BR>lookout for new fitness routines that it can promote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years ago, it took little more than a slim figure, a loud voice and<BR>a disco beat to get fat-obsessed yuppies to go for the burn. Aerobics<BR>routines, the invention of a California housewife, began with the simple<BR>marriage of music and calisthenics. Aerobics introduced a generation of<BR>women to the world of fitness and created a $1-billion (U.S.) market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the recession, concern about possible injury and general boredom<BR>with aerobics have led to a slide in participation. A recent survey in the<BR>United States by the National Sporting Goods Association found that the<BR>number of people performing aerobics more than once in the past year has<BR>fallen 2.8 per cent since 1985 and sales of aerobics footwear in 1990<BR>dropped to 9.8 million pairs from 10.8 million in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many sports researchers believe the aerobics boom has come and gone.<BR>Many of the women who started working out in aerobics classes have been<BR>lured away by stair-climbing machines, Rollerblading and other forms of<BR>exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a faddist group among active people and they've already gone<BR>on to a third and fourth thing,&quot; says Thomas Doyle, research director at<BR>the National Sporting Goods Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even skeptics concede that the aerobics industry has succeeded in<BR>maintaining a loyal following by reinventing itself when necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aerobics routines, at one time little more than a series of kicks and<BR>jumps, have grown more sophisticated, integrating jazzier moves and safer<BR>&quot;low-impact&quot; approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ambitious entrepreneurs are promoting what they hope will be the<BR>next successful incarnation of aerobics. Reebok succeeded in promoting<BR>step aerobics - stepping on and off an elevated bench - and now it is<BR>willing to invest millions of dollars on promotion if it can come up with<BR>a promising new form of exercise that will help sell sportswear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it take to gain attention? First, find a gimmick. Reebok, of<BR>Canton, Mass., experimented with a California-born notion called<BR>Kneedspeed, in which the exerciser makes skating motions on a piece of<BR>linoleum in stocking feet. But the company finally abandoned the concept<BR>because it didn't seem to have strong appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, D.C., the Synergy Studio offers a &quot;holistic&quot; approach.<BR>&quot;There's a spiritual need for people to connect with their bodies,&quot; says<BR>Roger Piantadosi, co-owner of the studio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classes begin with meditative quiet and are designed around five<BR>natural elements, such as water. In one recent class, a group of mostly<BR>affluent professionals in their 30s pounded their bare feet to the beat of<BR>African drums and slapped their stomachs while emitting hoarse grunts.<BR>&quot;Around the fire and the Earth,&quot; commanded instructor Charmaine Schore as<BR>the women shook convulsively while lying on their backs. &quot;Draw the spirit<BR>to you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Synergy Studio grossed $195,000 in 1990, up 30 per cent from the year<BR>before, and it now has plans to develop videos and train more instructors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others take a celestial approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As instructor Jeannie Blocher leads a class at Body &amp; Soul Ministries<BR>Inc. in Germantown, Md., the words to a song blare out: &quot;It won't be long<BR>'til we see Jesus. It won't be long 'til He'll be here, yeah, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This non-profit program counts more than 200 aerobics teachers in its<BR>non-denominational clergy. Ms. Blocher hopes to expand the program and<BR>plans a video release. &quot;I would like to see it spread and just continue as<BR>the Lord wishes,&quot; says the 42-year-old mother of three. &quot;We call ourselves<BR>Body and Soul Missionaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deferring to the aging of their target market, many programs have<BR>eliminated difficult jumping or kicking moves while focusing on new ethnic<BR>beats. Esther Gutierrez-Sloan, a Colombian immigrant and president of<BR>Salsarobics Inc., hopes her Latin-styled aerobics will help her rumba<BR>right past the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former computer consultant is looking for outside investors to<BR>finance an ambitious business plan that includes franchises and a line of<BR>workout wear. &quot;The music's very unique and culturally educational,&quot; she<BR>says. &quot;And it makes women feel sensual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everybody's convinced that new forms of aerobics will have much<BR>effect on demand. &quot;Yes, you're going to bring in different kinds of<BR>people,&quot; says Kathie Davis, executive director of IDEA, an industry group.<BR>&quot;But you aren't going to have a massive effect on the numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than promote specialized aerobics routines, Reebok rival </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inc. is focusing on the versatility of its aerobics shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of Beaverton, Ore., says sales of its cross-training shoes are up<BR>&quot;very significantly&quot; from past years and it has started a marketing<BR>campaign featuring its Elite aerobic shoes in a variety of workouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women do many things in their lives and a step-aerobics shoe isn't<BR>that uniquely different&quot; from other aerobics shoes, says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aerobics<BR>apparel marketing manager. &quot;We can't all own five pairs of shoes.&quot;<BR>  Reprinted with permission of The Wall Street Journal<BR>1991 Dow Jones &amp; Co.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">845 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY MARTY YORK<BR> IS the Rocket on the verge of flying off to the National Football League?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Well, one of the premier football reporters in the United States is<BR>telling his viewers and readers that he has definite and irrefutable<BR>information that Raghib Ismail - otherwise known as the Rocket - will be<BR>employed in the NFL by next season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And maybe even before the end of this NFL season,&quot; Fred Edelstein said<BR>in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every piece of information I have indicates that the length of<BR>Rocket's career with the Toronto Argonauts will be exactly one season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's on his way to the Los Angeles Raiders. I wouldn't be surprised,<BR>in fact, if the Raiders have him in a uniform by next month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edelstein's track record on football scoops is outstanding. Viewers of<BR>his weekly program on ESPN and readers of the well-circulated Edelstein<BR>Pro Football Letter can attest to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Don Crump didn't do much to dispel Edelstein's information when I<BR>spoke to him yesterday. In fact, the Canadian Football League commissioner<BR>backed it up pretty well when he admitted that Argo governor Sue Waks<BR>recently told him in an angry moment that club owner Bruce McNall was<BR>considering the notion of sending Ismail to the Raiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said, 'Don't think Bruce won't send Rocket over to Al,' &quot; Crump<BR>said. &quot;She meant Al, as in Al Davis (owner of the Raiders).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who knows? If the Rocket leaves, maybe it'll be the start of a trend<BR>for the CFL. Maybe a lot of big-name players will come over for one season<BR>and then go to the NFL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached in Los Angeles yesterday, Waks denied making any threats about<BR>Ismail to Crump. She also said Ismail has enjoyed his rookie season with<BR>the Argos and that she would be &quot;shocked&quot; if he jumped to the Raiders<BR>after the CFL season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beverly Ballard, whom Ismail employs as a public-relations aide, echoed<BR>Waks's sentiments, saying that the Rocket intends to honour all four<BR>seasons of his $18-million, Argonaut contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what you must understand,&quot; Edelstein said, &quot;is that the NFL and<BR>the CFL are leagues of denial. They deny everything. It's just a mode of<BR>operation for them. The fact that they deny something doesn't mean<BR>anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were operating the Argos, or if I were the Rocket, I'd deny the<BR>whole thing, too. What purpose would it serve to confirm that he's leaving<BR>right before the playoffs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you can be sure it's happening. The Rocket will end up with about<BR>$6-million from McNall and will then accept a deal for a lot less from<BR>Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if things were gangbusters in Toronto, if the Argos were selling<BR>out the place and there was Argomania, it would be incumbent to continue<BR>the deal. But being that none of this has happened, that the signing<BR>really hasn't produced an outstanding television deal in the States,<BR>McNall has a nice parachute. He can just hand the Rocket over to the<BR>Raiders, and the Rocket won't mind, no matter what anyone else says<BR>publicly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest edition of his publication, Edelstein wrote:<BR>   &quot;We hear Ismail is definitely hot on joining the Raiders next year. Our<BR>sources say he is having fun in Canada and that his relationship with<BR>Bruce McNall is pretty good. But the CFL isn't the NFL and Rocket<BR>apparently misses the United States and the bright lights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technically, players are not permitted to toil in the CFL and NFL in<BR>the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But,&quot; Edelstein said, &quot;when it becomes clear that Rocket's not coming<BR>back to Toronto and that he can get out of his CFL deal and his personal<BR>services contract with McNall, it might be possible for the Raiders to<BR>make a strong argument for getting him before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I'm hearing out of the Raiders and people who are close to<BR>the Rocket, this is the way it's going. I won't say it's a done deal, but<BR>understand that Al Davis is a shrewd man. He knows that the Rocket wants<BR>to play in the NFL. He knows exactly to the dime how much McNall is<BR>losing. And he has a friendship with McNall in Los Angeles. He knows about<BR>the escape clauses in Rocket's deal. This would not be a hostile<BR>situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, McNall has taken a bit of a bath on this thing. He took a<BR>courageous shot and it didn't really pay off the way he'd hoped. The<BR>easiest way to get out of this is to let Rocket go to the Raiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By selecting Rocket in the last NFL draft, Al Davis has him exactly<BR>where he wants him. He's not going to bring in the Rocket and pay him $3-<BR>million a year. He doesn't have to. If he pays him any more than $1.5-<BR>million a year, I'd be shocked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edelstein, incidentally, also reported that the Rocket has fired his<BR>agent, Ed Abrams, over a decision to turn down a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the recent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial with Bo Jackson dancing in a<BR>broadway show set?&quot; Edelstein wrote. &quot;Sources close to the Ismail<BR>situation say that was supposed to be Rocket's commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way we hear it, Rocket's mother was furious over the decision to<BR>blow off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that the Rocket fired Abrams at his mother's urging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preferred Management, a firm put together in part by former tennis star<BR>Arthur Ashe, is now handling Ismail's finances. And the firm apparently<BR>has close ties with Al Davis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late 1960s, while coaching the freshman team at Rutgers for&nbsp;Bill Foster, Valvano was sent to Long Island to check out a 6-foot-3&nbsp;center touted by his brother. Valvano wasn't impressed, and here's the&nbsp;rest of the story:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the kid visited Rutgers on his own anyway and still seemed very&nbsp;interested, but I convinced Foster he couldn't play at our level and that&nbsp;we should go after another player named Alan Cotler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lost Cotler to Penn. He's now a lawyer in Philadelphia. I lost&nbsp;track of the other kid. He was in Philly, too, but I think he became a&nbsp;doctor or something. You ever hear of him? Kid's name is Julius Erving.&quot;; A fresh start</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudy Galindo is back at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships this&nbsp;year, but as a solo performer, rather than as a defending pairs champion,&nbsp;now that his former partner, Kristi Yamaguchi, has decided to concentrate&nbsp;on her solo career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galindo has made one more adjustment in returning to singles for the&nbsp;first time since 1988: The spelling of his first name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had changed it from Rudy to Rudi to match with Kristi,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&quot;I'm into a new life and wanted everything to be fresh. So I'm back to&nbsp;Rudy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galindo smiles, jokes and avoids saying anything that could be&nbsp;construed as sour grapes about the end of his pairing with Yamaguchi. But&nbsp;it's apparent he was hurt by the parting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of hard to be out there by yourself,&quot; Galindo said this&nbsp;week as he prepared for the start of the championships. &quot;A few times, I&nbsp;went to grab Kristi's hand, and it was not there.&quot;; A K' for history</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark it down for posterity: Reid Ryan, 19-year-old son of Nolan,&nbsp;struck out the first batter he faced as a freshman at the University of&nbsp;Texas. The victim was a friend, Shayne Currin of Texas-Arlington, who&nbsp;spends his summers as bullpen catcher for the Texas Rangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid Ryan's fastball was clocked in the 85 mph range, and his&nbsp;curveball was sharp as he pitched two innings, giving up one run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His dad didn't make the 150-mile trip from Alvin to Austin for the&nbsp;debut. But they'll see each other April 2 as opposing pitchers in an&nbsp;exhibition game.; He's learning fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Associated Press: When Wayne Gretzky turned 30 last month,&nbsp;Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall gave him a horse they saw being born&nbsp;while they were at the Kentucky Derby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gretzky and McNall are partners in the racing business, so Gretzky&nbsp;gave half back to McNall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept the front half, because I have learned that is the one that&nbsp;crosses the finish line first,&quot; joked Gretzky.; For the record . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Canada's Helen Kelesi rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the third set&nbsp;to upset third-seeded Jana Novotna 2-6, 7-6, 7-6 in the second round of&nbsp;the Virginia Slims of Chicago tennis tournament.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The room was a blur of silk suits, highball glasses and eggrolls.&nbsp;The smell of merchandising was in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, everybody at the Diversified Products (DP) cocktail and&nbsp;elbow-rubbing party Thursday night already knew which advertising vehicle&nbsp;was about to glide into the room. They had just seen a 10-minute video of&nbsp;Bo making a running catch in the outfield, Bo running for a touchdown, Bo&nbsp;breaking a bat over his knee, Bo scoring for Auburn, Bo doing that&nbsp;Arsenio thing, Bo filming a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial, Bo chugging a sports drink,&nbsp;Bo pushing AT&amp;T and Cheerios and Pepsi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. . . &quot;Bo Jackson!&quot; DP president Cal James, completing his&nbsp;introduction, said to his audience of some 300 buyers at the Westin&nbsp;Peachtree Plaza Hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson didn't so much glide into the room as he hobbled. He hobbled&nbsp;everywhere Thursday. The man of two sports and a zillion products was on&nbsp;crutches, the result of a hip injury last month in a Los Angeles Raiders&nbsp;playoff game. He will be on crutches for four weeks and may, according to&nbsp;a team doctor for his other employer, the Kansas City Royals, miss the&nbsp;season opener.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that didn't stop the dominant sports figure from enhancing his&nbsp;dominant marketing presence. Jackson flew into Atlanta from Auburn about&nbsp;1 p.m. and in the next eight hours: (1) posed for publicity pictures with&nbsp;a young boy for the March of Dimes, (2) held a fireside chat with top&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executives and buyers in conjunction with the Super Show (he was not&nbsp;out for public or media display), (3) was introduced as the part owner&nbsp;and product spokesman for &quot;Bo Med,&quot; a sports medicine line manufactured&nbsp;by Cramer Products, at a Georgia World Congress Center news conference,&nbsp;(4) was introduced in grand style at the Westin as part owner and chief&nbsp;spokesman for a new line of weightlifting equipment to be manufactured by&nbsp;DP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then? Bo hobbled into a waiting limo at about 9 p.m. and was&nbsp;whisked to the airport, where he caught a return flight to Auburn. Why&nbsp;the rush?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has a final exam to take tomorrow,&quot; said Susann McKee, who as an&nbsp;associate to Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, is charged with making sure&nbsp;Bo knows punctuality. &quot;He's still working on his degree in child and&nbsp;family development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo needs no courses on income development. He will earn nearly $ 4&nbsp;million in the next baseball and football seasons from the Royals ($ 2.375&nbsp;million) and the Raiders ($ 1.6175 million) - and that is dwarfed by his&nbsp;off-field(s) earnings. Bo also has become quite polished on speaking to&nbsp;business executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he wouldn't discuss his injury Thursday. Royals trainer Steve&nbsp;Joyce said Jackson &quot;isn't in the mild injury category.&quot; But when asked at&nbsp;the &quot;Bo Med&quot; gathering if he would be ready in time for the Royals season&nbsp;opener, Jackson said, &quot;Man, I'm not here to talk about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when explaining the advantages of his &quot;Bo Med&quot; ankle brace,&nbsp;Jackson joked, &quot;We need to make one of these for a hip injury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More jokes flowed at the DP cocktail party. &quot;I never knew DP made&nbsp;more weights than anybody in the country,&quot; Bo said. &quot;See, that's&nbsp;something Bo doesn't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Tarkanian's friends are as diverse as they are loyal, their&nbsp;presence never more than a plane flight or phone call away. One owns a&nbsp;hair salon in Las Vegas. Another is the ex-husband of actress Diahann&nbsp;Carroll. Still another is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive who treads lightly anywhere&nbsp;near the NCAA. Others are more high profile - Bobby Knight and John&nbsp;Thompson, Dick Vitale, and a large number of coaches and scouts from the&nbsp;NBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as Nevada-Las Vegas pursues its second consecutive national&nbsp;championship this weekend in Indianapolis, Tarkanian's friends join his&nbsp;foes in wondering whether the NCAA's pursuit of the embattled coach - and&nbsp;anticipated sanctions at season's end - finally will prompt either his&nbsp;retirement or a departure to the NBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tark isn't telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it's because he himself is uncertain. On a given day, he&nbsp;professes to be a college coaching lifer, best suited for 40 minutes of&nbsp;frenzy and 30-odd games in a community that is appreciative, if not&nbsp;always approving, of his methods. (He has his detractors in Las Vegas,&nbsp;too.) Yet, on another day, Tarkanian ponders life after Vegas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe I should go to the NBA,&quot; he offers, frowning. &quot;I don't need&nbsp;all this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 60, Tarkanian clearly could rest on his coaching laurels. He has&nbsp;a career record of 811-145, is the second-winningest active Division I&nbsp;coach with 598 victories and has guided the Runnin' Rebels to 45&nbsp;consecutive wins, one NCAA title and a second straight trip to the Final&nbsp;Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He earns $ 203,000 in salary, $ 200,000 for a shoe contract and&nbsp;approximately $ 250,000 in free tickets to UNLV games. But he also has&nbsp;received 19 years of intense scrutiny and an assortment of penalties&nbsp;levied by the NCAA. This year, for instance, the Rebels were banned from&nbsp;appearing on television in 1992 and from participating in the postseason&nbsp;tournament, sanctions levied for violations dating back to the 1970s. The&nbsp;Rebels also are confronting 29 new allegations pertaining to the&nbsp;recruitment of New York prep star Lloyd Daniel, and reportedly are being&nbsp;investigated again for the recruitment of Los Angeles area prep star Ed&nbsp;O'Bannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no program in the country that receives one-tenth the&nbsp;scrutiny we do,&quot; said Tarkanian. &quot;Every player who leaves our program,&nbsp;they are trying to find something on. Our kids don't deserve this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does Tarkanian? While his national image may be tarnished, he&nbsp;enjoys surprisingly strong support from unlikely sources, including&nbsp;Thompson, Knight, former UCLA coach John Wooden, former Cal coach Pete&nbsp;Newell, Seton Hall's P.J. Carlesimo and Utah's Rick Majerus. &quot;I'm not&nbsp;anti-NCAA or anything,&quot; Majerus said recently, &quot;but most of the coaches&nbsp;really like Tark. They think he's a good guy, a very decent person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, those close to him are alert for signs of trouble, for&nbsp;any indications that the pressure finally has worn him down. Yet they say&nbsp;none is visible. Tarkanian has no hair to lose (he shaves his head), is&nbsp;not a heavy drinker and remains in relatively good shape for his years.&nbsp;Even his warm and engaging personality, they maintain, has remained&nbsp;consistent, as has his professional persona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Tarkanian capitalizes on every opportunity to publicly flail&nbsp;the NCAA for its &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and plead his case to every reporter and&nbsp;for any interested publication, he responds to attacks on his program and&nbsp;his character with an amazing grace. For those who have yet to meet&nbsp;Tarkanian, the publicity staff schedules individual interviews like an&nbsp;all-comers' meet: You come to UNLV, you meet Tark. And even his most&nbsp;relentless critics relate how he continues to accept their phone calls,&nbsp;and often engages them in conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jerry doesn't stay mad at anybody,&quot; said UNLV publicist Joe Hawk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter who wrote a damaging&nbsp;article in December 1989 about the high-priced cars several of the Rebel&nbsp;players were driving around town, Hawk subsequently was hired as the&nbsp;school's sports information director without opposition from Tarkanian.&nbsp;&quot;It was a little awkward at first,&quot; said Hawk, &quot;but Jerry's been very&nbsp;good to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone appears to have succumbed to the pressure, it would be a&nbsp;few of the players, though even this is arguable. After Hawk's story&nbsp;broke, Stacey Augmon and Larry Johnson initiated a team-wide ban on&nbsp;speaking to the media, though most of the Rebels relented during last&nbsp;year's postseason tournament. Augmon again refused to speak with&nbsp;reporters for most of this past season, despite encouragement to do so by&nbsp;Tarkanian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a player, the Rebels remain true to their coach and his cause. At&nbsp;times, Johnson said, the controversy served only to strengthen their&nbsp;resolve and unite an already close-knit group. Before the tip-off of each&nbsp;game during the NCAA Tournament, for instance, the players embrace&nbsp;quietly, seemingly for themselves rather than for effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarkanian, too, sees this, and it makes him wonder even further&nbsp;about the NBA. At UNLV, he rules not unlike Knight, Thompson, or any&nbsp;number of other major-college coaches. He controls. He dictates. He&nbsp;doesn't like a player, the player isn't around the following year. He&nbsp;doesn't like the schedule, the schedule is altered. He doesn't like the&nbsp;uniforms, new ones are on order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can he claim this power in the NBA? Not likely, and he knows it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just don't see him leaving,&quot; Sonny Vaccaro, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive,&nbsp;said last weekend in Seattle. &quot;He's got it made in Vegas. Why would he&nbsp;want to leave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if the NCAA assesses a lengthy penalty based on various&nbsp;allegations involving Lloyd Daniels and others?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I . . . still don't see him leaving,&quot; persisted Vaccaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the speculation continues. Within the past few months, he has&nbsp;been rumored reuniting with former Long Beach State athletics director&nbsp;Fred Miller at San Diego State, although that possibility appears moot&nbsp;now that head coach Jim Brandenburg signed a one-year contract extension.&nbsp;Tarkanian's name also has been linked to a pair of the NBA's troubled&nbsp;franchises, the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One current NBA head coach - another friend of Tarkanian's - says&nbsp;that coaching in the NBA &quot;would kill Tark. He could never accept all the&nbsp;losses.&quot; Atlanta Hawks general manager Pete Babcock notes that &quot;coaches&nbsp;who have been very successful, and used to winning 90 percent of games,&nbsp;come into the league and you don't win 90 percent of your games. All of&nbsp;the ex-college coaches I've talked to acknowledge how shocked they are at&nbsp;how different and how demanding the game is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Tarkanian, &quot;He's definitely capable,&quot; continued Babcock.&nbsp;&quot;He's an outstanding coach. If you look at his team, his team concept of&nbsp;defense is so impressive. He does a terrific job. But typically, a new&nbsp;NBA head coach goes to a struggling team. Would he want that?&quot;; Runnin' Rebels trivia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Runnin' Rebels' unblemished 27-0 regular-season record was the&nbsp;first in Division I since Alcorn State and Indiana State in 1979. Larry&nbsp;Bird's Indiana State team went 33-1, the sole defeat was against Magic&nbsp;Johnson's Michigan State club in the NCAA title game. The rest, as they&nbsp;say, is history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- According to the 1990-91 media guide, reserve forward Chris Jeter&nbsp;of Morse High in San Diego was recruited by Georgia and lists his&nbsp;favorite player as the Atlanta Hawks' Cliff Levingston, who was his &quot;Big&nbsp;Brother&quot; during his childhood. Someone forgot to mention that Levingston&nbsp;changed teams in the offseason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Seldom-used guard David Rice made the only start of his career&nbsp;Feb. 23 against UC Irvine - on the annual Seniors Night. While the NBA&nbsp;will not come calling, law schools will. Rice was a Rhodes Scholar&nbsp;finalist with a 3.96 grade point average in business and political&nbsp;science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Besides improving his overall shooting percentage from .553 to&nbsp;.594 this season, Stacey Augmon bettered his 3-point accuracy from .320&nbsp;to .458, further enhancing his prospects as an NBA lottery pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Coach Jerry Tarkanian says that reserve center Elmore Spencer of&nbsp;Atlanta, a former Georgia Bulldog, has always excelled in practice, but&nbsp;struggled in games. &quot;Poor Elmore,&quot; said Tarkanian. &quot;One of these games&nbsp;he's going to play well, though.&quot; He did, being named Player of the Game&nbsp;against Utah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- UNLV was limited to single-digits in offensive rebounding only&nbsp;three times this season, but twice against schools from New Jersey. The&nbsp;Rebels claimed a season-low four offensive rebounds against Princeton and&nbsp;nine against Rutgers. They also were held to five against New Mexico&nbsp;State.</SPAN></P>

Under the plan, foods classified&nbsp;as snacks or candies would no longer be exempt from sales tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan has stirred a backlash from the elderly, minorities,&nbsp;business, labor and other consumers, who formed a coalition called&nbsp;Californians Against Food Taxes. They insist the proposal hits the poor&nbsp;and middle-class the hardest. &quot;The country club spread or lobbyist&nbsp;reception menu of brie, caviar and French bread will be untaxed, but the&nbsp;average person's party of chips, cookies and pretzels will be taxed,&quot;&nbsp;said Brad Sherman, chairman of the Board of Equalization, the agency that&nbsp;collects the sales tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FASHION WAVE I: Don't be surprised if multicolored beanies become&nbsp;red-hot this summer. The fashion trend started in Baltimore and is&nbsp;spreading to other East Coast cities. &quot;Baltimore is the beanie capital of&nbsp;the world,&quot; says Stacy Samuels, a manufacturer of the multicolored prop-&nbsp;caps based in Berkeley, Calif. &quot;I have 35 stores there ordering them. And&nbsp;it's already spreading to Washington and Philadelphia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FASHION WAVE II: There's truly a wave of fashion floating into&nbsp;Astoria, Ore., where beachcombers are recovering hundreds of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sports&nbsp;shoes that were lost in a cargo ship mishap a year ago. The shoes&nbsp;reportedly are fine, after some cleaning up. &quot;The advertising&nbsp;possibilities are obvious,&quot; a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representative said. &quot;Shoes that can&nbsp;float around in the ocean for a year and not come apart at the seams just&nbsp;have to be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA - Sales of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s new cross-training athletic shoe&nbsp;went from zero in 1987 to an estimated $ 400 million this year, and Bo and&nbsp;everybody else know one big reason why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to selling a lot of shoes, the advertising campaign&nbsp;featuring athlete Bo Jackson firmly established the small ad shop of&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy as undoubtedly the hottest agency in Portland, Ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Wieden &amp; Kennedy has taken on another challenge, that of trying&nbsp;to get Subaru of America out of reverse. As a result of its landing the&nbsp;high-profile, high-billing account, Wieden &amp; Kennedy is opening a&nbsp;Philadelphia branch, which, by itself, will rank as one of the city's&nbsp;largest agencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Subaru ads by Wieden &amp; Kennedy are to appear around Labor&nbsp;Day. Both the car company and the agency are mum on the content, but&nbsp;Subaru's director of advertising, Mark Dunn, promises that &quot;they're&nbsp;definitely something completely different&quot; from other auto ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign already is something different in one respect.&nbsp;Virtually all automotive advertising has been done by big Madison Avenue-&nbsp;based agencies. Nine-year-old Wieden &amp; Kennedy, by contrast, had never&nbsp;had a nationwide client until it won the account of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, based in&nbsp;Beaverton, Ore.; Bo knows' brought attention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming success of the &quot;Bo knows&quot; ads brought prosperity&nbsp;and rapid growth to Wieden &amp; Kennedy. For several years, the agency had&nbsp;all it could handle just keeping up with its star account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Subaru went looking for a new agency about three months&nbsp;ago, Wieden &amp; Kennedy felt it was ready for another big account. And&nbsp;Subaru, suffering from losses and shrinking market share, was ready to&nbsp;try something fresh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subaru of America, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., took off in the 1970s&nbsp;with what was then a unique product, an inexpensive four-wheel-drive&nbsp;passenger car. With Subaru all the way was its New York ad agency,&nbsp;Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Subaru went into a skid in the mid-'80s. Other carmakers brought&nbsp;out and elaborated on four-wheel-drive models, and they had other models&nbsp;and better-established corporate identities to lure customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subaru of America began suffering losses and shrinking sales, and,&nbsp;last fall, the parent carmaker back in Japan, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.,&nbsp;took matters into its own hands. It bought the Subaru of America stock&nbsp;that had been publicly held and began direct operation of the subsidiary.; Wanted to be major account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 11, Subaru put its advertising account &quot;into review,&quot;&nbsp;meaning it was up for grabs. Subaru was looking for some specific traits&nbsp;in its agency, said spokesman Richard Marshall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to be a major account but not their sole account,&quot; he&nbsp;said. Nor did Subaru want to be one of many sizable accounts held by an&nbsp;agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy was to find an agency big enough to have the resources&nbsp;to service a national account but small enough that Subaru would command&nbsp;management's undivided attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consultant helped narrow the list to a half-dozen candidates. One&nbsp;by one, they trooped to a meeting room in the Hyatt Cherry Hill to make a&nbsp;presentation for about nine top-ranking Subaru executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Luhr led Wieden &amp; Kennedy's four-hour presentation. Although&nbsp;he can't discuss the creative concepts he pitched, he says that the&nbsp;presentation was built around the idea that &quot;Subaru always has had a&nbsp;distinct personality. It was not a Honda, not a Toyota; it was always&nbsp;styled a little differently.&quot;; Basic, reliable, but dull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subaru has always been thought of as a car that was &quot;basic, Spartan,&nbsp;durable and reliable, but not very pretty to look at,&quot; says Mr. Marshall&nbsp;of Subaru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, that is the theme of Levine, Huntley's last work for Subaru,&nbsp;the &quot;Never Die&quot; commercials that depict latter-day, upscale Subaru&nbsp;drivers discomfited to run across battered but hard-working old Subarus&nbsp;that look as if they are being driven by Okies escaping the Dust Bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads clearly say that Subaru wants a new image. It now falls to&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy to determine what that image will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market for compact and subcompact cars is extremely competitive,&nbsp;with literally dozens of similarly priced and equipped contenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that kind of market, &quot;advertising can really make a difference,&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Luhr says, so Wieden &amp; Kennedy can rightly claim credit if Subaru's&nbsp;fortunes begin to turn around. By the same token, Subaru has placed a&nbsp;great chunk of its fate in the agency's hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wieden &amp; Kennedy promised Subaru that it would open a branch near&nbsp;Cherry Hill to service the account.; Philadelphia office planned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bid the middle of July, Mr. Luhr also plans to staff an office of&nbsp;about 40. Enough people will be brought in from Portland to assure that&nbsp;the new office really is a Wieden &amp; Kennedy site, but the majority are&nbsp;expected to be new hires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia office will be a branch, but one that could grow as&nbsp;large as its home office. The Portland office has about 120 employees and&nbsp;handles $ 250 million in annual billings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Subaru account alone will have 40 employees and up to $ 70&nbsp;million in billings. In Philadelphia, where relatively few agencies&nbsp;handle national accounts, few shops have billings of more than $ 100&nbsp;million from all sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Luhr says the Philadelphia office eventually will look for other&nbsp;accounts, but for about a year or so, it will handle only Subaru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a huge account for us, and we're going to get comfortable&nbsp;with it first,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Americans' exhilaration about communism's collapse is&nbsp;mingled with dismay about facets of their capitalism. Americans are not&nbsp;toppling statues of tycoons - there aren't many - the way Russians are&nbsp;venting their anger against Lenin's statues. But there is anger, about&nbsp;the BCCI and Salomon Brothers scandals, the S&amp;L debacle and soon perhaps&nbsp;about the way some corporate leaders are paying themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compensation of CEOs is often ludicrous in light of corporate&nbsp;performance. Often it is difficult to determine how much CEOs are paid.&nbsp;Compensation packages can be wondrously difficult to decipher. But&nbsp;America's CEOs are paid two to three times more than Japan's or&nbsp;Germany's.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Japan, the compensation of major CEOs is 17 times that of the&nbsp;average worker; in France and Germany, 23-25 times; in Britain, 35 times;&nbsp;in America, between 85 and 100 times. The American CEO/worker disparity&nbsp;doubled during the '80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you appropriately reward individuals' contributions at the&nbsp;pinnacle of complex, sprawling corporations? The slogan &quot;pay for&nbsp;performance&quot; does not take us far. Madonna made $ 25 million last year?&nbsp;Fine. Her pay is directly a function of performances. If Roger Clemens&nbsp;stops winning, his $ 5 million salary will stop. Not so with CEOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO of Eagle Picher Industries got a 38 percent raise while&nbsp;profits were falling 27 percent. Because times are hard for the&nbsp;automobile industry, Ford's CEO took a pay cut last year. But Chrysler's&nbsp;Lee Iacocca took a 25 percent raise - while earnings were falling 17&nbsp;percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Business Week, in 1990 Disney's CEO made more in a day&nbsp;than the average Disney employee made in the year. Is there an economic&nbsp;or moral justification for that, or just a power explanation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Week reports that since 1988 Reebok's CEO has received&nbsp;$ 40.9 million. But $ 100 invested in Reebok stock in 1988 was worth only&nbsp;$ 117 by 1990. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which passed Reebok as leader in the sneaker industry&nbsp;as Reebok profits were growing just 1 percent last year, has a CEO who&nbsp;made a three-year total of $ 1 million in 1988-90 while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> return on&nbsp;equity averaged a robust 23 percent a year. Perhaps Reebok's CEO was&nbsp;worth $ 14.8 million in 1990, but why, precisely? He would have done his&nbsp;job less well for a piddling, oh, $ 7 million? Would the company have done&nbsp;worse with a $ 7 million - or even $ 1 million - replacement? Time may&nbsp;tell: His new contract limits his pay, or at least cash pay, to $ 2&nbsp;million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topping Business Week's annual survey of executive compensation for&nbsp;1990 is United Airlines' CEO. He received $ 18.3 million in salary,&nbsp;bonuses and an incentive plan. United's profits fell 71 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word &quot;incentives&quot; is prominent in CEO compensation packages.&nbsp;Think about that. Incentives to do what, exactly? One's job? One's job&nbsp;well? Or better than one would unless lethargy were conquered by lots of&nbsp;cash? Economists worry that many incentive plans encourage a short-term&nbsp;focus on a few numerical goals, such as stock prices. Those can be&nbsp;floated up by a general market rise unrelated to executive performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress is considering requiring better disclosure of compensation&nbsp;and strengthening stockholders' powers to control it. But stockholder&nbsp;democracy is a weak reed to lean on, at least until large institutional&nbsp;investors get angry and involved. Public anger could provoke at least&nbsp;caution in the clubby corporate culture. And anti-business fever does&nbsp;flare periodically in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fever's causes include resentment of government-conferred wealth&nbsp;(for example, from protective tariffs), fear of monopoly and hugeness&nbsp;(which gave rise to &quot;trust-busting&quot; at the turn of this century), dislike&nbsp;of dependency (such as farmers felt regarding unregulated railroads in&nbsp;the 19th century), disgust with rapaciousness and vulgarity (as in the&nbsp;Gilded Age).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looting of companies by some CEOs could cause another bout of&nbsp;business-bashing.-(c1991.)</SPAN></P>

Ms. Lamarr, 76, was caught&nbsp;leaving a Casselbery drugstore last summer with $ 21.48 worth of laxatives&nbsp;and eye drops. &quot;It just boils down to a case in which prosecution is&nbsp;really not justified,&quot; said Charles Tabscott, an assistant state&nbsp;attorney, who added that Ms. Lamarr had signed a statement agreeing not&nbsp;to violate any law for a year. Ms. Lamarr's lawyer, Joerg Jaeger, said&nbsp;she must shop with a companion because she cannot see well enough to read&nbsp;labels and price tags or to handle money. She said she thought her&nbsp;companion had paid for the items.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

As the legal eagles huddled, Ms. Gabor, 73,&nbsp;sat in a courthouse corridor, reading a copy of the National Enquirer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCAL LEGEND MAKES GOOD: New Orleans rolled out the red carpet&nbsp;Thursday for native son &quot;Fats&quot; Domino, who had dozens of hit songs in the&nbsp;1950s and early '60s. Mr. Domino, who easily lives up to his nickname,&nbsp;says he has never strayed far from his hometown because &quot;I feel bigger in&nbsp;New Orleans.&quot; Mayor Sidney Barthelemy presented him with a proclamation&nbsp;naming Thursday Fats Domino Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STRONG-WILLED: Two sons of the late Miles Davis and all three of his&nbsp;ex-wives were cut out of the jazz trumpeter's will.

The ad shows Mr. Agassi hitting balls around a group of TV sets.&nbsp;One ball hits a set, turning it on, and Ms. Child, 79, is seen peeling an&nbsp;artichoke. Ms. Child says she agreed to do the spot because of a &quot;snafu&nbsp;with my lawyers when the company asked for a clip from one of my shows.&quot;&nbsp;But her royalties will go to the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food, and&nbsp;she's making it clear she doesn't wear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;I wear New Balance,&quot; she&nbsp;said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'THE ARM is a billboard,' drawled Pro Serve's good-natured press officer James Jolly. The Washington-based management company has four of the priciest billboards in tennis; two belong to Gabriela Sabatini and two to Stefan Edberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where better to showcase these admirable advertising hoardings than at Wimbledon, the competition Jolly describes as 'the jewel in the crown of tennis'. Despite the higher prize money of some US tournaments and blanket TV coverage of the French Open, it is still Wimbledon that the key players want to win most and that includes the marketing and management companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only Edberg's shock defeat by Michael Stich in the semi-finals stopped the Pro Serve from 'doing the double' with two Wimbledon finalists. Edberg might have missed out on the big prize at Wimbledon, but his bank balance will not be unduly troubled by the absence of the pounds 240,000 winner's cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edberg was tennis's top earner last year with prize money of pounds 1.2million. Add payments for exhibition matches, the sponsorship deals with Adidas, Wilson, Ebel watches, Fuji and Volvo and the figure approaches the pounds 5million mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sabatini has a similarly impressive number of motifs adorning her person courtesy of Sergio Tacchini (clothes), Seat, Avis, Longines (watches) and in her spare time promotes her eponymous brand of perfume. Sabatini is the marketing man's dream, a feminine, popular and successful tennis star. And answers to journalists' inquiries about her lifestyle read like a brand directory: she has a Walkman, 30 pairs of Ray-Bans, a white Seat, a Longines watch, and she shops at The Gap. Hardly surprising that her pounds 600,000 tennis earnings last year can be computed into a net worth closer to pounds 10million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the marketing coup of the Wimbledon championships was the deal Procter &amp; Gamble struck with 15-year old wunderkind Jennifer Capriati to publicise Oil of Ulay skin cream. Capriati lost to Sabatini in the semi-finals, but the youngster wore her art clearly on her sleeve, albeit with the product's US brand name 'Oil of Olay'. There was no mistaking the brand's pink and black lettering, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capriati's defeat of Navratilova (who has won pounds 9million in prize money during her career) in the quarter-finals was heaven-sent for P&amp;G's marketing. The next day their agency, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, placed press ads in the Evening Standard showing Capriati in full flight, captioned 'Jennifer Capriati always wears white at Wimbledon'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> P&amp;G will not discuss the value of the contract but, combined with a clothing contract from Diadora, Capriati is estimated to pull in pounds 4million from long-term contracts. As long as Capriati does not suffer juvenile burn-out, experts estimate that her earning potential will be around dollars 20million over the next ten years good news for her management company, Mark McCormack's IMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The undisputed king of the sponsorship contract is the colourful Andre Agassi. Sports clothing company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pays the long-haired star around pounds 1million a year for wearing its luminous shirts and eye-catching two-in-one 'liner shorts' a combination of baggy denim shorts and tight black lycra cycling shorts. Before the Wimbledon fortnight, the mere thought of such garish outfits appearing on Centre Court was enough to send the denizens of the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club into a frenzy of indignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No such outrage occurred. The young American appeared in virgin white from head to toe; only the navy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'tick' emblem stood out from the gleaming background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To some, pounds 1million a year for swanking around in two pairs of shorts makes running a water company for pounds 200,000 a year seem like slave labour. But the manufacturers paying for a piece of the Agassi action are convinced they are getting value for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the UK says that the impact of Agassi and John McEnroe's appearances are already increasing sales. 'We have had requests for the shirts they wore, though they are not yet available in the UK. The colourful side of Agassi has been invaluable for us at Wimbledon, and brand awareness has been incredibly high.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot put a number on the players sporting its logo at Wimbledon, as it supplies all players without clothing or shoe contracts with equipment for the tourn- ament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any well-managed player in the top twenty in the world rankings should be turning over millions of dollars, and for any player in the top hundred there is a more than decent living. Mal Washington, who almost pushed Lendl out of Wimbledon, is ranked 60th. In 1990 he earned dollars 150,000, with a similar amount from sponsorships and exhibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agassi is not on Pro Serve's books, but the company shared the general delight at his success. 'The spirit of Agassi is good for tennis and good for sponsors. People will always watch players like Agassi and McEnroe, who is now seen as part of the old guard,' says Jolly. Sponsors will still pay pounds 25,000 per match to have a small patch of the right player, and one German manufacturer sends its scouts to sign up players on the spot if they are playing on a show court or being televised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But sponsors also want to see value for money; players are increasingly asked to participate in 'meet and greet' events run by their paymasters. And while swearing on court is generally good for publicity and profile, overly wayward or immoral behaviour off-court might cost a player a contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But tennis is not the hot property it once was. In the late 1970s, when McEnroe and Borg had their epic, absorbing struggles, sponsors were more eager to buy into the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Golf is now the hottest property sport by quite a long way', says Jolly. The pastel pants brigade has overtaken the tennis court warriors in the marketability stakes, partly because of the lack of personalities in the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'robots' as some unkindly brand them came from a tradition started by Ivan Lendl. Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Jim Courier, and Michael Stich do not have the same crowd-pleasing capacity as McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Vitas Gerulaitis or Ilie Nastase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wimbledon has, however, lost none of its prestige. Despite the British weather, expensive strawberries and infuriating ticket touts, it is still the two weeks of tennis that can make or break a player's career, and bank balance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I WONDERED why Channel 4 screened Lloyd's Of London at 3.55pm on Sunday - curious timing for a documentary about chicanery in the insurance industry. But presumably they wanted something sensational to enliven the pre-Christmas doldrums of celebrity quizzes and old movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its lingering reputation as a bastion of pinstriped Britishness, Lloyd's in fact appears to have been a labyrinth of leather-upholstered corruption into which regulators and current chairman David Coleridge are struggling to insert safeguards and renewed credibility. The posher a chap's voice, the deeper in the mire he probably was.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take Ian Posgate, for example. Afflicted with an inbred accent borrowed equally from Lord St John of Fawsley and Wilfrid Hyde-White, Posgate looks and sounds like an archbishop or a professor of ancient Greek literature, but he was heaved out of Lloyd's for unsportsmanlike aggression and for syphoning money into overseas accounts. Former Lloyd's chairman Sir Peter Green, who resembles one of Harry Enfield's bumbling toffs, was fired in 1987 and fined pounds 33,000 for discreditable conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This sort of thing was so rife it barely seems to have provoked a raised eyebrow. A common trick was for Lloyd's insiders to form 'Baby Syndicates' of perhaps half a dozen members, using their influence and contacts to funnel lucrative business their way. The larger syndicates featuring the much-publicised 'names' were left to shoulder the everyday mass of business and its potential losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The names have been up in arms of late, crying foul because they've been called upon to honour their pledge to cover all losses incurred by their syndicates. Most of them signed up with Lloyd's in the expectation of earning fast, easy money, but now they've been painfully reminded of what 'unlimited liability' means. They've fallen foul of insurance swindles, claims from American workers suffering asbestos-related diseases, and the consequences of Lloyd's decision to diversify into 'catastrophe insurance'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of them claim they were misled and robbed, and find they have to sell their houses and family silver. But as Mary Archer, who runs Lloyd's Hardship Committee, observed, 'I don't feel terribly sorry for rich people who have lost a fair amount of money. It is a bit like gambling on the horses - you may lose.' The question now is whether the rich will decide insurance is no longer worth a flutter and move their money elsewhere. If they do, it's goodnight Lloyd's. After this expose, one might be tempted to add: 'And good riddance.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Trainer Wars (Channel 4) probed behind the flashy and hi-tech facades of the global giants of athletic footwear. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are currently top dogs, with a 30 per cent share of the booming American market, with Reebok hyperventilating along just behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Partly, this was just another story of capitalism red in tooth and claw, to set alongside the Cola and Burger Wars. The days of the humble Dunlop plimsoll or the American canvas baseball boot have been blown away by a blizzard of foot-technology, superstar endorsements, and ruthlessly targeted commercials which make pop videos look like the Test Card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT where the whole lot is beginning to gape at the seams is in the ghettos and inner cities, where sportswear-envy has become the regular flashpoint for drive-by killings and gang wars. Suddenly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - who claim, improbably, that they're primarily in sports and fitness, rather than street fashion - find their crusade for the feet and minds of American teenagers has plunged them into the social chaos of an underworld where the major cause of death for black males aged 15-25 is murder, and where black kids on the streets of Chicago's south side are more at risk than soldiers were in Vietnam. A new category of 'sportswear-related deaths' has been invented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ad on a street-gang theme was banned in the US, but the company argues it can't be blamed for America's social crisis. Yet it has spent millions promoting its goods as the epitome of all-American health, fitness and success, and has built itself into the grassroots of college and high-school sport, funding summer camps and providing free merchandise to cash-starved campuses. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has created role-models to aspire to and status symbols to acquire. People kill for them in the States, but they could buy them for Dollars 8 a pair in the markets in South Korea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I HAVE been reading shoeboxes. Usually I prefer books but a particular shoebox caught my attention. I have been ill since last week and, once I'd let off some bile against the Royal Family, also bored. So I cleared out the cupboard and that's when I found the box. It had once contained a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Pegasus trainers, bought at some expense to protect my knees whilst my feet pound the streets and parks of north London. Since the purchase, a week of snow and a week of 'flu had protected my knees very well so I hadn't got much use out of the trainers. The box proved excellent value for money though.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emblazoned on it, along with a lot of other stuff, was the legend 'Just Do It'. Just do what? These three little words, along with their close cousin 'Go For It', are responsible for a great deal of confusion among us New Men as we jog through this vale of tears. I have never known what I am supposed to be just doing and going for. I wish I could find out, because I think I'd be a lot happier and more successful. I suppose it has something to do with either spending money or becoming a health fascist, both of which I try to avoid. It may have something to do with getting a proper job. I hope not. Perhaps someone at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can help me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> STILL perplexed, I answered the telephone. It's a new telephone, equipped with a squawk-box facility. Very posh. The caller's voice comes out of a loudspeaker and I can reply without picking up the receiver. But technology usually lets you down. The squawk-box doesn't work. My half of any conversation sounds like it's coming from the bottom of a mineshaft. The call was from my friend Marc. 'Hello Marc,' I said, feeling high-powered. 'Pick the phone up, Robert' he said, having met my squawk-box before. So I did. He offered me a lift to Sainsburys to do the shopping. What could New Man do but accept, much as I didn't want to go?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm glad I did go, because I met Michael Ignatieff Late Show presenter, Observer columnist and recently published novelist. Well, I didn't exactly meet him, more saw him from a distance disappearing down the first aisle (tins, tea and coffee). 'That's Michael Ignatieff,' I said to Marc, trying to sound off-hand. 'You're right,' said Marc, who was genuinely off-hand, probably because he lives with someone much more famous than Michael Ignatieff and prats like me in supermarkets are a constant source of harassment. But there's something about famous people, isn't there? Heedless of my fevered state, I dashed, trolley suspiciously empty, along the second aisle (biscuits and condiments) in order to come back up the first and catch Ignatieff full frontal. I persuaded myself that I wanted to ask him about that weekend's column but was really seized by an irrational desire to see what he had in his trolley. Would he have bought the own-brand soups, the Baxter 69p a tin range or the ultra-posh New Covent Garden Soup Co variety?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I never found out. Ignatieff, well disciplined Renaissance New Man, obviously an older hand at the Sainsburys game than I, was too quick for me. In my </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Pegasus trainers, maybe I would have caught him. As it was, he was away to the delicatessen before I turned the corner. Too embarrassed to follow him further, instead I had an argument at the bakery over the custard tart I was buying for the little snack 'Er Outdoors likes when she gets in from her proper job. Such are the travails of New Men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPEAKING of new men, we had an unlikely recruit to our ranks last week. Up until Friday, I had thought Justin Fashanu was the bravest man in football for revealing he was gay on the front page of the Sun. Anyone who has witnessed the machismo of a football team's dressing room will appreciate that this was a very courageous thing to do. Now his bravery has been equalled by Kenny Dalglish, who came out in a different way when he resigned as manager of Liverpool FC. Dalglish rejected the value system of the world he has been steeped in since signing on for Celtic at the age of 16. For 20-odd years, Dalglish has been Going For It and Just Doing It with incomparable skill. Now it seems maybe even King Kenny didn't know what it was all for either. I hope he finds out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A question in the admirable Junior Gunners section of Arsenal's match programme last Saturday: name at least eight towns in England which have more than two football teams. I know only seven. A copy of the Guardian's Year In Sport to any reader who can go one better.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L.A. Gear Inc. is gearing up to introduce a line of shoes intended to catapult the company into the ranks of performance-sneaker leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-tech line, called Catapult, features an ''anti-fatigue rebound system'' designed to give the wearer added lift for jumping higher.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teaser TV ads now airing - by the BBDO Los Angeles agency - call Catapult The Machine. They urge viewers to watch the shoe's launch in an ad to run during Super Bowl XXV on Sunday.<BR>Starring in the launch ad: Karl Malone, power forward for the Utah Jazz basketball team. It ends with a slogan referring to rival shoes as hot air - a dig at sneaker giant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s best-selling Air line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's directed at certain people, obviously,'' says Sandy Saemann, exec VP of L.A. Gear. Coincidentally, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also will run a Super Bowl ad to launch a shoe, -the Air 180.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear became the USA's No. 3 sneakers firm, behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok International Ltd., by marketing fashion-oriented shoes that women loved. But the market turned more performance-oriented, -leaving L.A. Gear at a disadvantage. L.A. Gear surprised Wall Street on Monday with a fourth-quarter loss from selling leftover shoes at reduced prices. The stock fell 2 7/8 Monday, then dropped 1 Tuesday to $ 9 1/2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Catapult, L.A. Gear will have feet in both markets. ''Why can't shoe companies be both?'' Saemann says. ''Ford makes the Explorer, a slick little muscle truck for young men, and makes the Thunderbird for young women.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catapult will make its debut in a basketball version. Scheduled to follow this year: versions for sports such as tennis, running and cross-training.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An ad for Diet Pepsi that sent viewers around the world was the world- beater in USA TODAY's Ad Meter survey of Super Bowl commercials.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The bubbly soft-drink ad topped the list of 46 Super Sunday ads watched and rated by 55 residents of Arlington, Va., for the third annual Ad Meter. Like many of the other high-scoring ads, Diet Pepsi's 60-second spot rewarded viewers with large doses of star power (singer Ray Charles), humor (monks chanting an ad jingle) and warmth (a singing cowboy and a church choir).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When it started, I thought, 'Here we go again. I've seen this before.' But they were just building up to it,'' said Kerry Tymchuk, 32, a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the gulf war had any impact on the Ad Meter audience, it's not evident from the results. The highest ranked ad taking the crisis into account - a Diet Coke ad announcing a $ 1 million donation to the USO - came in ninth. Indeed, the cola warriors took different stances on the war (Story, 1B) - and their Ad Meter showings differ dramatically as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi-Cola Co. aired its original ads but canceled its contest. Coca-Cola USA yanked its original funny ads for serious ones but went ahead with its contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad Meter viewers preferred Pepsi's approach. Of the top four ads, three were Diet Pepsi ads - all the ads that Diet Pepsi ran. And while Diet Coke's USO ad finished ninth, a second ad - to play the ''Crack the code for real refreshment'' game - tied for 22nd. (However, the Ad Meter audience did not have the game pieces for the Coke game.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ads rating high were stuffed with sure-fire crowd pleasers, such as celebrities, laughs and good feelings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A McDonald's Corp. ad spotlighting Mike Sewell, a 19-year-old with Down's Syndrome who works for the fast-food giant in Cary, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It tugs at your heart,'' said Gwenda Ayres, 34, an accountant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Two ads for Panasonic that humanized electronics products by showing a small-town parade and youngsters fumbling their way through a peewee football game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A warm, low-key ad for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. that saluted the shoe firm's famous athletes. The 90-second ad, launching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air 180 line, displayed giant images of Bo Jackson, Michael Jackson and other superstars at play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showing was good for 10th place. The company was the Ad Meter winner in 1990 with a wildly funny spoof of sports and sportscasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other end of the Ad Meter spectrum was Bud Bowl 3. The third annual mega-promotion from Anheuser-Busch Inc. - matching bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light beer in a mock football game - was more a Dud Bowl than a Bud Bowl to Ad Meter viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of six Bud Bowl ads during the game, three landed with a thud among the Ad Meter's bottom four. The highest rated was the Bud Bowl's finale - in which Bud Light won its first Bud Bowl, 23-21. That was 34th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They're not just silly, they're stupid,'' said Mike Drillings, 45, a psychologist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ad Meter audience was randomly selected. While such groups are frequently used for national marketing surveys, the small size (55 people) means the results don't necessarily represent the opinions of all U.S. consumers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How many times Monday did you turn to a co-worker, a classmate or your significant other and say, ''Uh-huh''? Every time, it was the sweetest sound for Pepsi this side of a pop-top popping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ''U'' word could become the latest word in ad catch phrases thanks to the super performance of Pepsi-Cola Co.'s Super Bowl ads Sunday. All three of the Diet Pepsi ads that aired during Super Bowl XXV - featuring Ray Charles warbling the soda's new jingle, ''You've Got the Right One, Baby, Uh-huh!'' - finished in the top four slots of USA TODAY's Ad Meter survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a surprise ending to what has become the biggest day of the year for megamarketers as well as football players. The Monday-morning quarterbacking along Madison Avenue was as intense as it was among fans replaying the New York Giants' exciting 20-19 win over the Buffalo Bills. (Endorsements, 1C.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sobering reality of a wartime Super Bowl had sent Pepsi, Coca-Cola USA and other advertisers scrambling to make last-minute changes in long-settled Super Sunday game plans. But to the Ad Meter audience at least, those advertisers who decided on business as usual - presenting typical Super Bowl ads heavy on humor, novelty, star power and tugs at the heartstrings - wound up big winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For USA TODAY's third annual pulse taking of typical U.S. TV viewers, 55 residents of Arlington, Va., rated 46 ads that they watched during the game. Panelists were randomly selected, and they didn't necessarily represent the opinions of all U.S. consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glitzy Diet Pepsi ads- - blew away not only rival Diet Coke but almost every other firm shelling out a record $ 800,000 for 30 seconds of ad time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uh-huh!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi's showing turned a gutsy gamble into marketing magic. Late last week, Pepsi decided to call off a heavily promoted Super Bowl call-in contest. Though the game was scrapped, Pepsi pressed on with its larger-than- life Diet Pepsi pitches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archrival Coke opted to yank its yuk-yuk Diet Coke ads in favor of serious, sober messages that told viewers that light-hearted ads were inappropriate given the gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coke apparently misjudged the national mood , if the Ad Meter audience was any indication. ''It seemed like (Coke was) taking</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coke's message ''sounds a little like moralizing, disapproving of anyone having a good time,'' says Judith Langer, head of the Langer Associates market-research consultancy. The fact that the Super Bowl ''went on was saying we wanted to keep America going as usual and we wanted to have fun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langer had a warning for advertisers who like Coke are thinking of creating war-themed ads: The public is ''wary of marketers climbing on any bandwagon, whether it's green (environmental marketing) or pro-war.'' Those who want to pitch patriotically ought to run such ads during war coverage instead of during a festive Super Bowl, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ads that said hooray for the USA - in a more low-key way - fared better with the Ad Meter viewers. Of five ads run by Panasonic Co., two that spotlighted small-town consumers and their kids ranked fifth and sixth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Patriotic feelings seemed to be running high,'' said Bob Greenberg, Panasonic's communications general manager. But he noted that Panasonic created the ads before the war began. Like the electronics marketer's other Super Sunday ads, the spots have been airing since October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panasonic isn't the only advertiser who chose to air previously run spots. Among others: Anheuser-Busch Inc., which aired a patriotic ''Here's to you, America'' ad from the late 1980s, and Master Lock, which ran a torture- test ad it aired during Super Bowl XXIV a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Anheuser, ''our feeling is not so much, 'Is it new vs. is it old?' but, 'How strong is it? How compelling is it?' '' says Tom Sharbaugh, vice president of Budweiser brands. That's why the beer giant mixed ads of varying ages: the older ''Here's to you'' ad, a current ''Nothing beats a Bud'' ad and the new Bud Bowl 3 ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling ads is one way to keep down the cost of participating in the Super Bowl, especially as the cost of a 30-second ad keeps soaring: Sunday's $ 800,000 price tag was up a whopping 14.5% from the $ 700,000 charged last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, most marketing titans see the Super Bowl as a showcase that demands the unveiling of blockbuster commercials. Of the 10 ads liked best by the Ad Meter audience, seven made their debuts Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are two games that go on. One is in the Super Bowl. The other is in the advertising,'' says David Novak, executive vice president of marketing and sales for Pepsi. Other advertisers who aired all-new ads included Audi of America Inc. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other key ad issues on the post-game agenda:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Exclusivity. Some companies are the only ones in their categories to advertise during the game. Anheuser, for instance, is the exclusive beer advertiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi, by contrast, prefers to confront its cola-wars opponent within the game. ''We welcome the competition,'' Novak says. ''We believe we always have a great opportunity whenever we go head-to-head with Coca-Cola.'' Indeed, the three Diet Pepsi ads averaged 8.14 with the Ad Meter viewers, vs.  6.68 for Diet Coke's two ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And L.A. Gear Inc. - another first-time Super Sunday advertiser - was glad that the sneaker wars raged during the game. The No. 3 sneaker firm faced No. 1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - each ran one ad - and No. 2 Reebok International Ltd., which ran two ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think (viewers) can sort it out by the creativity of the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Timing.  Last year, the Super Bowl was a blowout by the fourth quarter - meaning marketers whose ads aired then ran the risk of having viewers tune out. So after Super Bowl XXIV ended, second-half advertisers such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reserved ad time for the first half of Super Bowl XXV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprise! Sunday's game was close until the final seconds. But just eight ads appeared during the fourth quarter - vs.  11 in the first, 18 in the second and nine in the third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Having the Bud Bowl conclude in the fourth quarter is quite important to us,'' said Sharbaugh, referring to the mock football game between Budweiser and Bud Light. ''Certainly we're happiest when we have viewership continue through the game, (but) we tend not to worry too much about the vagaries of quarterly ups and downs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ratings. Recent Super Bowls have drawn disappointing Nielsen ratings. Sunday's game averaged a 42.9 overnight rating in 25 cities - meaning 42.9% of all TV households watching television at the time were tuned into the game. (TV Sports, 3C.) If nationwide ratings, due today, are comparable, they would be up 10% from last year's low-rated</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skater Katarina Witt, a product of the East German communist sports machine, made her debut as a product promoter Thursday at Atlanta's Super Show, a sports gear trade show that is expected to draw 85,000 visitors in four days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's so big,'' said Danskin's latest ''activewear'' endorser, ''I just want to go shopping.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the spirit. More than 2,000 exhibits covered about 1.6 million square feet, where more than $ 1 billion in wholesale gear will be sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparent king of the endorsers on hand: L.A. Gear's Joe Montana, who caused a scene normally seen only around shopping-center Santas. Said Love Hewitt, 12, who has appeared in 30 commercials, a TV show, has two record deals and was dancing in a sneaker promotion: ''I just hope to get a picture with Joe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montana reminisced about his 1991 Super Bowl: ''I watched the beginning, then went to the beach and had a few mai-tais.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> artsy exhibit, plenty of deals were cut around a robotic camera filming closeups of shoes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rob Strasser predicts the future of feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strasser and partner Peter Moore helped create </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air lines. Now Strasser lives in Herzogenaurach, Germany, as a marketing vice president for adidas. Together with Moore, working in the pair's Portland, Ore., marketing firm, Strasser says he's working to change adidas' image as a ''famous-but-boring brand.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about time. Although Adi Dassler made his first gym shoe in 1920, adidas had a puny 4% share of the U.S. market last year - compared with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 28% and Reebok's 21%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While those giants tweak each other with mild wisecracks in TV ads, Strasser helped create a new adidas Equipment brand that will be rolled out nationally by August with a back-to-basics pitch. One Equipment ad, for instance, says sports isn't about ''greed ... arrogance (or) fashion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pitch meant to attract baby boomers, many of whom are presumably becoming more sensible at the expense of their fashion sense. The shoemaker will rely on relatively low-key endorsers such as marathoner Grete Waitz. Laughs Strasser: ''The baby boomers are going to set the trends until the last one is dead.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another underdog, Converse, is relying on a practical pitch: It has launched a new ad campaign with the tagline ''It's What's Inside that Counts''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last night, adidas and Converse managed to score a conventional marketing coup in their uphill battle against the U.S. sneaker giants. Duke's basketball team wore adidas, Kansas wore Converse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHEST MATCH: Sam Marion recalls it as ''a hell of an experience.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 15 years ago, a player on a Little League team Marion managed was hit in the chest - and nearly died being rushed to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion didn't forget. After borrowing heavily, Marion's International Protective Athletic Safety Corp. of Fraser, Mich., developed a $ 70 kids' safety vest suitable for baseball and other sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion's safety vest weighs 1.5 pounds and is made of compressed foam. They're available in about 50 stores so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're overdue. The Consumer Products Safety Commission reports 51 baseball-related deaths between 1974 and 1984, and at least 13 in 1989-90. Last Saturday, a 15-year-old New Hampshire hockey player died after being hit with a puck in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion says he also has sold the Seattle Mariners on using his $ 80 adult safety jacket in practice. ''It won't be long,'' says ex-major leaguer Lary Sorensen, ''until you see most pro clubs using them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLOW OUT: Smokefree Educational Services, a health advocacy group, says it will include Little Leaguers as protesters in an opening day demonstration Monday against the Marlboro billboard in New York's Shea Stadium. The group is offering to pay the New York Mets to replace the cigarette marketer. ... Saying it wants to export U.S. traditions, the World League of American Football is starting a month-long scratch-off promotion sponsored by Kentucky Fried Chicken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Men's water polo was the first team sport in the Olympic Games. Now, women's water polo hopes to become the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FINA women's water polo World Cup, an eight-nation tournament, continues through Sunday in Long Beach, Calif.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials are using the event to showcase the sport and boost their campaign to get women's water polo on the schedule of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Women have been playing the sport internationally in Europe since 1928, and it's now being played in 35 countries on five continents,'' said former national team player Theresa Breckon, vice president for women with U.S. Water Polo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We feel we have all the requirements necessary to be an Olympic sport. We already have a network of delegates, doctors and officials, because of the men's sport. We would just be adding an event rather than adding a whole new sport.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breckon said Robert Helmick and Anita DeFrantz, the USA's International Olympic Committee members, have expressed support. The only previous Olympic exposure for women's water polo was at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, when the USA and the Netherlands played an exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's water polo is played at about 35 U.S. universities, whose teams supply most of the national team players. In January, the U.S. team was third at the World Championships.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> UNIFORM CHANGE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken over from Italian manufacturer Kappa as official uniform supplier of U.S. track and field teams, effective Monday. Kappa had a multiyear deal with The Athletics Congress, the U.S. federation, that was voided by missed payments. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract is for 10 years, but its fee to TAC was not disclosed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> GAMES BEGIN: About 3,500 athletes from 18 Mediterranean countries will participate in the Mediterranean Games, starting Friday in Athens. ... Husky Oil Ltd. and Molson Breweries are withdrawing sponsorship from the Canadian national ski teams and World Cup events.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Contributing: Dick Patrick</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fabulous five are already fixtures on college coaches' most-wanted lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 6-9 center Othella Harrington of Jackson (Miss.) Murrah, the camp's second-leading rebounder (5.9 a game) and fourth-best field-goal shooter (55.8%). Averages are lower because campers played only half of each game.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 6-7 small forward Corliss Williamson of Russellville (Ark.) High, the No. 9 scorer (8.9 ppg).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 7-foot center Rashard Griffith of Chicago King, the No. 6 rebounder (4.9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 6-7 swingman Rodrick Rhodes of Jersey City St. Anthony, who was not among statistical leaders but helped St. Anthony to a No. 2 ranking in USA TODAY's final Super 25 poll last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 6-4 guard Jason Kidd of Alameda (Calif.) St. Joseph Academy, who was second in steals (2.5) and third in assists (3.6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scouts did add one new name to high school basketball's social register: Damon Flint, a previously unheralded guard from Cincinnati Woodward. Flint, a 6-4 junior, ranked seventh in scoring (9.3) and fourth in three-point shooting (43.8%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIGNED: Shawn Estes, a second team All-USA TODAY baseball player from Minden (Nev.) Douglas High, signed with the Seattle Mariners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estes, 18, was Seattle's No. 1 draft pick and the 11th player chosen overall in the June draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estes, a left-hander, went 8-2 with a 0.80 ERA.  He struck out 141 in 62 innings and allowed only 15 hits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seattle Times reported that Estes received a $ 400,000 salary package. Included is his college education paid for by the Mariners.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> JUNIOR BOWLERS: Youths from the USA, Puerto Rico, six Canadian provinces, the Far East, European and Caribbean military commands, compete in the National Junior Bowling Championships July 17-21 at Woodland Bowl in Indianapolis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So much for the romance of the road. A new ad campaign for Subaru takes a determinedly realistic, if wry, approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can drive it so fast you'll get so many tickets you'll lose your license,'' warns a magazine ad for the SVX sports coupe. Of course, doing so is ''stupid, dangerous and a waste of precious fossil fuels...  Not to mention the type of person you meet in prison.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is post-'80 s advertising: pushing reliability and value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A car is a car,'' says the narrator in ads showing Subaru's assembly line in Lafayette, Ind. ''It won't make you look handsome or prettier or younger, and if it improves your standing with the neighbors, then you live among snobs with distorted values.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are the first for Subaru by its new agency, Portland, Ore.-based Wieden &amp; Kennedy. Subaru's $ 60 million account is the first auto client for the agency, now known mainly for its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. campaigns - ''Just do it'' and ''Bo knows.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the agency's only other large client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads keep Subaru's ''idiosyncratic'' appeal, but are aimed at buyers made value-conscious by a white-collar recession. ''It was not really a repositioning but saying, 'Your time has come,' '' says agency head Dan Wieden. Subaru even got its own </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-like tag line: ''Subaru. What to drive.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L.A. Gear has picked a former Reebok executive to pump up its profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark R. Goldston will join the Los Angeles-based sneaker maker Oct. 7 as president and chief operating officer, a new position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldston has spent the past two years as a principal of Odyssey Partners, a leveraged-buyout and investment firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that, he was chief marketing officer of Reebok International, spearheading the company's marketing effort for its successful sneaker The Pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldston has written a book, The Turnaround Prescription, describing how to create a corporate marketing turnaround. It is expected to be published next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnaround theme could come in handy at L.A. Gear, which is struggling to turn around its finances. Under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, L.A. Gear restated its second-quarter performance from a $ 258,000 gain to a $ 4 million loss. The SEC objected to L.A. Gear's inclusion of one- time credits in its earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help improve its finances, L.A. Gear received $ 100 million in fresh capital earlier this month from Roy Disney's Trefoil Capital Investors. In return, it upped Trefoil's stake to 35%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldston's appointment is one in a series of management changes made since the Trefoil agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janet Mangano, retail analyst for Johnson Redbook Service, says the company's finances should be the new president's first priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are still No. 3 behind Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and both Reebok and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are financially fit,'' she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had 30% of the U.S. market last year. Reebok had 23%. L.A. Gear had 13%, but analysts are predicting that will drop to 10% this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers. He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of sky surfing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing. The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short. Play Hard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the No. 2 spot and overtake its rival, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sky-surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that debuted on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York. The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology. The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that, for a variety of reasons, fell short of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ubiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon. As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on. Reebok also was caught last year in a controversy with a campaign that depicted bungee jumping, an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Reebok has been labeled a revolving-door client by ad agencies. The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bunjee jumping ad. Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day. Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past. But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reebok has been like a teen-ager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign. &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things. Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and advertising executives say it will be months before there are clear signs whether the campaign will create a new high- water mark for athletic shoe ads. But most reacted positively to Reebok's approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen the line and I like it. In the context of sports, and of trying to have the maximum performance, I think it works,&quot; said Joe Grimaldi, chief operating officer of Mullen Advertising Inc. of Wenham, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several wondered privately whether Reebok's new theme is more attuned to the go-go 1980s than the presumably more laid-back 1990s. But the consensus was that it would appeal to the active and would-be athletes Reebok is trying to reach, especially if the company doesn't put the campaign on the shelf too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't be too literal about the line. It could do for them what 'Just Do It' does for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It's a call to action, an invitation to get out there and play some sports,&quot; said Ron Lawner, chairman and creative director at the Lawner Reingold Britton agency in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems they are introducing a campaign idea that they are going to stay with, and I think that's even more important than the campaign itself,&quot; said Steve Encarnacao, Reebok's chief marketing officer from 1985-87, and now chief executive of Stonemark Inc., which produces Carter's children shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encarnacao suggested the new campaign harks back to an early, successful effort by Reebok, entitled &quot;Because Life Is Not a Spectator Sport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Stingers face powerhouse Manitoba in the first round of the 20th Concordia </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Classic women's basketball tournament this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we're going to bring our program back to the level it once was, we have to play teams like Manitoba,&quot; Concordia coach Mike Hickey said. &quot;It doesn't do any good to play against weak teams just for the sake of winning.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concordia lost by 23 points to Manitoba's high-powered offence in non-conference action last month that was part of the Bisons' October feed of Quebec teams as they beat McGill, Bishop's and Concordia on successive days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stingers play Manitoba in the last of four opening-round games tomorrow at 8 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll probably be at our strongest for the first time this season,&quot; said Hickey, whose team has won only once in seven pre- season games. &quot;We have good quickness, so it will be our speed against their size.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day Classic, which starts tomorrow at Loyola Gym, has developed into one of the premier tournaments in the country and will be closely watched to help decide the first weekly top-10 national ranking of the season, which the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union will release Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Laurentian Vees, CIAU national champion for the last two years, are favored to win the Classic for the third straight year, despite losing national team player Nana Robinson, a guard who has taken the year off from school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Completing the eight-team field are the McGill Martlets and Queen's Golden Gaels, who meet in the opening game at 2 p.m., the Winnipeg Lady Wesmen and Ottawa Gee-Gees, who play at 4 p.m., and Laurentian and Waterloo Athenas at 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concordia is a team - make that a progam - in transition, with a new coach, some new faces and emerging from a controversy and legacy of ineptitude that Hickey hopes is behind the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickey replaced Louisa Zerbe as head coach after last season when Zerbe resigned before the season ended over what she said was a lack of support from the Concordia athletic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concordia finished last in the four-team Quebec University Women's Basketball League with a 1-11 record and missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zerbe compiled a 5-37 league record during her four years as head coach. On Feb. 3, 1990, Concordia ended a five-year, 0-47 losing streak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's Hickey's second time as head coach of the Stingers. He coached the women's team from 1976 to 1985, during which Concordia reached the CIAU national tournament four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his return, Hickey said his first priorities were to make the women's program &quot;enjoyable again&quot; and Concordia the class of the Quebec league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appears to have succeeded on the first matter, but returning Concordia to its previous glory days might take longer than anticipated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shoes are responsible for the majority of foot deformities and problems that physicians encounter in women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the main finding of a U.S. survey by a group of orthopedic surgeons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a real problem; shoe wear has its impacts on women's feet,&quot; says Seattle's Dr. John E. McDermott, incoming president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, the study's sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also a problem that results in women being by far the majority of patients visiting orthopedists with foot complaints, McDermott says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 80 per cent of the study's 356 women reported foot pain. Count their agonies: bunions, hammertoes, pinched nerves, corns and calluses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And all this from individuals, ages 20-60, who reported no previous foot trauma or surgery and no medical conditions that may affect foot health, like arthritis or diabetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's always been a lot of suspicions and accusations that women's footwear causes a lot of problems, but there were no studies to back up those accusations,&quot; says the report's primary author, Dr. Carol Frey, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study found enough blame to go around, spreading it among shoe manufacturers, retailers, and omen themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To begin with, when doctors measured the subjects' feet, they found 88 per cent were wearing shoes too small. But the problem wasn't in the length so much as the width. While the average woman in the study said she was an 8B, in fact she was an 8C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crunch comes when women try to find dress shoes that fit their heel snugly but leave room for their toes. Although most women have narrow heels, manufacturers commonly give wide shoes wide heels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a shoe to give support or help, it has to give you heel control,&quot; McDermott says. To get this, many women buy shoes too tight across the base of their toes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, shoe manufacturers commonly buy their dress-shoe lasts - the form upon which the shoe is modeled - in Asia, where women have narrower feet. The result is a slender shoe, which manufacturers believe U.S. women find more appealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Style also conspires to cause problems. Is there a woman alive who hasn't painfully regretted buying a pair of cruel shoes, those high-heeled killers that thrust her weight into pointed toes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoe should be longest at the great toe - not in the center of the shoe,&quot; McDermott says. &quot;That's one of the big problems of design. The big toe is pushed over toward the other toes by the shape of the shoe, and you end up with a deformed foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commonly the damage is done gradually, over years and sometimes painlessly, resulting in a bunion at the base of the big toe, a misshapen big toe, and smaller toes that have clawed under and developed calluses on top. These are called hammertoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the study, women come in for their share of the blame. Although 60 per cent believed their shoe size had increased since age 20, some 75 per cent had not had their feet professionally measured in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the women were right about the increase. The doctors found that by age 29, 18 per cent had larger feet. By age 50, 69 per cent had experienced an increase. And by 60, some 95 per cent had larger feet than when they were 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women's feet can go up about a size to a size and a half as they age,&quot; McDermott says. s, it takes about seven years for a manufacturer to make significant changes in shoe fit. Still, Frey says some companies already are realizing the need and trying to fill it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She gives kudos to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Easy Spirit, Rockport, New Balance, Naturalizer, and Soft Spots, among others, for trying to make fashionable, well-fitting shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oregon's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in particular, recently bought Cole-Haan, a fashion manufacturer. For several months, Cole-Haan has been selling women's pumps bearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air-Sole technology, says John Barbour, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> product line manager. This gives the wearer &quot;a springier sensation under her foot. It helps absorb shock over the life of the shoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just going to be the first wave, moving out into comfort footwear,&quot; Barbour predicts. &quot;We feel as this (baby-boom) customer matures, she'll start elevating fit and comfort to the level of style.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers. He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of &quot;sky surfing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing. The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short. Play Hard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the No. 2 spot and overtake its rival, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sky surfing ad, a 60-second commercial introduced on &quot;Monday Night Football,&quot; is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York. The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology. The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that for a variety of reasons fell short of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ubiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon. As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on. Reebok also last year was caught in a controversy with a campaign that depicted &quot;bungee jumping,&quot; an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Reebok has been labelled a &quot;revolving door&quot; client by ad agencies. The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bungee jumping ad. Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day. Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past. But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reebok has been like a teen-ager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign. &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things. Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First-time participants who weren't sure what to expect yesterday in the 15th annual Ed Barron Hangover Classic run probably got a good clue as they lined up for the start of the eight-kilometer run around the Reflecting Pool on the Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcer advised runners who were &quot;pushing a baby carriage or with a dog, or other, I hate to say it, hindrances,&quot; to please run off to the side so as not to impede unencumbered runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a glorious crisp, sunny New Year's afternoon, 1,328 men, women and children, and several dogs on leashes and babies in strollers, participated in the run, a fund-raiser for the American Cancer Society sponsored by the Potomac Valley Seniors Track Club. The race was expected to yield a $ 1,300 donation, organizers said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual exercise in healthy irreverence is held in honor of former club member Ed Barron, who died of cancer 11 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Darman, who has organized several races in Washington, including the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's Challenge and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capital Challenge, said the Hangover Classic is more about fun than serious racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more of a celebration race,&quot; Darman said. &quot;A higher proportion of people are out there to celebrate the New Year, not so much to run their personal best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While serious runners participate yearly in the Hangover event, it is more informal than many other Washington races, with many runners competing in costumes or forming &quot;centipede&quot; teams in which they run the course linked by ropes or chains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of its relatively short distance -- the Marine Corps Marathon is 26.2 miles, for instance -- it is one of the more accessible of Washington's better-known races. In addition, it is not as competitive to enter as some other well known races, such as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cherry Blossom 10-mile road race, which each April draws an international field of top runners and an overflow of applicants for 5,000 coveted slots. The Marine Corps Marathon drew 13,000 runners last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hangover route started at the Lincoln Memorial playing fields on the west side of the Reflecting Pool, went past the memorial and through the park along Independence Avenue and back to the Reflecting Pool. The course consisted of two laps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The field of participants included grim-faced serious runners, occasional joggers and a few people whose pained expressions suggested they may not be back for the 16th annual classic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though it was not necessary to be suffering a hangover to compete, a number of participants said they did feel the effects of the previous night's reverie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh man, that's not easy to do after you've been out 'til 3 in the morning,&quot; said D.C. physician Paul Rudolf, moments after completing the 4.97-mile run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regina Powell, of Bowie, had other worries after completing the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want my mommy,&quot; the 8-year-old said after finishing in about 39 minutes, well ahead of many adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regina, who has a running trainer, said she liked the race &quot;a little bit.&quot; Her favorite part? &quot;Going around the pond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event kicked off with a costume contest, judged by crowd applause, in which dressing suitable to one's gender appeared to be a disadvantage. The winner in the women's category, Becky Bosley, of Falls Church, sported a Fidel Castro mask and military uniform, while the men's winner wore a black dress, black fishnet stockings, silver-colored beads and running shoes that matched neither the dress nor each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to a costume shop for the outfit, though the shoes are mine,&quot; said Warren Snaider, of the District, the men's costume winner. Snaider beat out a man dressed in a waiter's outfit who sported a tray with drinks and offered to quench the thirst of anyone who applauded for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the race, Lynn Patterson, of Fairfax, was the first woman to finish, with a time of 28:28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race was one of the closest ever, with Michael Regan, of the District, edging Trevor Nelson, of Berkeley, Calif., by two seconds. Regan's time was 24:43.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regan said he entered the Hangover because &quot;it seemed like a fun way to start the New Year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson, who was in town visiting friends, had another motive. &quot;My girlfriend's dad is running, so I figured I'd look good for him,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Shaffer left a comfortable job with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> company in 1985 to start a new business here in partnership with a sleepy Chinese concern called the Long March Leather Shoe Factory. What happened over the next few years illustrates why industrial output in this region in southern China is now soaring at more than 25 percent per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaffer said he began his joint venture here by insisting on modern, capitalist management techniques and &quot;breaking bad habits&quot; among the Chinese workers, such as sleeping on the job. After just three months, productivity had quadrupled, to about six pairs of shoes per day for each employee from Long March's old level of 1.5 pairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the decade, Shaffer had expanded his operations to three factories here, and was making up to 650,000 pairs of shoes a month for such U.S. companies as Timberland, Thom McAn and Stride Rite -- and for his old employer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His sales in 1990 totaled $ 74 million. Asked about profits, Shaffer just smiled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to Guangdong Province, the freewheeling, free-market area along China's southern coast that, by local estimates, is currently among the fastest-growing economic regions in the world. A banner in the center of its capital, Guangzhou -- formerly known as Canton -- proclaims in big characters: &quot;Unity, Progress, Friendship.&quot; But a better slogan for the new Guangdong might be: &quot;Money, Money, Money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guangdong's real industrial output grew during the 1980s at an average annual rate of 19.7 percent, which analysts here said was by far the fastest of any province in China. The growth rate jumped from that already high level during the past 12 months, to 27.7 percent. The province's savings rate last year was a stupendous 32.8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This booming area won't be on the itinerary of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrives in Beijing Friday to meet with China's hard-line Communist Party leaders. So Baker won't see the economic whirlwind that, in the view of many experts, is transforming southern China despite Beijing's efforts to contain it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic reforms were launched here in the late 1970s, when Guangdong was permitted to go &quot;one step ahead&quot; of the rest of China in experimenting with free-market reforms. At first, foreign investment was largely limited to three special zones along the coast -- Shantou, Shenzen and Zhuhai -- but it has spread to most of the province. In the years since, Guangdong's economy has been moving outside the supervision or control of the Communist central government in Beijing. Last year, for example, just 3 percent of the province's total investment came out of the national budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to several Westerners here, there are signs that the region may also be moving beyond Beijing's political control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of Guangdong's growing political independence, analysts here point to the battle that raged last year over the appointment of a new provincial governor to replace Ye Xuanping, a reformer who had reached retirement age. Hard-liners in Beijing wanted to name one of their own, government spokesman Yuan Mu, in the hope that an outsider could slow the province's pace of economic liberalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Beijing's bid to install its hard-line candidate failed, according to local political observers. The central government eventually accepted a compromise candidate, Zhu Shenlin, technically an outsider because he was not born in the region, but a resident for 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guangdong's officials &quot;no longer feel that Beijing can destroy them,&quot; said one Westerner here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another sign that the Communist Party leadership is grudgingly coming to accept the freewheeling economy here came last month when hard-line Prime Minister Li Peng paid a visit. Li was taken to see the Guangzhou Soap Factory -- a local example of Beijing's current campaign for &quot;revitalization&quot; of state enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guangdong's pet revitalization project, it turned out, was a joint venture with Procter &amp; Gamble that is producing such items as Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and Oil of Olay for the domestic market. The factory was hugely profitable last year, sending Beijing about $ 19 million in taxes -- or more than three times what the Guangzhou Soap Factory had contributed in its previous 35 years, according to local observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li is said to have remarked approvingly at the end of the factory visit, &quot;They are taking Chinese workers and training them to an international standard.&quot; And according to local residents, he later told a meeting of the Guangzhou city leadership: &quot;Reform is the road from which we will not veer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guangdong already is far enough down the capitalist road that it would be hard for the province to turn back, even at Li's insistence. The psychology of entrepreneurship has begun to take hold here and residents are aggressively seeking new ways to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One local businessman, for example, established a small factory here employing 100 seamstresses from Sichuan Province to make swimsuits, using fabric and patterns imported from Hong Kong. To help expand his operations, he is said to have arranged for a Hong Kong businessman to invest the equivalent of about $ 65,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, according to local observers, the money being invested here from Hong Kong is actually Guangdong money that has been exported to the British colony, then re-imported so it will appear to be foreign investment and qualify for special privileges. This process is known here as creating &quot;false foreign devils.&quot; Other clever Guangdong businessmen have found ways to create &quot;false collectives&quot; to take advantage of special breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even state-run businesses here are trying to get in on the action. An example is the Guangdong Silk Co. In the old days, the company's exports were handled by just one foreign-trade company. Then someone suggested that a little competition would help move the merchandise. In place of the old monopoly, 17 export companies were licensed. The following year, exports tripled, according to one observer of the local business scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaffer, a no-nonsense 43-year-old from New York state, jumped into Guangdong seven years ago with his Taiwanese wife to &quot;prove to ourselves we could do it.&quot; He had initially hoped for financial backing from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but when it fell through he came anyway. &quot;We decided it was time to take a chance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His management secret, he said, was that he and his Taiwanese managers &quot;worked like madmen.&quot; He explained: &quot;What I changed was every little detail. I taught them exactly how to cement the bottom of the shoes. Not sort of the way, but exactly the way. . . . By the sheer force of our efforts, we got them to do what we wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his unexpected problems, Shaffer said, was breaking through the stratification of Chinese society -- in which workers are treated differently depending on their Communist Party credentials and their links with the party-run &quot;work unit.&quot; Shaffer said he tried to foster more egalitarianism -- for example, by having workers and managers eat together, rather than in separate dining rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One worry for Shaffer and other investors in this Chinese boom area is the push in the U.S. Congress to withdraw China's most-favored-nation trade status, which allows goods produced here to be sold competitively in American markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's trade status survived this year, but Shaffer said the mere threat that it might be withdrawn led one of his customers, Payless shoe stores, to award a contract for 1.5 million pairs of athletic shoes to a company in Indonesia rather than to his firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one issue the otherwise garrulous Shaffer won't discuss is the profitability of his company, which he named Sabry Trading Co. -- after his children, Sabrina and Ryan -- in part &quot;because no one would know where it was from.&quot; He said he would prefer not to give any profit figures because to do so would weaken his hand in negotiating with Western buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American manufacturing and Asian manufacturing are very different,&quot; Shaffer said in an interview in his office just off the shop floor. &quot;American manufacturers work on much tighter margins, because labor costs are much higher. The shoe business is not very sophisticated, and there are a lot of risks in starting up a business here. But when things go well, they go real well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

His collarbone had been completely sheared from his shoulder, and Jackson suffered massive ligament damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injury came in the second game of the Tigers' season. Immediately after surgery, doctors told Jackson he would not play again that year. Only four games later, he was back and stronger than ever. Only a few years later, millions of people around the country would come to know him simply as Bo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has come to mean magic and power and anything goes, this name Bo. It is slight arrogance backed by unmitigated action and talent. Bo means Just Do It, Did He Really Do That, and please Do It Again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo is a phenomenon, evidence of just what nature is capable of making. Bo is professional football with the Los Angeles Raiders and professional baseball with the Kansas City Royals. Bo is scaling 15-foot outfield walls to catch a fly ball the way normal people run up the stairs to grab a ringing telephone. Bo is a huge home run leading off his first all-star game. Bo can fly at warp factor six, but on the football field, Bo prefers the more direct route, just ask Brian Bosworth. Bo knows running people over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't forget. Bo knows everything.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo can do anything,&quot; said Auburn track and field coach Mel Rosen. &quot;As I've told a lot of people, if Bo didn't play football and baseball he would have been a world-class sprinter. He could have made millions running&quot; sprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last week it was shown that Bo is human too, though since he won the Heisman Trophy in 1985 his image has suggested anything but. The two-sport star was released on Monday by the Royals for a hip injury he suffered playing for the Raiders. The Royals believe the injury is so severe he might never play baseball again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, informed sources said cartilage damage in the hip is so bad that he will never play football or baseball again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cartilage has sort of wasted away&quot; since the injury, the source said. &quot;In reality, he has an old man's arthritic hip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Friday, the New York Yankees, backed by an army of orthopedic specialists, decided it was too risky to claim Jackson off waivers. So did the other 24 major league clubs who followed the Yankees in priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to be able to sign him,&quot; Yankees General Manager Gene Michael said. &quot;We just felt the risk was too great for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite possibly, the week saw the passing of a living legend. Bo is no longer solely sporting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross training shoes, but sporting crutches as well. He has faced and overcome many difficult challenges before -- poverty, for instance -- but this by far is probably his biggest hurdle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My relationship with Bo . . . it's special,&quot; said Auburn trainer Herb Waldrop, who tended Jackson through all his collegiate bumps and bruises. &quot;We share a lot of private things. I care about him and his future, and I don't want to say anything that would jeopardize his future. It's better for me to just not say anything about if I think he can come back or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what I will say is that a challenge affecting his athletic ability is one thing; a physical disability like he might have, that's another thing. This may be tough for even Bo. But if anyone can come back from it, it's Bo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to sit here and say he's going to come back,&quot; said Dallas Cowboys fullback Tommie Agee, who was Bo's roommate and running mate at Auburn and spoke with him this week. &quot;But I hope and pray that he will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, and for many days to come, people everywhere are pondering the possibility of life without Bo as athlete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it's all said and done, when I'm sitting home, and limping, my knee torn up at the age of 23, these sportswriters and these fans are still going to be up in the stands, ripping someone else. I know what my body can do and what my body can't do -- I know better than anyone else -- and I'm not going to go out and force my body to do some superhuman thing just to please a sportswriter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Bo in his book, &quot;Bo Knows Bo&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the day that the seriousness of Jackson's injury really began to become public. But it was Jan. 13 in a Raiders-Cincinnati Bengals NFL playoff game that the tragedy really began. It was then on a breakaway run down the right sideline, a 34-yard gainer, that he injured the hip. The leg was pulled on from behind and, so it now appears, was pulled completely out of the socket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the game the Raiders' medical staff diagnosed a hip pointer, a rather common football injury without complications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't until this past Monday that the Royals confirmed what had been speculated over last weekend -- this was much more serious than a hip pointer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royals' team physician Steve Joyce said Jackson had a fracture dislocation of the left hip and the result was cartilage damage in the hip socket. He felt Bo would not be able play baseball this year and possibly ever again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hour before the Royals' announcement, Bo appeared with his personal physician, James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center. Andrews said Bo had a &quot;significant injury&quot; and blood flow to the hip is being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't count me out,&quot; Bo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews still has not given a specific diagnosis of the injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo spent much of his childhood in a tiny town in Alabama called Raimond. At one point, as he relates in his book, he lived with his mother and a total of eight brothers and sisters in a three-bedroom house. The bathroom was an outhouse. Dinner was sometimes nothing more than grits and margarine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes at night we used to sit around and talk about his childhood,&quot; said Agee, who blocked for Bo at Auburn. Bo says Agee is the main reason he won the Heisman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He went through some incredible things,&quot; Agee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Bo is wealthy. And much of his money comes from the creative </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising that made Bo a household name. Many people know Bo more from the &quot;Bo knows . . . &quot; commercials than from his athletic exploits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is the possibility that the injury could hurt Jackson's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract. Asked if the injury could cost Bo money should he be forced to retire, Liz Dolan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vice president and director of corporate communications, said, &quot;I don't want to say yes or no because it's still early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Bo cleaned out his Royals locker. And cried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still have my home, my family,&quot; he said. &quot;Business deals down the road. Starting a family business, that's in the works. I'm not really dependent on baseball at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the sport. I'd love to play until I'm 70, but that's not possible. I won't pull a [Jim] Palmer and try to come back when I'm 45. When the Man Upstairs says it's over, it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo went fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one of his favorite loves -- second perhaps only to running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One, he feels frustrated,&quot; said Dick Schaap, who co-authored Bo's book and speaks with him frequently. &quot;Two, he's angry at himself for allowing himself to be hurt. I think that's a natural reaction for any athlete to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thirdly, the thing he misses more than anything else is running. Running is his love and passion. It's something he has done all of his life. And now he can't do it. He can fish, but he can't run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported more strongly that Bo may never be able to play professional sports again, something his agent, Richard Woods, disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without an adequate blood supply, the cartilage in the hip begins to die, a condition called chondrolysis. Cartilage rarely grows back and in the few cases when it has, Harvard Medical School's Lyle Micheli said, it happened in athletes age 16 to 18. Jackson is 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact there is a great interruption in his career,&quot; Schaap said, &quot;it's a loss for a lot of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No team in baseball proved willing to take a risk and claim Bo off waivers. The Yankees had the first chance because of their record last year, worst in the Royals' league, the American. Many expected the Yankees -- who have taken gambles with less talented players -- to file their claim. But even the Yankees, who drafted Jackson out of high school in 1982 and considered trading for him a few years ago, wouldn't touch Bo. They said six orthopedic specialists told them not to. Not with a $ 2.375 million contract for 1991, the one he and the Royals agreed upon in February when they didn't know how badly he was damaged, to be picked up with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Woods: &quot;I talked with Bo and I told him I thought he would be picked up by the Yankees. But I told him that there was a chance he would not be claimed, and he was not shocked when no one did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The waiver price was $ 1 and 25 teams looked at $ 2,375,001 and said, &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now people wonder what is ahead. Will Bo no longer be Bo, the man who showed us that so much more is possible than we imagined? Will he be able to show us one more time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that he has always shown in the past that there is nothing he likes better than a clear challenge,&quot; said Schaap. &quot;He has spent most of his life and most of his career proving people wrong. He would like nothing better than to come back and hit a home run against the Royals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo being the type of person he is, he didn't want to leave Kansas City in that fashion,&quot; said Agee. &quot;That's not how Bo wants to leave the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bo is one of a kind. Not too many come around like Bo, and not many more will come around like Bo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Baseball and football star Bo Jackson delighted a group of high school journalists yesterday stories about his rise to fame and comments on his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson held a news conference for the students at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town, the new shoe store opened last fall by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., one of Jackson's advertising employers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson continually spoke with wonder about how a poor boy from rural Alabama could grow up and become a rich, famous man. &quot;A nappy-headed kid who threw rocks better than some people could shoot a gun,&quot; is how Jackson described himself then, and a family man who loves children is how he sees himself now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A charmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two of his own children watching from a balcony above, Jackson charmed the group with an easy demeanor - a contrast to his sometimes shy and surly dealings with professional media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson walked in to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Town wearing an earring and a sweatsuit. As soon as he started joking about the &quot;nice, sunny city of Portland,&quot; he put the students at ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to introduce his family, Jackson said his oldest son was nicknamed &quot;Spud,&quot; his younger son was &quot;a human tornado,&quot; and his infant daughter decided herself not to fly to Portland because of an ear infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's humor continually broke through a deadpan delivery and a grave expression. A student asked what Jackson wanted to be remembered for, and the response was a furrowed brow, a glare and a mock-serious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Am I going anywhere I should know about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the questions were facile:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is Jackson's favorite TV commercial?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last one I did, the multisport Jackson. They wedged me in that sports car, and it took three people to pull me out. The Indy 500 is not in my future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were serious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the use of steroids in sports?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know anything about that. I would not know what a steroid is if you came up here and smacked me in the face with it. Go ask (sprinter) Ben Johnson about that. Bo don't know steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enjoys his work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some were obvious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which sport do you enjoy more, football or baseball?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You wouldn't believe how many times I've been asked that. I enjoy my work as far as the business aspect goes. It's my job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a visit to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, the other day I found myself reflecting upon what a bittersweet experience it has become to see wild animals in captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this zoo is considered to be among the finest in the United States, most of the species in it are threatened, endangered or already extinct in the wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, I've been keeping track of Associated Press reports on the subject of how the human race is treating earth's wild creatures. You may not be surprised to learn that much of the news ranges from bad to horrifying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few examples. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Charles &quot;Bart&quot; Bartholomew, owner of the 160-acre Texoma Hunting Wilderness near Bennington in southern Oklahoma, has been jailed for six months for cruelty after an estimated 200 animals, all protected under state or federal laws, were killed at the preserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animals, including grizzly bears, black bears, elk, deer and cougars, were kept in cages so small that they could barely fit inside, and deprived of adequate food and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunters paid up to $6,000 to have an animal released from its cage into a fenced-in field, where it was shot. One tame bear was enticed to follow a trail of marshmallows, and was killed as it bent to pick one up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The world's largest oceanarium, Shedd Aquarium, opened recently in Chicago. Audiences sit on seats carved out of a man-made cliff and watch dolphins and beluga whales perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aquarium spokesperson Betsey Raymond said, &quot;We want visitors to gain an appreciation of the fragility of the northwest coast environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the oceanarium's residents have already learned that particular lesson. The belugas were captured from Churchill River in Canada, and the dolphins from Monterey Bay off California.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a visit to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, the other day I found myself reflecting upon what a bittersweet experience it has become to see wild animals in captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this zoo is considered to be among the finest in the United States, most of the species in it are threatened, endangered or already extinct in the wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, I've been keeping track of Associated Press reports on the subject of how the human race is treating earth's wild creatures. You may not be surprised to learn that much of the news ranges from bad to horrifying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few examples. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Charles &quot;Bart&quot; Bartholomew, owner of the 160-acre Texoma Hunting Wilderness near Bennington in southern Oklahoma, has been jailed for six months for cruelty after an estimated 200 animals, all protected under state or federal laws, were killed at the preserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animals, including grizzly bears, black bears, elk, deer and cougars, were kept in cages so small that they could barely fit inside, and deprived of adequate food and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunters paid up to $ 6,000 to have an animal released from its cage into a fenced-in field, where it was shot. One tame bear was enticed to follow a trail of marshmallows, and was killed as it bent to pick one up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The world's largest oceanarium, Shedd Aquarium, opened recently in Chicago. Audiences sit on seats carved out of a man-made cliff and watch dolphins and beluga whales perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aquarium spokesperson Betsey Raymond said, &quot;We want visitors to gain an appreciation of the fragility of the northwest coast environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the oceanarium's residents have already learned that particular lesson. The belugas were captured from Churchill River in Canada, and the dolphins from Monterey Bay off California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A dolphin named Pollyanna has died at Ocean World in Fort Lauderdale. She was captured in 1966 near the Florida Keys, and spent the rest of her life in a tank the size of a backyard swimming pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ocean World has been the target of many protests, as well as a federal investigation into animal abuses. A larger dolphin pool is currently under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Teneiya, a condor chick, has hatched at the Los Angeles Zoo, and is believed to be the 50th California condor in existence. These huge carrion-eating birds, with wingspans of almost 10 feet, are almost extinct in the wild. Directly and indirectly, human predators are the reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, just when purists have reluctantly started to resign themselves to this godawful apparition, the born-again Agassi embraces . . . tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with his image as a creature of extremes, for his maiden appearance yesterday at centre court at the All England Club the clean-shaven Agassi wore (gasp) white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White warmup suit. White crop-topped shirt. White shorts with white lycra cycling shorts. White socks. White tennis shoes. White headband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contrast was Grant Connell, Agassi's Canadian-born opponent who was also dressed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He looked like a peacock - even though he conformed to Wimbledon's &quot;predominantly white&quot; clothing rules. That is to say, the Vancouver southpaw's shoes had jade green markings and his first shirt was splashed with blue and hot pink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3:45 p.m., Agassi, swathed in a white nylon warmup suit, arrived on centre court to a swell of applause from a gallery that included the Duchess of Kent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milking the occasion for all it was worth, Agassi went over to his chair and slowly, like a stripper, began to disrobe. As he took off his pants, revealing his white look, there were wolf whistles, cheers, applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When rain began again at 5:08 p.m., washing out play for the rest of the day with but a meager six matches completed, Agassi and Connell were level at one set each and 1-1 in games in the third. The No. 73-ranked Connell took the first 6-4 and the fifth-seeded Agassi the second 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what had to be most distracting and intimidating circumstances, Connell did himself proud. He kept his poise, served and volleyed well and moved confidently on the slippery grass. He broke Agassi in the seventh game, then conceded just three more points on his own serve en route to claiming the first set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi, who had not played a grass court match since losing in the first round here in 1987, started out looking uncomfortable on the unfamiliar turf but grew increasingly comfortable and aggressive as the match progressed. By the second set, he'd harnessed his errant first serve and begun whaling his returns of serve, racking up 16 winners, and broke Connell twice to build a 5-0 lead. When Agassi is firing at that level, no one can blunt his attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Agassi had the momentum when play stopped, he is vulnerable on grass. There is no evidence that his volleying has improved. He still tends to wind up and take a big swing in mid-court, rarely comes in to crowd the net, rarely opts to come in to volley off his serve. In other words, he has made few adjustments to his normal hard-hitting style to accommodate the vagaries of grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might beat Connell. But he's won't be a serious contender for the men's title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connell is not throwing in the towel. Having put to rest his pre- match jitters and having had some time to assess the match, he's not pessimistic that he can come back and win - weather permitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great feeling. I loved it. But he's damn good, so I have to get in my first serves and then it's down to two out of three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other matches, top-seeded defending champion Stefan Edberg finally finished the match he started Tuesday, defeating Swiss Marc Rosset 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Eight- seeded U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras won his first Wimbledon match - 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 over Brazilian Danilo Marcelino - and sixth-seeded German Michael Stich removed American Dan Goldie 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the other Canadians finished. Montreal's Martin Laurendeau is leading 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 2-2 in his match with Briton Danny Sapsford. Patricia Hy of Richmond Hill won the first set 6-2 against veteran South African Ros Fairbank-Nideffer.</SPAN></P>

He broke Agassi in the seventh game, then conceded just three more points on his own serve en route to claiming the first set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi, who had not played a grass court match since losing in the first round here in 1987, started out looking uncomfortable on the unfamiliar turf but grew increasingly comfortable and aggressive as the match progressed. By the second set, he'd harnessed his errant first serve and begun whaling his returns of serve, racking up 16 winners, and broke Connell twice to build a 5-0 lead. When Agassi is firing at that level, no one can blunt his attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Agassi had the momentum when play stopped, he is vulnerable on grass. There is no evidence that his volleying has improved. He still tends to wind up and take a big swing in midcourt, rarely comes in to crowd the net, rarely opts to come in to volley off his serve. In other words, he has made few adjustments to his normal hard-hitting style to accommodate the vagaries of grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might beat Connell. But he's won't be a serious contender for the men's title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connell is not throwing in the towel. Having put to rest his prematch jitters and having had some time to assess the match, he's not pessimistic that he can come back and win - weather permitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great feeling. I loved it. But he's damn good, so I have to get in my first serves and then it's down to two out of three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other matches, top-seeded defending champion Stefan Edberg finally finished the match he started Tuesday, defeating Swiss Marc Rosset 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Eightseeded U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras won his first Wimbledon match - 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 over Brazilian Danilo Marcelino - and sixth-seeded German Michael Stich removed American Dan Goldie 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the other Canadians finished. Montreal's Martin Laurendeau is leading 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 2-2 in his match with Briton Danny Sapsford. Patricia Hy of Richmond Hill won the first set 6-2 against veteran South African Ros Fairbank-Nideffer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN BBDO/Los Angeles abruptly resigned the $60 million L.A. Gear account on Friday after only a little more than two months on the job, many industry executives were not surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship was probably doomed from the start, some executives said. L.A. Gear, the country's third-largest athletic shoe company, after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok, had been creating its own ads for years. Except for a two-week stint with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the company had never worked with an established agency like BBDO. One of the country's biggest agencies, BBDO creates ads for Apple Computer, Pepsi and General Electric.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BBDO cited fundamental creative differences as the cause of its resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, L.A. Gear said it thought everything had been going just fine. Sandy Saemann, a founder of L.A. Gear and an executive vice president, said the company was shocked by BBDO's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBDO had been hired as a creative consultant, but agency executives said the problem was that L.A. Gear simply did not want any advice. L.A. Gear still insisted on controlling every aspect of its advertising, they said, and would not allow BBDO to hire commercial production companies, directors or film editors it had successfully used for other clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These executives said they found one L.A. Gear practice particularly irksome: The company was said to order top agency executives to come over for meetings, then keep them waiting for several hours while L.A. Gear executives attended to other business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the agency executives said the final blow came when L.A. Gear insisted on using a commercial for its new Catapult shoe that BBDO executives thought was inappropriate. The commercial was first shown during the telecast of the Super Bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Hayden, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO/Los Angeles, said the agency was particularly unhappy that L.A. Gear insisted on using the theme line &quot;Everything else is just hot air&quot; in the Catapult commercials. The agency had advised L.A. Gear not to use the theme, which takes a swipe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its spokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls professional basketball team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mr. Hayden said the agency had also told L.A. Gear that the Asics Tiger Corporation, a Japanese athletic shoe company, was using the &quot;hot air&quot; line in commercials in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both NBC and CBS refused to run the ad, saying it was an unsubstantiated potshot at a competitor. NBC later reversed its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought the commercial was a cheap shot,&quot; Mr. Hayden said. &quot;We saw it as a public relations gimmick, and that is not our style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hayden also said the advertising for L.A. Gear that was being presented as BBDO's work had been substantially altered by L.A. Gear and was &quot;not up to BBDO's standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement, Mr. Saemann said the Catapult commercial had been one of the company's most effective ads. &quot;We see the Catapult commercial as a pivotal point in the evolvement of our company,&quot; he said. &quot;We feel we know our audience best and chose to override some of BBDO's creative decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Gear would not say whether it would seek another agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has indicated that it will fight a patent infringement lawsuit filed last week in Federal District Court in Los Angeles by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which contends that the Catapult shoe infringes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patents for a heel spring and lace system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok International abruptly pulled its $40 million account from Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos yesterday and split the business between the New York agencies Chiat/Day/Mojo and Lois/GGK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok would not comment on its reasons for dismissing Hill, Holiday, a move that comes a little less than a year after the Boston agency won the account in a highly publicized review. But agency executives said Reebok had made the move because Hill, Holiday's ads failed to create any excitement for the company's athletic shoes and failed to gain ground on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is No. 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executives at Hill, Holiday would not comment. The agency had produced only one big campaign for Reebok. With the tagline &quot;It's time to play,&quot; the ads showed athletes and others playing in their Reeboks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some agency executives said Reebok had become desperate to find a hard-hitting campaign to use against the comparative ads from some of its competitors, and it turned to Lois/ GGK late last year to produce commercials for its &quot;pump&quot; shoes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> 'They Created a Buzz'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign from Lois/GGK, called &quot;Pump up and Air out,&quot; featured athletes taking a swipe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association, and the maker's Air Jordan shoes. The campaign was criticized by its competitors and some agency executives because it took what they said was an unwarranted potshot at Mr. Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernadette Mansur, a spokeswoman for Reebok, said the company was pleased with the ads from Lois/ GGK. &quot;They created a buzz about Reebok with retailers and consumers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Chiat/Day had resigned the bulk of the Reebok account in January 1990 after it was put in review, the agency has continued to create advertising for the company's Weebok's children's shoes and for its business outside the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency executives said Reebok was a difficult client. The company demands innovative approaches, they said, but then often criticizes an agency for &quot;being too creative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiat/Day, which had the entire Reebok account for three years before the bulk of it went to Hill, Holiday, lost the account in large part because of its quirky &quot;Reebok lets U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which Reebok executives reportedly thought was too far out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercials showed people doing idiosyncratic things like vacuuming a carpet on a lawn. The ads were criticized within the advertising industry for not focusing on the performance of the athletic shoes and for not increasing sales. While Chiat/Day had the account, Reebok lost its No. 1 position to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Reebok is back, Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive worldwide of Chiat/Day/Mojo, said he was pleased. &quot;It's great,&quot; he said. &quot;Clients don't often return to an agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok is the latest in a number of clients who have split their accounts between agencies to double their chances of getting good work. During the last several years both Burger King and I.B.M. have divided their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this setup could obviously foster competitive rivalries, George Lois, the chairman and chief executive of Lois/GGK, said he was not worried. &quot;There is no reason we can't be a great team,&quot; he said. &quot;Agencies are going to have to become comfortable with these kinds of arrangements, because it's obviously a direction more clients are moving in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 70 years in the sneaker business, Converse Inc. is pinning its future on five words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught flatfooted in the great sneaker war of the 80's, the company has been eating the dust raised by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reebok and L.A. Gear for five years. Using glitzy, celebrity-studded commercials to push one new line of high-performance sneakers after another, the Big Three have grabbed two-thirds of the athletic shoe business while helping to triple its size, to $5.6 billion annually in the United States. Meanwhile, Converse, hobbled by a scattershot approach to marketing, has been stuck with a 2 percent share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the company is gambling $22 million on a new ad campaign built around the slogan, &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts.&quot; The campaign, which begins Thursday, is designed to highlight the company's long tradition of making solid, if unexciting, sneakers -- at a price lower than the Big Three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign, which features basketball stars Larry Bird and Bernard King, is particularly important to Converse, which has recently been operating in the troubled shadow of its parent, Interco Inc. The St. Louis-based furniture and footwear company, weighed down with debt in fighting off a hostile takeover 1988 attempt, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Boston-based advertising agency that is producing the commercials, Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, has a lot riding on the campaign as well. The second-largest agency in New England after Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., IQ&amp;J has represented Converse for eight years and counts it as one of its most important national clients. Although IQ&amp;J largely escaped blame for past marketing failings -- Converse says a lack of direction on its own part was the chief villain -- the agency is under intense pressure to deliver the goods with the new campaign. Just last Friday, the point was underscored when Hill, Holiday lost its Reebok account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Converse and IQ&amp;J worked together is a tale of creative chaos, tight deadlines and taut nerves. The three-month the effort tested the resources -- and the patience -- of client and agency both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort began in earnest last September. Gordon Tucker, Converse's fourth marketing director in as many years, had concluded a summer of research with a list of adjectives that encapsulated consumer and trade perceptions of the company's major products, which include Magic Johnson basketball shoes and Chuck Taylor All Stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company had been marketing its brands separately, diluting the impact of the Converse name. The adjectives -- confident, passionate, hard-working, tough, selfish and genuine -- were to be used as guidelines for pushing the Converse name itself, particularly with the key buying group, teen-agers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IQ&amp;J assigned two creative teams to the project to compete in coming up with the campaign, a traditional industry practice. The teams were a study in contrasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One paired Don Pogany, a copywriter who recently left the agency, with Peter Favat, an art director. Both men wear faded blue jeans to work; Mr. Favat accents his with cowboy boots and a small gold earring. They had made ads before for Converse, marked by fast-paced editing and clever punch lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second team, new to the Converse account, consisted of Mike Sheehan, in the copywriter slot, and Robert Rich as the art director, both of whom are more conservative in dress and taste. They favor a simple, direct approach in their ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some agencies devise campaigns on their own and present finished ideas to clients, IQ&amp;J executives prefer to hold a series of sessions in which they show their work in progress. At these, the &quot;tissue meetings,&quot; concepts are explored through drawings on tissue paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Involving the client in the creative process means there are no surprises,&quot; said Bruce Kelley, IQ&amp;J's president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first meeting was scheduled for Nov. 13. Mr. Tucker wanted a finished campaign idea by the end of that month, in time for Converse's annual sales meeting on Dec. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two creative teams plowed through newspapers, magazines and books looking for sports images. They devised three potential campaigns, tried to eliminate one but finally decided to present all three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning of the first tissue meeting was cold even by Massachusetts standards. About a dozen executives met in a cramped conference room at Converse headquarters in North Reading, Mass., about 20 miles north of Boston. The atmosphere was casual. IQ&amp;J's executive creative director, Christine Chamberlin, explained the ground rules: a first tissue meeting was meant to be a broad review, a place to discard concepts the client didn't like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency opened with &quot;Worn in the USA,&quot; which everyone agreed was the wildest but weakest idea. Mr. Favat turned on a boom box and danced around the room in flawless imitation of a team mascot at a half-time show. The campaign, he said, would depict fans of a high school football team readying themselves for the game. Mr. Tucker laughed, but it was clear he didn't take the approach seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came a campaign built around a school locker room. One ad closed with a voice reminiscing, &quot;The moments are temporary but some things are permanent. Converse -- some things never wear out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To present the third concept, &quot;The Original,&quot; Mr. Sheehan also took his audience inside a school locker room. A coach tossed boxes of Converse sneakers at his players. &quot;We play as a team, we dress as a team,&quot; he tells them. The tagline: &quot;Converse -- The Original.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tucker asked the agency people which approach they preferred and Mr. Kelley pushed hard for &quot;The Original.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows there is us and there is them,&quot; Mr. Kelley said, explaining that it set Converse apart from other brands with its &quot;pre-emptive statement&quot; that it was the original sneaker. Mr. Tucker was unconvinced, arguing that such a distinction had little meaning outside the industry. But he liked the idea of associating Converse with the timeless moments and youthful exuberance of sports. &quot;Sports teach kids about values,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That image fits us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four members of the creative teams smiled politely like small children chastised by their mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second tissue meeting was scheduled at IQ&amp;J's offices for 5:30 P.M. on Nov. 20, two days before Thanksgiving. The meeting started about an hour late because the agency people simply couldn't agree on what to present. Some thought Mr. Tucker's suggestion of associating sports with values was hokey. Some felt Converse needed to outdo the stylized approach of other sneaker companies. Some refused to give up on &quot;The Original.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelley tried to start the meeting off on a positive note by introducing an idea for a new Magic Johnson billboard. Mr. Tucker hated it. The agency then tried to salvage &quot;The Original&quot; theme. Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Rich had discovered that several Larry Birds were listed in local phone books. They envisioned ads asking &quot;What is an original?&quot; in which these noncelebrities would discuss their feelings about sports. But the consensus was that the idea closely resembled Reebok's unsuccessful &quot;UBU&quot; (you-be-you) campaign from a couple of years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Chamberlin addressed Mr. Tucker's values issue head-on with an idea entitled &quot;Stand for Something.&quot; She offered examples of coaches lecturing athletes on the sins of being late to practice and letting the team down. Mr. Tucker politely suggested it was too preachy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four hours, Mr. Tucker was frustrated. The agency had presented a jumble of ideas. He liked the regular guy approach and was still attached to looking inside the minds of young athletes and examining their feelings about sports. Ms. Chamberlin told her staff to enjoy Thanksgiving and come in over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But early on Monday, the 26th, Ms. Chamberlin told IQ&amp;J's chairman, Richard C. Garrison, that her staff was still at odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garrison drove to Converse's offices in an attempt to buy more time. Mr. Tucker refused. Mr. Garrison then vowed that by the time Mr. Tucker left Friday for his sales meeting in Miami, IQ&amp;J would have sold him a finished campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garrison returned to IQ&amp;J and tersely told the Converse team they needed to stop bickering and find an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, the group went back to its list of 300 taglines and finally saw what it had been looking for. &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts&quot; had been analyzed, re-analyzed and finally dumped shortly before the previous meeting. Now, it fit the bill. It addressed the values issue that Mr. Tucker insisted upon. And the word &quot;inside&quot; gave Converse an opportunity to sell specific product benefits of its shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with the tagline, the creative teams dusted off the second version of &quot;The Original&quot; campaign, devising a number of ads featuring noncelebrities talking about sports. (The focus ultimately changed to celebrities discussing their lives.) The campaign's tone belonged to the Sheehan-Rich team. The proposed look -- including a reliance on fast-paced editing -- came from Mr. Pogany and Mr. Favat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garrison called Mr. Tucker to say the agency had found the answer. Privately, he and Mr. Kelley kept their fingers crossed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tucker arrived at IQ&amp;J at precisely 8 A.M. on Friday, and two hours later he bought the campaign. When he left, he found a limousine with champagne waiting at the curb, courtesy of Mr. Garrison, to take him to the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Mr. Tucker's turn to sell the campaign, to Converse's president, Gilbert Ford. On Saturday, Mr. Ford signed on. On Sunday, so did the sales force. Now, after nearly four months of production, the question is whether the public will sign on, too.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>MAKING IT -- OFF MAD. AVE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard C. Garrison, the chairman and chief executive of Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, is determined to hold onto the Converse account, which, after Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and T. J. Maxx, a national chain of discount apparel stores, is the biggest client at the Boston-based agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Mr. Garrison wants to use the new Converse campaign as a national showcase for IQ&amp;J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The creative element of the advertising is particularly powerful in the sneaker wars,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to deal with accounts that have high-quality brand names and high visibility as national players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garrison's notion of national prominence does not include moving out of Boston, however. Although many regional agencies expand by opening offices in other cities, Mr. Garrison believes national accounts will come to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants his firm to remain a single office focusing on large accounts in the Northeast corridor and linking up with international agency networks at his clients' request. He dubs IQ&amp;J a mini-network because it provides a range of communications services -- public relations, design and direct response -- in addition to advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IQ&amp;J's turbulent recent history makes Mr. Garrison leery of rapid expansion. In 1986, Quinn &amp; Johnson/BBDO, a small Boston subsidiary of the large New York agency, BBDO Inc., bought 80-year-old Ingalls Associates to create Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson. But then BBDO merged with two other mega-agencies, Doyle Dane Bernbach of New York and Needham Harper Worldwide of Chicago, to form the Omnicom Group, which had $8.4 billion in billings last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 42-year-old Mr. Garrison, who had become president of the combined IQ&amp;J, quickly discovered he was a very small fish in a huge pond. So in February 1989, he and four partners borrowed $4.5 million to purchase IQ&amp;J. The five felt that conflicts of interest with Omnicom accounts restricted the agency's growth. Since the firm became independent, its total billings have grown 14 percent, to $134 million last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom also allowed Mr. Garrison to infuse the agency with an entrepreneurial spirit. &quot;There's a lot of screaming and yelling and passion flowing in the halls,&quot; Mr. Garrison says with a mischievous grin. &quot;But we don't have that many jerks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROBERT Y. GREENBERG sold wigs, roller skates and shoe laces before founding L.A. Gear Inc. in 1985, and since then he has sold enough sneakers to make the company third in the athletic footwear market, behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok. But having been battered recently by poor merchandising and marketing and a weak economy, Mr. Greenberg said last week that L.A. Gear is now trying to sell a &quot;substantial&quot; minority stake in the company in what analysts say is an effort to keep it afloat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few years, L.A. Gear was one of the fastest-growing companies in the country. Sales grew from $70.6 million in 1987 to $902.2 million last year behind Mr. Greenberg's strategy of offering a cross between the performance athletic shoes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok and a fashion shoe. But then, analysts said, Mr. Greenberg's fashion sense deserted him. The company got caught with an excessive inventory heading into the recession. And Mr. Greenberg may have compounded his problems by competing directly with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok in performance shoes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L.A. Gear moved earlier this year to slash its payroll, and Mr. Greenberg promised to forgo his $1.5 million salary until the company moved out of the red for a full quarter. A spokesman said Mr. Greenberg, who is 51 and owns a 20 percent stake in the company that is currently worth more than $40 million, was traveling and not available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin J. Ventrudo, chief financial officer, said suggestions that L.A. Gear is struggling to survive are way off the mark and that new products and marketing would allow it to keep growing. Even so, some analysts question whether any new minority owner and the company's banks will let Mr. Greenberg continue to call the shots.<BR></SPAN></P>

Neck-and-neck with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the most popular person in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gatorade, Wheaties.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Magic Johnson: Slow starter.

A pleasure to work with. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Franklin Sports, Casio.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Bo Jackson: This will be his last big year.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high school coach saw a future for his slow, frail point guard that had nothing to do with professional basketball or the United States Olympic team. The kid reminded him of himself, years before, a 5-foot-9-inch scrapper just grateful for the chance to play, be it at a blip in the college basketball universe known as Henderson State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Wayne's coach at that tiny Arkansas college, Donald Dyer, had since moved on to Central Arkansas, a power in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Wayne had ended up in Hamburg (population 3,000) in the southeastern corner of the state. Now he placed a call to Dyer to sell him on Scottie Pippen, his 5-11, 145-pound scholarship-less senior.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coach from the nearest state campus, at Monticello, had already told Pippen, sorry, no vacancies. South Arkansas University in Magnolia sent him home after a tryout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last shot,&quot; Wayne said of his call to Dyer, who said he, too, had filled his incoming class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne kept talking. &quot;What the heck, send him up,&quot; Dyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was June 1983. Pippen arrived with a sales pitch that went no further than &quot;Yes, sir. No, sir.&quot; He worked out for Dyer, then sat himself in the coach's office and let his older brother, Billy, do the talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can offer you work-study,&quot; Dyer said, finally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You mean team manager?&quot; big brother Billy asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the younger Pippen had experienced no difficulties serving as the manager for Hamburg's football team, dispensing soap and towels as he would the basketball, this was not the insult another player might have taken it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottie Pippen took the job, and that is how he got to college, last stop before the Chicago Bulls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Best evaluation of talent I ever made,&quot; said Donald Dyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You could make hundreds of dollars playing professional basketball, son,&quot; Scottie Pippen is told at the end of his new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial, which places him inside a black-and-white, 1940's basketball setting. The commercial was shot in Los Angeles and made its debut during Game 1 of the World Series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've come a long way from my first commercials,&quot; Pippen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which were?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;City Chevrolet of Chicago,&quot; he said. &quot;And Mr. Submarine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This endorsement business, of course, is relative. Eight years ago, long before his recent five-year, $18 million contract extension and selection to the 1992 United States Olympic team, the tax bracket promised Pippen in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial would have bordered on fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, before the Bulls won the franchise's first N.B.A. championship and he played shockingly effective defense in the finals against the Lakers' Magic Johnson, Pippen wasn't even one of 24 N.B.A. All-Stars in Charlotte, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 26-year-old Pippen has made the strangest leaps across daunting canyons. If high school to college was unconventional, then how unlikely was his long jump from Central Arkansas to the first round of the National Basketball Association draft in 1987? Seattle picked him fifth over all and then shipped his rights to the Chicago Bulls for another first-rounder, Olden Polynice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pippen's best friend on the Bulls, power forward Horace Grant, was also a first-round pick by Chicago that year, out of Clemson. &quot;Never heard of him or his school,&quot; Grant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pippen then set out on what would become his most spectacular rise. If Michael Jordan with the ball in midflight is beyond description, then Pippen's occupation of neighboring air space is beyond N.B.A. logic. Here is a midsize player who has elevated himself from complete unknown to universally recognized superstar and has done so in the shadow of the most devastating midsize talent the sport has ever produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's one of the stars of this league now,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;He should be treated accordingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the United States Olympic selections, while requesting anonymity, said that Pippen was the fourth player chosen, behind Jordan, Patrick Ewing and David Robinson. Pippen interpreted his selection to mean he had &quot;arrived, basically speaking.&quot; Bulls Coach Phil Jackson speaks more expansively. &quot;The reason we were able to win the championship last year was the development of Scottie Pippen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bulls lost two games in four playoff series, with Jordan and Pippen carving up opposing defenses and the outdated thinking of building championship teams around a franchise center, from the inside out. The quick and versatile, they demonstrated, had inherited the hardwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 6 feet 8 inches and 215 pounds, angular and muscular, Pippen has grown into the prototypical N.B.A. small forward without surrendering the instincts and skills of a guard. &quot;What people may not yet realize is that what we have here is a Julius Erving-type player,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That name comes to mind when Pippen is attacking the lane, ball firm in his right hand as if magnetically drawn, preparing for one of his patented power dunks. By comparing him with Erving -- Pippen's boyhood idol -- Jackson is painting more than a stately picture. He is saying that Pippen, like Jordan, is a revolutionary talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you the game last year, against the Clippers, when I realized that Scottie had made it to the next level, and I think he only got 8 points,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;He had something like 11 rebounds, 11 assists and was all over the place defensively. He'll probably average something like 18 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists for us this year. If you just go by the numbers, you won't have any idea of his impact on our team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottie Pippen is the youngest of 12 children -- six boys, six girls -- born to Preston and Ethel Pippen. When he was in the ninth grade, his father, a retired factory worker, suffered a stroke and was bedridden or confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, unable to speak. It was a terrible burden for the children, as their father's condition worsened each year. Preston Pippen never attended a game at Central Arkansas, where his son experienced startling growth, on and off the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone in my family was pretty tall so we always thought I would get bigger,&quot; Pippen said. He became the tallest Pippen, reaching 6 feet 7 inches by his junior year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By then he was on full basketball scholarship, averaging 18.5 points as a sophomore. Dyer could hardly believe this metamorphosis, and couldn't believe his luck. With his own burgeoning sense of self, Pippen ferociously attacked the weights. When he made out the annual &quot;goal card&quot; that Dyer requested at the start of every season, Pippen wrote: &quot;I would like to be an N.B.A. player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the first time I'd ever said it,&quot; Pippen said. &quot;Before that, I would've been ashamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his senior year, still playing guard, he averaged 23 points and made almost 60 percent of his shots. He went to the post-season N.B.A. audition camps and sent general managers and scouts scrambling to the telephones. &quot;They didn't know who to call,&quot; said Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton. &quot;No one from the network -- Bobby Knight, Dean Smith -- knew who he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better than the Olympic selection, better than the N.B.A. championship, better even than his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial, was the moment he called home after being picked in the draft. His mother told him: &quot;Your daddy watched you on TV. He's got tears running down his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was during a playoff series with Philadelphia in 1990 that Pippen's father died. A short while later, on the day of a seventh game against defending champion Detroit, Pippen suffered his infamous headache, paralyzing him for much of a depressing defeat. The year before, he suffered a concussion after taking an elbow to the head during another losing playoff series against the bruising Pistons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, last spring, came revenge, a four-game sweep of the Pistons, their hated Central Division rival, in the Eastern Conference finals. This time, when Pippen was knocked down by Dennis Rodman, he got up and laughed a champion's last laugh. His line for 17 playoff games averaged out to 21 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists per game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scottie's breakthrough was the Detroit series, no question,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;He dominated them. He made them respect him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bulls' locker room one night before a recent exhibition game, a portrait of Pippen soaring to the basket was presented to him by Rick Lighton, a Michigan artist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too much muscle in the arms and legs,&quot; said Chuck Nevitt, the 7-5 journeyman center, standing nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Pippen said. He pulled off the right sleeve of his warm-up jacket. Striking a pose next to the portrait, he flexed a sculptured muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevitt looked impressed. The artist, Lighton, smiled at the accuracy of his brush. From 145-pound team manager, Scottie Pippen had become quite a piece of work.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM recently rolled out the red carpet for Showcase, a cooperative processing tool designed to let users tap directly into an Application System/400 database from a spreadsheet running on an IBM Personal Computer or workstation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showcase integrates Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 3.0 and Excel spreadsheet on PCs or Personal System/2s. It can be used to create graphics on the workstation with data stored on the AS/400. Access to the application is as simple as selecting an icon, company officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A good spreadsheet writer can run a query, go into the spreadsheet, the Showcase macro kicks in and boom, here comes the pie chart from information in the AS/400,&quot; said James Louys, vice president of ADM, Inc., an AS/400 consulting firm in Cheshire, Conn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developed by Rochester Software Connection, Inc. in Rochester, Minn., Showcase is the brainchild of a group of former IBM executives who started the software firm in 1989. The product has been shipping for about six months and has about 300 users, but IBM only gave its blessing last month and will now sell it directly to customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What these guys are producing are the bells and whistles that IBM has promised its AS/400 customers but hasn't had the time to do itself,&quot; said Teresa Elms, president of Elms Information Services Group in San Diego.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he Brandenburg Gate is 200 years old this week and, in celebration, it has been awarded the Iron Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross in question is firmly grasped by Berlin's ''victory goddess'', who has been restored and placed in her original position, crowning the edifice. The restoration is, however, causing a good deal of angst in a city that has long seen the Brandenburg Gate as a symbol for the militarism of the past and the murder of its own citizens during the division of Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in the ''zentrale Bereich'' - a huge bomb site in the city centre where the new government quarter will eventually be built - the gate has also powerfully symbolised German nationhood. Once cut off from West Berlin by the infamous Wall, the Brandenburg Gate is now in the centre of the reunited city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it was part of the fabric of the Iron Curtain, it stood for division. ''As long as the Brandenburg Gate remains shut the German question will remain open,'' once wrote President Richard von Weizsacker. The gate was opened again in December 1989 but for some this simply posed a new ''German question''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resplendent after a 15-month restoration, the gate has found itself at the centre of controversy. Should the gate, topped by the victory goddess's staff with its Prussian eagle and Iron Cross (the medal designed to commemorate the German victory over Napoleon), be allowed to continue a symbol of military might at a time of the greatest, democratic, citizens' revolution since 1945?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goddess herself is a schizophrenic creature. She has had two incarnations - as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Berliners refer to her as ''Victoria''), goddess of victory, and as Eireni, goddess of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restoration was planned and would have gone ahead - eventually - in its present form under the old East German regime. It was brought forward because of unification, its impending bicentennial and the damage done by hundreds of New Year's revellers who had wrought considerable damage by clambering on to the gate and, in the process, pruning and pocketing laurel leaves from the goddess's crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fierce debate was sparked by the decision to return the sculpture to its pre-Second World War appearance - the last historical phase for which there are records. It was done for reasons of authenticity and because there are no records of the gate's original appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original designers of the gate would have been bemused by the controversy. They certainly did not intend to create a national monument, nor even a triumphal arch. Das Brandenburger Tor was simply one of 18 gates set into the Berlin ramparts. It was particularly fine because it terminated the main avenue, Unter den Linden, leading from the royal palace and was situated on the main route to Brandenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design by Carl G Langhans was inspired by the propylaeum, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. It reflected Prussia's aspirations at the time towards the ideals of Greek culture - peace, order, democracy - rather than military Roman ones with which it has become associated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quadriga, the four-horsed chariot driven by the goddess, was created by Johann Gottfried Schadow, the foremost Prussian sculptor of the day. Before the image of the Greek goddess of peace, Eireni, was finally chosen, other candidates to be formed in copper included an allegorical figure of Berlin accompanied by a bear (pet symbol of Berlin) and a figure representing the river Spree with a swan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government decree declared that the gate should be called the Tor des Frieden - ''Gate of Peace'' - and the words were to have been carved on the structure. But, just 15 years after its completion, the structure's significance was totally transformed: after Napoleon's victory at Jena, when he entered Berlin through the Brandenburg Gate, he took the quadriga back to Paris as a trophy - where, apparently, it was stored in boxes in the orangery of the Louvre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the quadriga came back to Berlin in a triumphant procession in 1815 the Brandenburg Gate was ready to become the symbol of victory: a popular war of liberation against Napoleon had been won and Eireni changed her identity to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goddess of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the quadriga was put back, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the great Prussian Neo-Classical architect responsible for the remodelling of central Berlin (whose work is currently being celebrated in an exhibition at the V &amp; A), replaced the staff that the goddess held. It remained in this form - surmounted by a Prussian eagle, a laurel wreath and an Iron Cross - until the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of the gate underwent further transformation during the nineteenth century. As Berlin grew and the old ramparts disappeared, the gate was detached from its walls and became a freestanding monument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prussia finally had its revenge on France in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the square on the gate's eastern side was renamed Pariser Platz, the equivalent of Trafalgar Square. It was under Bismarck that Prussia's symbol became identified with German imperialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Third Reich the gate became a focus of Nazi propaganda, part of the link Hitler sought with Prussian militarism. By 1945, however, the quadriga was totally destroyed and the gate very battered. The city was divided and initially there were no plans for the gate, which was in the East, to be rebuilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It more than a decade before the quadriga was returned to the reconstructed gate. East Germany had been reluctant to accept a version made in West Berlin from casts taken in 1942; there had even been suggestions that new symbols should be used - a model socialist family watching a rising sun was one idea. In the end, there was only one significant alteration: because of their associations, the Iron Cross and the Prussian eagle were cut out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest restoration has restored the omissions made previously for ideological reasons. But what is the identity of the goddess in the united Berlin of 1991? Eirene or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To most people such symbolism would be meaningless. Who today ponders the symbolism of the much bigger victory arch at Hyde Park Corner in London? But in Berlin - a city where the meaning of buildings and monuments is being reassessed - it still matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Peace'' or ''victory''? No one really knows whether to love or hate the Brandenburg Gate. Perhaps there is a case for giving it back the name it was originally intended to bear: Tor des Frieden - the Gate of Peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander Duma, director of SNC Corporate Finance, has introduced the South African firm Samancor to the Albanian government, an introduction which may lead to a joint venture to mine chrome ore.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Duma, who first set foot in Albania three weeks ago, admits to one advantage over rival advisers: ''I'm Albanian.'' His father Dervish was secretary of the Albanian legation in London before Mussolini invaded Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joggers, do not remove your plimsolls. ADT, the car auctions firm which is axing its dividend, may have run out of puff. But it will still sponsor next year's marathon, director David Hammond promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American sports clothes group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is having a run of bad luck. It has already had to fork out repeatedly to the Russian pole-vaulter Sergei Bubka. It pays him a $ 50,000 bonus every time he breaks the world record. Mr Bubka breaks it often, half-inch by half-inch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, who should be ignominiously knocked out of the first round of the US Tennis Open than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> champion clothes horse Andre Agassi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Asda Group annual report thumps on to the desk. No mention of compensation for John Hardman and Graham Stow, the directors ousted in June. Their packages are almost finalised, according to finance director Ron Scott, and will appear in the next report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been less progress, it seems, on finding a new chief executive. ''Candidates are being seen,'' is all Mr Scott will volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One piece of good news is that chairman Sir Godfrey Messervy, 66, is back in the saddle after his heart attack and will chair the annual meeting next month. ''He's proving pretty robust,'' says Mr Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no chief executive to share the work, he 'Asda be (to borrow a slogan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timothy Dewhirst, chief executive of clothing supplier Dewhirst Group, is ambiguous about second-half prospects: ''If Christmas doesn't happen, then we are all in trouble. But then Christmas always happens, doesn't it?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years after he sold Van Kampen Merritt Inc. to Xerox Financial Services, and less than a month after the firm announced it was ceasing its investment banking operations, Bob Van Kampen is ready to plunge back into the municipal bond business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said yesterday that he is in the process of setting a up new firm with four former Van Kampen Merritt employees. The firm - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities -will concentrate initially on trading, underwriting, and the sale of tax-exempt and taxable bonds to institutions and retail investors, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His former firm, Lisle, Ill.-based Van Kampen Merritt, abruptly quit the municipal and corporate investment banking business on April 16 to concentrate on the development and distribution of its asset management products, including mutual funds and unit investment trusts, for individuals and institutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said discussions with some former longtime Van Kampen Merritt employees led to the decision to start a new firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three weeks ago, the last thing on my mind was to start a new business,&quot; he recalled. &quot;My intention was to help these guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said his loyalty to them was reinforced after he learned that the management at Van Kampen Merritt had called the staff into a hotel room to announce the decision to shut down the investment banking operation, and once they returned, the staff members found their desks locked and security guards posted at the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who had built that company were treated like criminals, he said. &quot;It so bothered me that I said I would do whatever I could do to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His partners in the new venture are Ron McAlister and Richard Olson, former vice presidents in institutional sales; Frank Fichera, the former head of national sales; and Scott Hall, a former first vice president of unit investment trust distribution. With the exception of Mr. Hall, the other men were members of the 80-employee investment banking group that Van Kampen Merritt discontinued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Nyberg, a senior vice president at Van Kampen Merritt, said the security procedures were in place only for 24 hours, to ensure that files were in place to &quot;protect the interests of our customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen said he has not been &quot;active&quot; in his former firm for five years. He said he thought it was a joke when he was reached on April 16 with the news that Van Kampen Merritt was discontinuing its investment banking business, effective immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Van Kampen pointed out that he had no quarrel with Xerox, saying the decision to drop the investment banking business came from Van Kampen Merritt's management and not the parent company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities would not be competing with Van Kampen Merritt, since it would be concentrating on areas the other firm has discontinued. However, he did leave open the possibility that the new firm could encroach on Van Kampen Merritt's territory in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to look at all opportunities,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nyberg concurred with Mr. Van Kampen's observation that the decision to get out of investment banking came from within Van Kampen Merritt. He mentioned that &quot;a number of former&quot; corporate bond traders and salespeople would likely be picked up by Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney Inc., another Xerox subsidiary, and that 10 other investment banking employees were reemployed in other areas of Van Kampen Merritt. He also agreed with Mr. Van Kampen that the new firm would not be viewed as competition, saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities would be dealing in the capital markets, &quot;a business (Van Kampen Merritt) decided to exit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Van Kampen said his family's trust fund was a major source of investment in the new firm, which will be privately held by the partners, he pointed out that the other partners were also coming up with capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The capital, for whatever we want to do, will be there,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the capital infusion through the trust, Mr. Van Kampen said his role as one of the partners will be to chart the direction of what he said would be a lean operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to try to get there fast, but right,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen traced his loyalty to his new partners back to the late 1970s, when they originally joined Van Kampen Merritt, saying that the firm built its base in the investment banking business with the help of those men. However, under the chairmanship of John C. Merritt, there was a change in the firm's business strategy away from the investment banking side and toward a greater concentration on asset management, Mr. Van Kampen said, adding that &quot;the tail began wagging the dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to the philosophy of life and &quot;spiritual grounding&quot; of his partners in the new venture, saying that the firm would seek &quot;like-minded&quot; people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his philosophy placed &quot;a commitment to God&quot; as the highest priority, followed by a commitment to family, and then a commitment to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If (a person's) relationship to God is healthy, and (his) marriage is happy, then you have a good employee,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities, which Mr. McAlister said was named after the Greek word for achiever, is currently operating out of Mr. Van Kampen's West Chicago office in the Chicago suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ongoing retrenchment and lack of profitability in the industry, Mr. Van Kampen was optimistic about his newest venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to the guys, 'I'm not coming out of retirement to get beat. I'm coming out to win,' &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Van Kampen began his career in municipal finance with John Nuveen &amp; Co. in 1961. In 1967, he started a bond firm called Van Kampen Wauterlek &amp; Co., which was joined by Clayton Brown six months later, he said. Seven years later, the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates. In January 1984, Van Kampen Merritt was sold to Xerox. In 1989, Mr. Van Kampen's family trust became a major investor in Fitch Investors Service Inc.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just like people, more companies are using physical fitness to stay in good shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growing trend toward the sponsorship of fitness-related events points to a healthy desire by Canadian companies to raise their profiles among conscious consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The growth in sponsorship reflects a trend through the 1980s, when the public was becoming more aware of fitness,'' says Graham Fraser, owner of TriSport Promotions Inc. of Grimsby, Ont., a promoter of triathlon events across the country. ''Ten years ago, most of our sponsors wouldn't have talked to us. Now they like to sell the fact they're associated with a fitness-related event.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some cases, boosting exposure through spectator or participant sports is a natural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Athletic-wear companies, such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., have developed multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns featuring professional athletes like football and baseball star Bo Jackson and basketball player Michael Jordan to win over aspiring athletes across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regionally, smaller promotional events, such as community coaching clinics and local sporting events, bring the corporate message closer to consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The big, international sponsorships are well known, but we try to bring to make the brand more personal by sponsoring local events, too,'' says Roy Agostino, promotions co-ordinator for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada Ltd.'s Eastern region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''This is the bread-and-butter of our business,'' says Murray Souter, vice-president of marketing at Toronto-based Reebok Canada, a division of Avrecan International Inc. ''It's much like automakers sponsoring pro car racing - we need to be involved.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For such companies, athletic sponsorships take on a practical quality. By providing top-flight athletes with their product, the shoe companies get wear-testing data and free expert design input in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for others, the connection isn't so apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, for example, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. spent more than $500,000 on sponsorship of a nationwide triathlon series in conjunction with Reebok, Toshiba and other sponsors, and plans to continue its association with the sport for another three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COMMON THEME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moncton-based Cavendish Farms sponsors a junior ski-racing program at selected resorts across the country; McKenzie Financial Corp. in Toronto does the same at Ontario resorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Crown Life Insurance Co. sponsors the Participaction Challenge, in which more than four million Canadians register 15 minutes of physical activity on a specified date each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emphasizing their commitment to local communities is a common theme among corporate sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''As an insurance company, we like people to be well,'' says Barry Francis, assistant vice-president of corporate communications at Crown Life, which spends about $500,000 on the event annually. ''But it's also a great way to enhance the image of the company. Our representatives get a higher profile in the communities where they live and work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the public-relations aspect of promoting a healthy clientele can'tbe underestimated, few sponsors would deny that they're cashing in on the high-profile nature of sports. In most cases, decision-makers look for well-advertised events with high attendance figures to get the most bang for their buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOTHING IN STONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when considering a fitness-related sponsorship, few firms will take the initiative and organize an event on their own. In most cases, the sport's national association, or a promotional company like TriSport, takes care of the organization, advertising, and promotion, while the company provides the funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though companies will often maintain an association with a particular event for several years, the value of their commitment is rarely written in stone, Fraser says. Given the current recession, therefore, some athletic events may see the level of sponsorship drop considerably over the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''One of the first things to go when times get tough is usually discretionary spending, and sponsorship often fits into that category,'' Fraser points out. ''Some companies may find it hard to justify spending a lot of money on sponsorship, but they'll still want the exposure. It'll be a tough time for anyone just getting into the game.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian retailers may be putting on a brave face but the<BR> recession-weary industry is bracing itself for yet another threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spurred on by attractive real estate deals and the need to expand beyond local markets, more and more international retailers are planning to open stores in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a recent seminar hosted by The Fashion Group International, a capacity crowd heard presentations from the four latest entrants: Talbots, Tiffany &amp; Co., Harrods and Cole-Haan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They join invaders such as The Gap, Ikea, Price Club and HMV that have succeeded with clearly defined concepts targeting specific niches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But industry studies, including a recent report by Deloitte &amp; Touche, indicate Canadian retailers do not see this trend as a threat and, in fact, are welcoming the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shirley Dawe, president of retail consultants Shirley Dawe Associates in Toronto, says Canadian retailers are ''putting their heads in the sand'' if they believe international competition will not affect their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''They've got stronger retail concepts and there's no misunderstanding about what the operations stand for,'' she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She thinks this will force Canadian retailers to ''get into the real world,'' spruce up their concepts and stress the importance of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's wear retailer Talbots plans to open three stores in Toronto in September, including a downtown outlet located on upscale Bloor St. West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hingham, Mass.-based company has a five-year international expansion plan, which began last year with a store in Toyko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Kastner, vice-president, new business, says Talbots hopes to have 15 to 20 stores in Canada by 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Canada is an important part of our international expansion plans,'' he says. ''Our research indicated the need in Toronto for classic apparel at reasonable price points.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yarmouth, Me.-based Cole-Haan, an upscale shoe retailer owned by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., is opening its first Canadian outlet, also on Bloor St. W., after studying the market for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the third international market the Yarmouth, Me.-based company has entered - it follows forays into Japan, where it operates three stores, and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cathy Taylor, vice-president, retail, says the chain was reluctant to open a store in Canada unless an ideal location became available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''I won't take on a location unless it's 100%,'' she says. ''I want an expression for Cole-Haan in a grand way. We're not a boutique but a large specialty house in it for the long run.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tiffany, the internationally renowned jewelry retailer, will open a 13,000 square-foot store in Toronto in November while Harrods International operates a small outlet in Terminal Three of Toronto's Pearson International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the free trade agreement, U.S. retailers find entering the Canadian market difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jane Baldwin, president of The Matrix Group in Toronto, said the surprises of doing business in Canada include higher taxes, real estate and labor costs that make retail prices 15% to 30% higher than in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The major companies are very sophisticated but when you first start talking to them they haven't considered Canada to be that complex,'' she says. ''In order to execute plans they need some local help to make it happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matrix, which specializes in retail locations, has been approached recently by more U.S. retailers, Baldwin said, because they are a lot more optimistic and see Canada as a key part of international expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She helped Talbots come to Canada and is now working with another ''major'' U.S. retailer interested in setting up shop in Vancouver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard Schultz, president and CEO of Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co., which has 15 outlets in Vancouver, says it's important to recognize the cultural differences between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We spent a great deal of time in planning and, as a result, we were very prepared to understand the differences in perception of the product,'' he says. ''We were highly sensitive to aligning ourselves to Canadian vendors and becoming deeply rooted in the community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other international retailers, such as Japanese department stores Sogo Co. Ltd. and Yaohan, are rumored to be looking at sites in downtown Vancouver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while there has been much speculation about Seattle-based Nordstrom coming to Vancouver, Peter Hume, a senior consultant with Thomas Consultants in Vancouver, expects Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chain to move into Vancouver or Southern Ontario first.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dallas-based consulting company, The Sports Marketing Group, the world's largest automaker was also North America's biggest corporate spender in sports in 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GM spent US$445 million in sports marketing for its auto racing programs, golf sponsorships, advertising, corporate entertainment and related expenses. ao &nbsp;&nbsp; GM chairman Robert Stempel ''pointed out that all aspects would be looked at relative to cost cutting,'' says Thomas Pyden, a spokesman for GM. ''But it is unlikely that anything immediate will be affected.'' xo &nbsp;&nbsp; GM's Buick division is ''official car'' of the PGA Tour. The 28th annual Buick Open is slated for 1992 and last year Buick added the Buick Classic and Buick Southern Open to its golf portfolio. Together the three events cost US$2.7 million in prize money alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Oldsmobile division sponsors two events on the Ladies PGA Tour offering a total of $900,000 in prize money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cadillac sponsors the ''Cadillac Series'' of Senior Tour events as well as the $1 million Cadillac Skins Game in Oakville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GM's Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions sponsor CART Racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rounding out the top five in corporate sports spending are&nbsp; Philip Morris Inc.,&nbsp; at&nbsp; US$405 million; Anheuser-Busch Cos.

Griesa, Judge) and rendered after a two week jury trial.  The jury found that appellant breached not only the parties' written agency agreement but also promises made after April 26, 1985 to remedy its alleged breach of the agreement, and that Care had suffered $ 586,868 in damages.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant airline sought reversal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York favoring appellee travel agency in appellee's breach of contract lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant airline, sued by appellee travel agency for breach of contract, appealed the judgment entered in appellee's favor. Appellant raised five grounds for relief. The court rejected all five grounds and affirmed the judgment below. The court found that the trial court did not err when it admitted parol evidence interpreting the meaning of the parties' written agreement and that appellee's continued performance after the alleged breach of the written agreement did constitute an acceptance of a new oral agreement. The court also held that appellee was legally entitled to recovery for breach of appellant's promise to cure its earlier breach and that appellant was not denied a fair trial. Finally, it held that the trial court properly presented the issue of damages to the jury. Finding no error, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment favoring appellee travel agency was affirmed. The trial court made no evidentiary errors warranting a new trial, appellee was legally entitled to recover for breach of contract under evidence it put forward that was credited by the jury, and the trial court properly submitted the issue of damages to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Contract Interpretation &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN1] In a contract action, the court's general objective should be to give effect to the expressed intentions of the parties in entering into the agreements.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Contract Interpretation &gt; Parol Evidence &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Evidence &gt; Documentary Evidence &gt; Parol Evidence</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Evidence &gt; Relevance &gt; Parol Evidence</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN2] Under New York law, if a contract is unambiguous on its face, the parties' rights under such a contract should be determined solely by the terms expressed in the instrument itself rather than from extrinsic evidence as to terms that were not expressed or judicial views as to what terms might be preferable. On the other hand, parol evidence may be admitted to explain a writing when its terms are ambiguous.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Contract Interpretation &gt; Ambiguities &amp; Contra Proferentem &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Defenses &gt; Ambiguity &amp; Mistake &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN3] Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself, and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion. Conversely, a term is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business. The determination as to whether the contract language is readily susceptible to one or more interpretations is made by the court with reference to the contract alone.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Consideration &gt; Adequate Consideration</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Consideration &gt; Sufficient Consideration</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN4] If the bargained-for performance rendered by a promisee includes something that is not within the requirements of the pre-existing duty, the law of consideration is satisfied. It makes no difference that the agreed consideration consists almost wholly of a performance that is already required and that this performance is the main object of the promisor's desire. It is enough that some small additional performance is bargained for and given.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Judicial Officers &gt; Judges &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Evidence &gt; Procedural Considerations &gt; Judicial Intervention in Trials &gt; Comments by Judges &gt; Summations</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Evidence &gt; Procedural Considerations &gt; Judicial Intervention in Trials &gt; Interrogation of Witnesses</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN5] A federal district judge is charged to see that the law is properly administered, and it is a duty which he cannot discharge by remaining inert. Rather than simply acting as moderator or mere passive spectator, a federal district judge who conducts a jury trial has the duty to see that the facts are clearly presented. In order to do so, the judge is permitted to summarize the evidence for the jury and, if he chooses, to comment on it. In addition, a judge may also interpose relevant questions to witnesses to clarify both legal and factual issues and thus minimize possible confusion in the jurors' minds.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Judicial Officers &gt; Judges &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Evidence &gt; Testimony &gt; Examination &gt; Judicial Interrogation</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Governments &gt; Courts &gt; Judges</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN6] There are recognized limitations on a federal district judge's right to actively participate in the trial. Specifically, a judge may not impose his own opinions on the jury and must avoid at all costs assuming the role of an advocate by making arguments to the jury. Finally, a trial judge is not permitted to add to the facts or present his own theories when they are not strongly grounded in the evidence.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Breach &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Contracts Law &gt; Remedies &gt; Compensatory Damages &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Torts &gt; Negligence &gt; Causation &gt; Proximate Cause &gt; Intervening Causation</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN7] Under New York law, lost profits may be recovered if it is first demonstrated with certainty that such damages have been caused by the breach. Second, the damages must be capable of proof with reasonable certainty. In other words, the damages may not be merely speculative, possible or imaginary, but must be reasonably certain and directly traceable to the breach, not remote or the result of other intervening causes. Finally, there must be a showing that the particular damages were fairly within the contemplation of the parties to the contract at the time it was made.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Trials &gt; Jury Trials &gt; Jury Instructions &gt; Objections to Instructions</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Appeals &gt; Standards of Review &gt; Plain Error &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Criminal Law &amp; Procedure &gt; Appeals &gt; Standards of Review &gt; Plain Error &gt; Definitions</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN8] Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 51, no party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection. An exception may be made only when there is plain error, that is, where the error may result in a miscarriage of justice or in obvious instances of misapplied law.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Civil Procedure &gt; Trials &gt; Jury Trials &gt; Jury Instructions &gt; General Overview</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Criminal Law &amp; Procedure &gt; Appeals &gt; Standards of Review &gt; Plain Error &gt; Definitions</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c14">Criminal Law &amp; Procedure &gt; Appeals &gt; Standards of Review &gt; Plain Error &gt; Jury Instructions</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">[HN9] A jury instruction will be deemed adequate, so long as the charge, taken as a whole, is correct and sufficiently covers the case so that a jury can intelligently determine the questions presented to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*985]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MARTIN, JR., District Judge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Pan American World Airways, Inc. (&quot;Pan Am&quot;) appeals from a judgment against it entered December 11, 1990 in the Southern District of New York, Thomas P. Griesa, District Judge, following a two-week jury trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Care Travel Company, Ltd. (&quot;Care Travel&quot;) commenced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this diversity action on March 24, 1989, alleging that Pan Am breached the parties' agency agreement which appointed appellee a Pan Am General Sales Agent and which allegedly granted appellee the exclusive right to sell Pan Am tickets from England to Karachi, Pakistan and Bombay, India. The jury found that appellant, by permitting another travel agency to sell tickets from England to Karachi and Bombay, breached the parties' written agency agreement. The jury further found that appellant made and breached promises after April 26, 1985 to remedy its alleged breach of the agreement. The jury awarded appellee $ 586,868 in damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, Pan Am argues that (1) the district court erred by admitting parol evidence that the jury utilized in interpreting the agreement; (2) Care Travel's continued performance after the alleged breach of the written agreement constituted an acceptance of a new agreement; (3) Care Travel, as a matter of law, is not entitled to recover for a breach of a promise to cure a prior breach; (4) it was denied a fair trial when the district judge introduced an erroneous theory not advanced by plaintiff; (5) and the issue of damages was not properly presented to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, Pan Am, due to its limited connections in the Indian and Pakistani communities of the United Kingdom, was interested in appointing a General Sales Agent (&quot;GSA&quot;) to market and sell airline tickets in these communities for flights to the Indian subcontinent. As a result, Peter Moss of Pan Am contacted Mr. Babu Patel and Mr. Jagdish Patel who, along with Mr. Rajinder Dugal, owned and operated Rajan Travels. The principals of Rajan Travels expressed an interest in the idea and a series of meetings followed in the spring, summer and fall of 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that time, Empire Travel was already acting as a Pan Am GSA in the United Kingdom selling tickets to the Indian subcontinent. Empire Travel operated out of Southall, Middlesex, an area west of London. Nevertheless, Care Travel claimed that during the negotiations that ensued between it and Pan Am, the appellant made it known that it wanted a single company to act as its GSA in the United Kingdom. The principals of Rajan Travels thus activated a dormant company, Care Travel, for this purpose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July of 1984, after months of negotiations, Pan Am delivered to Care Travel its standard General Sales Agency Agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (the &quot;Agency Agreement&quot;) for the latter's review. The Agency Agreement provided that Care Travel was appointed to act as Pan Am's GSA within the General Sales Territory described in Annex A to the Agency Agreement. Annex A listed Care Travel's GSA territory as &quot;London W1,&quot; an area within London. Although the standard GSA agreement provided that Care Travel would sell tickets to all of India and Pakistan, a subsequent writing memorialized the parties' agreement that Care Travel could only sell tickets to Karachi and Bombay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specification of a separate territory out of which both Care Travel (London W1) and Empire Travel (Southall, Middlesex) allegedly could operate was consistent with the regulations and resolutions of the International Association of Travel Agents (&quot;IATA&quot;), which governs relations between airlines and travel agents and which were incorporated into the Agency Agreement. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*986]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Specifically, paragraph 10 of IATA Resolution 876 provides that: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(a) when a GSA is appointed, the territory in which it may exercise the authority delegated by the appointing Member shall be clearly defined in the agreement between the parties concerned and shall in no case be smaller than a political&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  unit (i.e., country, state, province, county, town or village, or the equivalents or combination thereof) with a population at the time of appointment of not less than 10,000; any existing or subsequently established branch offices of the GSA within the defined territory shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the existing General Sales Agency Agreement; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">(b) in any one territory no member shall appoint more than one GSA.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also expressly incorporated into the parties' Agreement was a &quot;Pan American World Airways General Sales Agency Questionnaire&quot; (the &quot;Questionnaire&quot;), which Rajan Travels, on behalf of the soon-to-be activated Care Travel, was required to complete and return to appellant as part of the GSA application process. In the Questionnaire, Care Travel was asked the following questions: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">What percentage of the territory's production do you expect to be directly sold by your office? How is it composed in terms of commercial account, pleasure, government or military travel? What plans do you have to solicit each of these traffic sources:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care Travel provided a single response: &quot;All sales are through our own offices and about 250 sub-Agents at our disposal.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Questionnaire was returned to Pan Am in August of 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care Travel was due to commence business operations as a Pan Am GSA on October 1, 1984. Since Pan Am had, at that time, still not signed the Agreement, Ramon G. Evans, Pan Am's Sales Manager for the United Kingdom and Northern Europe, by letter dated September 25, 1984, wrote Jagdish Patel and confirmed various points upon which the parties had agreed. Included among the matters discussed is the statement by Pan Am that Empire Travel would be notified that, commencing October 1, 1984, it would only be permitted to sell tickets to Delhi. Further, Empire Travel would be informed that, apart from a short overlap period during which it would be allowed to honor tickets it had sold before October 1, 1984, Empire Travel would no longer be authorized to sell tickets to Bombay and Karachi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next few weeks, Pan Am forwarded to Care Travel a letter providing the fare levels for tickets from England to Bombay and Karachi and, finally, the signed Agency Agreement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, Care Travel commenced its operations in an office in London that was designed to appear as a Pan Am office. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">1&nbsp;The signed Agency Agreement was accompanied by a cover letter, previously noted, which confirmed that the parties had agreed that Care Travel would be permitted to sell tickets to Karachi and Bombay. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not long after the overlap period discussed in the September 25, 1984 letter had ended, Pan Am workers went on strike. As a result, the airline did not operate flights to India and Pakistan during February and March of 1985. After the strike ended, Pan Am, in an &quot;urgent need&quot; to recoup losses caused by the strike, sent out a letter dated April 26, 1985 (the &quot;Letter&quot;) to Care Travel and Empire Travel notifying each that henceforth, both Empire Travel and Care Travel would be permitted to sell tickets to Karachi, Bombay and Delhi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care Travel immediately objected in writing to this new policy as contrary to the understanding upon which it had agreed to become Pan Am's GSA. According to appellee, Pan Am responded by stating that the new arrangement was necessary for a short period of time in order to allow Pan Am to recoup its losses caused by the strike. In addition, Rajinder Dugal, plaintiff's majority shareholder testified at trial that Pan Am promised to terminate Empire Travel if Care Travel would, for a short period of time, continue to sell tickets in competition with Empire Travel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*987]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Dugal testified at trial that the next two and one-half-year period -- from April of 1985 until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Care Travel's termination in October of 1987 -- was marked by Care Travel's repeated complaints to Pan Am that the non-exclusive GSA arrangement was resulting in a price war between GSAs that was costing Care Travel substantial revenue. Mr. Dugal further testified that, in response to such complaints, Pan Am repeatedly assured Care Travel that the termination of Empire Travel was forthcoming. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pan Am, however, continued to do business with Empire Travel, even after that GSA filed for and emerged from bankruptcy. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">2&nbsp;While appellant points to two letters written by Care Travel to it as indicating that Care Travel, in fact, was satisfied with its relationship with Pan Am, Care Travel, on the other hand, contends that it wrote the letters at the suggestion of Pan Am in order to provide Pan Am with the documentation needed to terminate Empire Travel. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care Travel claimed that it was disappointed by this turn of events but continued throughout 1986 and 1987 to sell tickets at a loss in reliance upon Pan Am's promises to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remedy its alleged breach. In 1987, an affiliated company of Empire Travel, Sun and Sand Travel, also went into bankruptcy. Thereafter, Pan Am again notified Care Travel that it was terminating Empire Travel and, indeed, in the late summer of 1987, Empire Travel was terminated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am, however, soon after reversed course and, by letter dated October 30, 1987, provided appellee with a 90-day notice of termination. A newly formed company, Hindustan Travels, run by the Kumar family, which owned Empire Travel, was given the exclusive right to sell Pan Am tickets in the United Kingdom for routes from London to the Indian subcontinent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge submitted to the jury a series of special interrogatories that asked the jury (1) whether Pan Am appointed Care Travel to be its GSA in the United Kingdom for flights to Bombay and Karachi; (2) whether Pan Am breached this agreement; (3) whether Pan Am made a promise or series of promises to remedy its earlier breach; (4) whether Pan Am breached the subsequent promise or promises; and (5) what damages Care Travel suffered as a result. The jury answered the first four questions in the affirmative and awarded Care&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Travel $ 586,868 in damages. Judgment was entered on December 11, 1990. Pan Am subsequently moved for and Judge Griesa denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This appeal followed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISCUSSION </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We first address Pan Am's parol evidence contention. Pan Am argues that the Agency Agreement clearly and unambiguously limited Care Travel's territory to &quot;London W1.&quot; Thus, appellant contends that the district court erred in determining that the Agency Agreement was ambiguous and, as result, permitting the jury to consider parol evidence in interpreting the scope of Care Travel's agency. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">3&nbsp;Pan Am, thus, contends that its GSAs were granted the exclusive right to sell tickets in their designated territories to any destination on the Indian subcontinent. In other words, both Care Travel, within W1, and Empire Travel, within Southall, could sell tickets to Bombay, Karachi and Delhi. Interpreting the Agency Agreement in this manner, Pan Am argues that its April 26, 1985 Letter permitting both Empire Travel and Care Travel to sell tickets to Karachi, Bombay and Delhi could not constitute a breach of the Agency Agreement. The jury, however, disagreed. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since we believe that the entire integrated Agency Agreement is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation as to the scope of appellee's agency status, we find that the district court properly applied the above-discussed principles when it permitted the jury to consider extrinsic evidence to interpret the Agency Agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant argues that no ambiguity exists since the Agency Agreement clearly provides that appellee was appointed to act as Pan Am's GSA solely within the London W1 general sales territory. The IATA regulations, which appellant concedes are incorporated into the Agency Agreement, however require that GSA's defined territory &quot;in no case be smaller than a political unit (i.e., country, state, province, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  county, town or village, or the equivalents or combination thereof). . . .&quot; It seems clear that London W1 was not, as required, a &quot;political unit (i.e., country, state, province, county, town or village, or the equivalents or combination thereof).&quot; Therefore, its inclusion as the territory covered by the parties' Agency Agreement raises ambiguities which required resort to extrinsic evidence. In other words, the very term upon which appellant relies to establish the clarity of the Agency Agreement was itself ambiguous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the form contract provided by Pan Am to appellee states that the GSA's office address is indicated in Annex B. No office address is listed in Annex B. However, Annex A, the location where the London W1 territory is listed, is entitled &quot;General Sales Agency Office Addresses.&quot; Thus, it is unclear whether the London W1 referred to in Annex A was merely the address of Care Travel's office or whether it was the territory from which appellee was required to operate. The admission of evidence outside the four corners of the document was, thus, necessary to ascertain the significance of the London W1 term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Agency Agreement required Care Travel to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  maintain agents within its general sales territory. In the Pan Am Questionnaire completed by appellee, which was made part of the Agency Agreement, Care Travel refers to its general sales territory as the place where its network of 250 subagents are located. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*989]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This response appears to conflict with the provision in the Agreement limiting Care Travel's territory to London W1 and, thus, at the very least results in a further ambiguity necessitating the admission of parol evidence as a means of clarifying the parties' intent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant also argues that the lack of any provision in the Agency Agreement restricting the destinations to which Care Travel could sell tickets undercuts appellee's argument that extrinsic evidence was properly admitted to establish that Care Travel was appointed Pan Am's exclusive GSA throughout the United Kingdom for the purpose of servicing the Karachi and Bombay markets. However, in the cover letter to Care Travel enclosing the Agency Agreement signed by Pan Am, appellant confirmed the parties' agreement that appellee was appointed to service the gateways of Karachi and Bombay. This letter modified the parties' Agency Agreement since the Agency Agreement provided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Care Travel would sell to destinations in India and Pakistan and did not specify any cities within these countries. As a result, Pan Am's Sales Manager, Ramon Evans, required Care Travel to signify its agreement to this change by signing the letter and returning a copy to Pan Am. This letter, which was expressly incorporated into the parties' Agency Agreement, creates a further ambiguity that renders it impossible to glean from the instrument itself the plain intent of the parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the ambiguities discussed above, we conclude that resort to evidence outside the four corners of the Agency Agreement was necessary in order to determine whether Care Travel's agency was limited to a geographical location -- London W1 -- from which it could sell tickets or by specific markets to which it could sell Pan Am tickets. Accordingly, we find that the district court properly admitted the parol evidence regarding the parties' intent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am's next two grounds for appeal are related and, thus, will be discussed in tandem. Appellant argues that Care Travel's continued performance after the alleged April 26, 1985 breach of the Agency Agreement constituted an acceptance of a new agreement; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one in which Care Travel was no longer the exclusive Pan Am GSA for the Karachi and Bombay markets. Further, Pan Am contends that the judgment must be reversed because, as a matter of law, Care Travel is not entitled to recover for Pan Am's breach of its alleged promise or promises to cure its prior breach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to make these arguments, Pan Am assumes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">arguendo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that its April 26, 1985 letter permitting both Care Travel and Empire Travel to sell tickets to Bombay, Karachi and Delhi constituted a unilateral modification of and, thus, a termination of the parties' Agency Agreement. From there, Pan Am argues that since the parties' contract was terminable at will upon ninety days' written notice, appellee was entitled to at most only the damages suffered in this ninety day post-termination period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant further argues that, since Care Travel continued to perform under the post-April 26, 1985 arrangement, the original Agency Agreement was modified and, therefore, Care Travel waived its rights to insist on application of the parties' initial contract. Accordingly, appellant argues that Care Travel is not entitled to recover any damages under the old contract, including any &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  damages sustained during the ninety-day notice period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, Pan Am's argument is premised upon the following assumptions: that the parties' initial contract was terminable at will upon ninety-days' notice, that the contract was unilaterally modified and, thus, terminated, by Pan Am in its April 26, 1985 letter, that this termination left the parties free to form a new contract with terms that differed from those contained in the initial contract and, finally, that Care Travel's continued performance following the termination of the initial contract constituted an assent to the modification of the Agency Agreement on those terms proposed by appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am cites a number of cases which purportedly support the legal argument that if a party, notwithstanding its objection, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*990]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continues to perform under a new or changed contract, the party has accepted the modified contract and, thus, has no damage remedy arising from the modification since it has waived its right to insist on the application of the parties' initial contract.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Flint v. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 143 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1944); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Curtiss Candy Co. v. Silberman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 45 F.2d 451 (6th Cir. 1930); &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Waldman v. Englishtown Sportswear, Ltd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 92 A.D.2d 833, 460 N.Y.S.2d 552 (1st Dep't 1983); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Omega Precision Hand Tools, Inc. v. H.

La France Industries, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 274 A.D. 46, 79 N.Y.S.2d 794 (1st Dep't 1948). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact patterns found in these cases, however, are distinguishable from that found in the instant action in several important respects. Specifically, in each cited case, one party unilaterally attempted to terminate an at-will contract by insisting upon a modification of its terms. The other party then indicated its assent to the new contract by continuing to perform. Accordingly, the courts found that the assent to the modification on the terms proposed by the breaching party precluded any recovery based upon the initial agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, however, as the District Court noted, the contract between the parties provided that &quot;failure to exercise or delay in the exercising of any right under this Agreement shall not waive or otherwise prevent the enforcement or exercise of such right or any other right.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Further, the jury was presented with evidence that Care Travel objected to the terms proposed by Pan Am in the Letter and that, in response to Care Travel's objections, Pan Am repeatedly promised to restore Care Travel's position to that of exclusive GSA. Moreover, evidence was presented that Care Travel continued to perform only in reliance upon these promises. Thus, Care Travel did not waive the right to recover damages for Pan Am's breach because of its agreement; rather, Care Travel agreed to continue to perform as Pan Am's agent on a non-exclusive basis in return for Pan Am's promise to award it an exclusive right in the future. Thus, the cases cited by appellant are inapposite. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, the jury was presented with evidence that the parties' relationship was modified by the Letter. The parties differed, not surprisingly, as to the terms of that modification. Appellant, on the one hand, contended that the modification was based upon its April 26, 1985 letter which permitted both Care Travel and Empire Travel to sell Pan Am tickets to Karachi, Bombay and Delhi. Care Travel, on the other hand, contended that its assent to sell tickets on a nonexclusive basis was temporary and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conditioned on a restoration of it as Pan Am's exclusive GSA for Karachi and Bombay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this issue of fact, the issue of the terms of the Agency Agreement's modification was properly submitted to the jury. In doing so, the trial judge did not frame the issue in terms of a modification of the initial Agreement. Instead, the trial judge asked the jury whether Pan Am acknowledged its April 26, 1985 breach of the Agency Agreement by promising to remedy the breach by restoring Care Travel to its position as exclusive GSA. Further, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Care Travel performed thereafter in reliance upon, and whether Pan Am in fact breached, this alleged subsequent promise or series of promises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am objects to this theory of recovery, arguing that a promise to comply with a pre-existing legal duty is not adequate consideration upon which a valid contract may be based. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Goncalves v. Regent Intl. Hotels, Ltd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 58 N.Y.2d 206, 220, 460 N.Y.S.2d 750, 757-58, 447 N.E.2d 693 (1983); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Fafoutis v. Lyons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 149 A.D.2d 565, 566, 540 N.Y.S.2d 20, 21 (2d Dep't 1989). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the present case, however, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the parties did not simply covenant to perform their preexisting obligations. Rather, both parties did, or promised to do, something in addition to their pre-existing duties. Specifically, the parties' initial Agreement permitted Pan Am to terminate Care Travel on 90 days' notice. Evidence was presented &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*991]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that, rather than exercise its right to do so, Pan Am instead promised to terminate Care Travel's competitor, Empire Travel, in the future. In return, Care Travel temporarily agreed to operate as a non-exclusive GSA under an arrangement which, appellee argued, caused it to suffer significant economic loss. As a result of this bargained-for exchange of promises, both parties suffered detriments and bestowed benefits on the other that differed from those placed on the parties in the Agency Agreement. These differing benefits and burdens supplied the consideration necessary to support the modification. As one commentator has explained: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">. . .  [HN4] if the bargained-for performance rendered by the promisee includes something that is not within the requirements of the pre-existing duty, the law of consideration is satisfied. It makes no difference that the agreed consideration consists almost&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  wholly of a performance that is already required and that this performance is the main object of the promisor's desire. It is enough that some small additional performance is bargained for and given.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1A Corbin on Contracts &sect; 192 at 180 (1963). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">See, e.g., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Hoffa v. Fitzsimmons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 218 U.S. App. D.C. 163, 673 F.2d 1345, 1359-60 (D.C. Cir. 1982). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, Pan Am, in effect, promised Care Travel that it would not terminate their contract within 90 days, as it had an immediate right to do, but agreed to extend the length of the contract to a period of at least 90 days after the end of a reasonable period of time during which both Care Travel and Empire Travel would be operating as non-exclusive agents. Since this was different from Pan Am's pre-existing duty, we find the pre-existing duty rule inapplicable to the present situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, if there was no new consideration, Pan Am's original agreement to use Care Travel as its exclusive agent for Bombay and Karachi remained in effect. Since Pan Am did not exercise its right to terminate Care Travel by giving 90 days notice, it remains liable for the damages suffered by Care Travel as a result of Pan Am's breach of its obligation of exclusivity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a further ground for appeal, Pan Am argues that the district judge overstepped his bounds of discretion and committed reversible error when, on his own initiative, he introduced into the case the theory that Pan Am's liability could be based upon its breach of a series of promises to cure the original breach of contract. Pan Am contends that this theory of recovery had never been advanced by the parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am further argues that, in presenting this theory, the district judge improperly conveyed his personal views about the merits of the parties' claims and their witnesses' credibility. Specifically, Pan Am contends that the district judge conveyed to the jury his opinion that the testimony of plaintiff's witness, Rajinder Dugal, was worthy of belief while that of defendant's witness, Ramon Evans, was not. In effect, Pan Am argues that the district judge assumed the role of an advocate and, in doing so, deprived it of a fair trial. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read against the backdrop of these prohibitions, we find no merit to Pan Am's contentions. To begin with, Pan Am's argument that the district judge, on his own initiative, introduced a new theory of liability into the case is premised upon a series of questions the district judge asked plaintiff's main witness, Rajinder Dugal. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These questions related to alleged conversations between Dugal and Pan Am's witness, Evans, regarding promises Evans allegedly made to remedy Pan Am's breach of contract by restoring Care Travel as Pan Am's exclusive GSA for the Karachi and Bombay destinations. Pan Am contends that this series of questions provided the framework for a new theory; one never previously advanced by Care Travel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A review of the record, however, indicates that the identical line of questioning had been initially introduced by Care Travel at the outset of its case in Dugal's direct testimony. Indeed, Dugal's testimony on direct examination and in response to the district judge's questions establishes that Care Travel maintained from the commencement of the trial that it continued to act as Pan Am's GSA on a non-exclusive basis in reliance on Pan Am's repeated promises to restore the relationship to an exclusive one. Thus, the theory of recovery of which Pan Am now complains, while perhaps not articulated with precision by Care Travel, was &quot;strongly grounded in the evidence.&quot; As a result, we find that, rather than introducing a new theory, the testimony elicited by the district judge was well within the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court's duty to clarify and fully develop the relevant facts for the jury's elucidation, and to assist the jury in giving meaning to such facts by organizing them in a coherent manner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am also complains about the manner in which this allegedly new theory was presented to the jury. However, we do not believe that the district judge's mode of questioning Dugal indicated to the jury a bias on the court's part in favor of Care Travel or indicated that the judge had an opinion regarding the significance of the alleged new theory or of the credibility of the witnesses. Indeed, the sole excerpt to which Pan Am refers in support of the district judge's alleged bias evidences that the judge made clear that he supported neither parties' presentation: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">But the way I think it shapes up is this. The issue is presented by Mr. Dugal's testimony, and whether you accept his testimony or not that's up to you and I don't know whether you will or you won't, but let me put it this way, his testimony presents the following issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Did Pan American acknowledge the breach of contract and make an agreement to remedy that breach, or a series of agreements to remedy the breach? Because if you accept -- &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  again I don't know whether you will or you won't -- but if you accept Mr. Dugal's testimony that basically is the significance of it. Or you could conclude that that's the significance of it. That would be up to you. At least that's the issue: Did Pan American make an agreement or a series of agreements to remedy the breach? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Well, that obviously is a different promise than that contained in the original agreement so there is a separate issue about that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">And did Care Travel keep on acting in its capacity as the general sales agent in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[*993]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  reliance upon that promise or series of promises.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the district judge coupled this instruction with a cautionary warning that the court's statements were not evidence and that the jury -- and not the court was to make the ultimate assessment of the facts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">4&nbsp;Specifically, at the outset of his charge, the district judge instructed the jury that: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c17">I have asked more questions in this case than I would normally ask in a case to be tried by a jury, but as the case unfolded it seemed to me that there was some rather difficult issues and I felt that sometimes things were not entirely clear to me and I felt they might not be entirely clear to you, and the purpose of a trial is to make the facts clear to the jury, make the issues clear and then how the jury decides those issues on the basis of the facts is up to the jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Nothing I have said has been intended to indicate to you how you should resolve the issues before you. It has always been intended -- what I have done in the case, has been intended to draw out the facts, help to illustrate the issues in a more clear and precise way so that you can decide the answers to the ultimate questions.</SPAN></P>
<BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, having carefully reviewed the record, we find no evidence that the district judge became an advocate for any party or introduced a theory into the case not grounded in the evidence. Nor do we find any evidence that Pan Am was prejudiced by the questions and comments the court did make. Accordingly, we find Pan Am's contentions in this regard to be without merit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final errors asserted by Pan Am refer to the question of damages. Appellant first contends that Care Travel failed to meet the stricter standard of proof of damages required of a new business under the test articulated by New York's Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Kenford Co. v. County of Erie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 67 N.Y.2d 257, 261, 502 N.Y.S.2d 131, 132, 493 N.E.2d 234 (1986). Pan Am contends that without the requisite stricter proof, Care Travel's claim for damages was based on nothing more than pure speculation and, thus, the issue of damages should not have been submitted to the jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Am's argument and, thus, its reliance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Kenford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, rests on the assumption that Care Travel was a new venture. As testimony from Pan Am's own witness, John Varley, demonstrates, this assumption is misplaced. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Varley, a high-ranking Pan Am official who had been employed by appellant since 1959, testified that Pan Am was interested in having Care Travel act as its GSA in the United Kingdom due to the track record of Care Travel's principals: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">. . . they appeared to have the general expertise to represent Pan American in the United Kingdom, to sell air transportation between London Heathrow, where we operated from, to Bombay, India and Karachi, Pakistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">They had the expertise. They had the subagency network within the United Kingdom, they had particular affiliation to the ethnic and religious groups that lived both in that particular area of India and certainly Bombay and Pakistan. They had affiliations with the United Kingdom for those same groups of people and subject to a financial evaluation and credit rating from a credit agency they were seriously being considered as a future appointee to handle Pan Am sales.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Pan Am witnesses, including Evans and John McGhee, Pan Am's regional director of marketing for northern Europe, confirmed that Care Travel was selected to act as appellant's GSA due to their prior experience and the existing network of subagents they brought with &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In such a case, the stricter &quot;new business&quot; standard is inapposite to the facts of this case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Hirschfeld v.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">5&nbsp;Indeed, in his opening to the jury, Pan Am's counsel stated that &quot;Care Travel consists of three directors, all of whom have been in the travel agency business for well over 20 years, and in fact they boasted that they created the concept of an ethnic GSA and they said they would be your GSA.&quot; Although not evidence, this statement is further indication that Pan Am itself did not consider Care Travel a &quot;new business&quot; in the same sense as the term was discussed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Kenford, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Specifically, Care Travel, relying in part upon appellant's own reports, presented evidence as to the actual sales made by both Care Travel and Empire Travel during the April 1985-January 1988 period for the Bombay, Karachi and Delhi routes. Care Travel then applied to this figure an estimated percentage of sales to the Indian subcontinent attributable to only the Karachi and Bombay routes, since those were the destinations to which Care Travel claimed a contractual exclusive. In doing so, appellee again relied on Pan Am's own documents. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Care Travel then calculated a commission rate that it would have earned as an exclusive GSA and applied this rate to the sales figures for the Karachi and Bombay markets.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">7&nbsp;In fact, the $ 9 million figure arrived at by Care Travel for the total sales volume that one Pan Am GSA servicing Bombay and Karachi on an exclusive basis would have achieved was more conservative than the $ 10-12 million figure contained in Pan Am's own internal documents. Specifically, Mr. Witt, a Pan Am official, wrote: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Empire/Care/Cambata will all promise 10 to 12 million [dollars] if they are given the GSA on an exclusive basis, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">I feel sure</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> with the right conditions of allocation and blind eye to some degree of malpractice this would be true.</SPAN></P>
<BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">8&nbsp;Given Care Travel's damage proof, the jury was supplied with a &quot;basis for multiple mathematical calculations capable of determining with some specificity the financial repercussions of [defendant's] breach.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Lexington Products, Ltd. v.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant takes issue with the two major assumptions or estimations made by Care Travel in its damage calculations; namely that Care Travel, if it had been the exclusive GSA, would have received a 12% commission and would have sold all of the Pan Am tickets sold by Empire Travel to Karachi and Bombay. The mere fact that appellant disagrees with the methodology utilized by Care Travel in arriving at its 12% commission rate or Care Travel's assumption that all of Empire Travel's sales to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*995]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Karachi and Bombay would have neatly transferred to Care Travel does not render Care Travel's proof speculative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Pan Am, and the trial judge, vigorously challenged and Care Travel defended the assumptions underlying its damage proof. With respect to the 12% commission rate, Pan Am argued that the correct figure that should have been applied was the actual 2.67% profit margin Care Travel obtained during the October 1984-April 26, 1985 period prior to the alleged breach. In response, Care Travel's damage witness presented a reasonable explanation as to why this figure was rejected as irrelevant. Specifically, the witness explained that the time period during&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the 2.67% return was obtained included the overlap period during which both of Pan Am's GSAs were selling tickets to the same destinations. Accordingly, the witness explained that since Care Travel was not acting on an exclusive basis during this period, the 2.7% did not establish the proper profit margin for an exclusive Pan Am GSA. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the tickets that Care Travel would have sold had it been the exclusive GSA, Pan Am's witness, Ramon Evans, testified that, in his &quot;personal belief,&quot; 100% of Empire Travel's sales to Bombay and Karachi would not have been transferred to Care Travel. Mr. Evans theorized that the entry of two GSAs competing for sales to the same destinations expanded the market to these destinations and, thus, without such competition Care Travel would have sold less tickets as an exclusive GSA than it did in competition with Empire Travel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the trial, Judge Griesa similarly and quite vigorously challenged Care Travel's witness on his assumption that all of the tickets that Empire Travel sold to Bombay and Karachi would have been sold by Care Travel. Indeed, in response to the trial judge's line of questioning, Care Travel's damage witness, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mark Pickering, conceded that the price war between Care Travel and Empire Travel could have increased sales volume and that, absent the price war, sales may have been less than it was when both GSAs were competing. In addition, the trial judge's questions to Pickering suggested that Care Travel might not have captured all of Empire Travel's sales since the two GSAs did not utilize all the same subagents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admittedly, Care Travel's responses to these challenges were not completely convincing. However, the alleged inadequacy of the responses does not make Care Travel's damage proof speculative. Rather, given the extent of Care Travel's damage proof, we believe that the trial court was well within the proper bounds to submit the damages issues to the jury.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">S &amp; K Sales Co. v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19"> Inc., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 816 F.2d at 853; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">F.H. Krear &amp; Co. v. Nineteen Named Trustees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 810 F.2d 1250, 1260 (2d Cir. 1987). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Care Travel's damage presentation concluded with a request for $ 970,846.00. The jury awarded Care Travel $ 563,858.00. The compromise nature of the verdict gives rise to an inference that the jury considered both parties' arguments and attempted to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrive at a reasonable estimate of appellee's damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we deal with Pan Am's objections to the propriety of the damage instruction given to the jury. Pan Am claims that the charge as it related to damages lacked the clarity required to give the jury an adequate understanding of the law and how it should be applied to the evidence. The appellant specifically cites the trial court's failure to inform the jury that, if liability was found, the damages plaintiff was seeking were its lost profits, the court's failure to discuss how lost profits should be calculated and, finally, the court's failure to inform the jury that it may not speculate in awarding damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN8] Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, &quot;no party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto . . . stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection . . .&quot; An exception may be made only when there is &quot;plain error,&quot; that is, &quot;where the error may result in a miscarriage of justice or in obvious instances of misapplied law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Earl v.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*996]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this case, the Court spent a great deal of time discussing the charge with counsel and seeking their input. Despite ample opportunity to raise objections to the charge, counsel did not raise the issues they now press on appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conference prior to submission of the charge, Judge Griesa explained in detail how he would instruct the jury to calculate damages if they deemed such an award proper: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">If they find a breach of promise or breach of contract, they will be entitled to consider the damages as a question of fact considering it, however -- and this is very important for the plaintiff because I don't want to have to contradict you -- they have to consider it in terms of what were the damages, if any, flowing from a breach of contract. That is not the same as saying what would my profits have been during the time I was performing a contract. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">In other words, if they find that Evans promised to remedy the breach and failed to keep that promise what damages flowed from that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">In other words, I will tell the jury the standard is what do they find as a fact that Care would have been entitled to make had Evans kept his promise. That is not the same as finding what would Care's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**41]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  profit have been during the time of this promised arrangement. I think you can argue it but it's not the same and you'll have to be careful about that.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant objected only to the extent of arguing that damages should be limited to the 90-day notice period and arguing that Care Travel was a new business and, therefore, in awarding damages, the jury must avoid speculation because &quot;to measure damages for that type of entity is much stricter than if it was an ongoing business that had a history.&quot; As the above discussion of those issues demonstrates, the Court properly rejected these instructions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant did not specifically object to the trial court's determination that the recoverable damages were not necessarily &quot;lost profits.&quot; Accordingly, appellant's current objections to the damage instructions were not preserved for appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Kelco Disposal, Inc. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 845 F.2d 404, 409 (2d Cir. 1988). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, we find the district court's charge adequate even if the &quot;plain error&quot; standard of review is not applied. If such a standard is not applied,  [HN9] a jury instruction will be deemed adequate, so long as the charge, taken as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**42]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a whole, &quot;is correct and sufficiently covers the case so that a jury can intelligently determine the questions presented to it.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Fernandez v.

United States Lines Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 324 F.2d 126, 127 (2d Cir. 1963)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**43]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (charge sufficient if it assures a party &quot;a fair consideration of all his theories&quot;). Thus, perfection is not expected.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Evans v. Transportacion Maritime Mexicana SS &quot;Campeche</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;, 639 F.2d 848, 860 (2d Cir. 1981). Moreover, a trial court has discretion in the style and wording of jury instructions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Franks, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 324 F.2d at 127. Accordingly, the court is not obliged to use the exact words proposed by a party.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Pullman, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 662 F.2d at 917. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applying the above principles to our review of the record convinces us that the trial judge's damage instructions adequately reflected the pertinent law and enabled the jury to decide the issues intelligently. The court's charge instructed the jury to ask &quot;what loss did Care suffer from the breach of contract, if it occurred&quot; and &quot;what would Care have gained had the contract or the promise been carried out.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*997]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Transcript, p. 571. The charge also informed the jury that &quot;you are trying to . . . put Care into the position it would have been had the promise or contract been carried out.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the Court reminded the jury that, although &quot;there is really no way of knowing to a certainty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**44]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what the [damages are],&quot; nevertheless: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">you are not left totally in the dark by any means. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">You've got a lot of evidence about what Pan Am's business was there, what sales ability Care Travel had in the United Kingdom in its market. You have a lot of evidence about the stability of Care Travel and any related companies as business entities. This is not a situation where the Care Travel people were about to fail or something like that.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, as appellant requested, the trial court instructed the jury that, <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">in making a reasonable estimation . . . you can consider, among other things, the right of Pan American to terminate on 90 days' notice but you can also consider whether Pan Am, if they had carried out their promise, if you find there was a breach of the promise, you can consider what would Pan Am have done had they carried out the promise. It is a factual question for you, which you can reasonably appraise. Had they given Care the exclusive right to sell to these gateways, would they have terminated Care in 90 days' notice? It is a factual question for you. Or would they have gone on for some reasonable period of time dealing with Care on an exclusive basis.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, while &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**45]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury was not specifically instructed that it should refrain from speculation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the charge guided the jury on how to use the evidence to calculate a damage award. In short, we find that the charge, taken as a whole, &quot;adequately acquainted the jurors with appellant's theory of the case,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Fernandez v. Fitzgerald, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 711 F.2d at 488, and allowed the jury to make an informed, reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by Care Travel. Accordingly, we reject appellant's challenges to the jury instructions. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">9&nbsp;As noted above, appellant did not ask for a general charge that the jury should not refrain from speculation. This language was raised solely in the context of Pan Am's flawed argument that Care Travel was not a new venture. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY'S Tweed Valley triathlon will have some of the big names from the Gold Coast missing, but organisers of the event say they are not too concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many top Gold Coast triathletes have chosen to compete at Taree or in the second race of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> series in Sydney.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Tweed Valley race organisers, John Hanley, said they had close to 300 nominations, with the race growing in popularity for the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole event is aimed at the average triathlete and not for the big names who chase the big purses,&quot; Hanley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tweed Valey triathlon carries $2,000 in prize money, with $300 going to the open male winner,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Triathletes start and finish at the Murwillumbah Rowing Club after swimming 1,500m in the Tweed River, cycling 40km past Chillingham, and then running 10km through the sugar cane fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both the cycle and run legs take the triathletes through the main street, so spectators are well looked after,&quot; Hanley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's winner, Miles Stewart, has not been nominated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father and manager, Col Stewart, said Miles - who won the first race of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> series on the Gold Coast last weekend - would either compete at Taree or in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tweed Heads-based triathlete Mike Doyle, who won the Tweed race in 1989, will be looking to break his course record of 1:55.11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His training partner, Glenn Forbes, from Benora Point, is another definite starter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forbes is preparing for the national long-course championships in South Australia next February, followed by the Canberra Sri Chimori Triathlon a week later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The triathlon has six divisions, with the over-45s and women's sections strongly supported. Last year's female winner - Liz Hepple, of the Gold Coast- returns today, with Ipswich's Trevor O'Brien looking for a hat-trick of wins in the over-45s.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they can't be safe at school, where can they be safe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A distressed Mr Emanuel Alexis was speaking after a playground brawl which left one of his sons, George, 19, in hospital with a broken jaw and fractured skull.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His other son Con, 17, has a cut face and a black eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brawl erupted at Glebe High School about 11 am yesterday after six gang youths came into the playground and allegedly threw a metal garbage bin at a Year 12 student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George and Con went to help the student, and the scuffle escalated to a brawl within seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Year 10 student, who did not want to be named, said he had seen George fall to the ground convulsing after he was kicked in the head by one of the gang members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His head hit the pavement and I just heard this crack. I went over to him and pulled his tongue from the back of his mouth because he wasn't breathing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing happened so quickly it's hard to say what really caused it... we just thought the gang was trying to roll them for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Airs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two teachers and a clerical assistant tried to break up the fight and detain the gang members until the police arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ambulance spokesman said nine people had been taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the Children's Hospital, Camperdown, including the two teachers and clerical assistant. Several others were treated at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Year 10 student, Brad Leung, also saw the fight. He said the gang members were wearing black and blue bandanas favoured by a local gang called the City Crew Cribs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brad, 17, said that Glebe High students were involved in rumbles with local standover gangs &quot;at least once a week&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Usually all they want are your Reeboks or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to the principal of Glebe High, Mr Pat Kidd, the attack was an isolated incident which had been &quot;blown out of proportion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tim Mack, the father of an injured Year 12 student, agreed. &quot;There are rough heads wherever you go ... it's just a fact of life,&quot; he said. &quot;These kids are nearly 18: you can't keep them at home until they are 50 to protect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister for School Education, Mrs Chadwick, yesterday commended the school staff for their &quot;courage&quot; in acting swiftly to protect students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brawl will be the subject of a full Department of Education investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late last night, one person, a 19-year-old, had been charged with assault. Another two youths were being detained for questioning and police were still scouring the area for three other suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charged youth was released on bail to appear in Balmain Local Court on March 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brawl is at least the third serious violent incident in Sydney schools in the past 13 months. In February last year, eight teenagers were injured in a battle between 60 students from Blacktown Boys' High and Patrician Brothers School. Seven months later, a 15-year-old student at Epping Boys' High stabbed another Year 10 student with a 10-centimetre knife during a scuffle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE two-match series against Czechoslovakia is going to be a huge test for the Socceroo side being assembled by new national coach Eddie Thomson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That warning came from Socceroo veteran Paul Wade as the countdown starts to the first internationals of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wade made his international debut against the Czechoslovakians in 1986 and has no doubts they will mean business when they arrive. &quot;In '86, they turned up in the morning and were still good value in a 1-1 draw when they played us the same day after the long flight from Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;They tore us apart in the later games, thrashing us 3-0 in the game in Sydney.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They were so fit and so good on the ball, they didn't give you time to close down. If we let them get control, they might not let us get a touch of the ball for 90 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't say that to scare anyone - I just think it is the preparation we need for finding the squad which can cope with international competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the internationals are something to look forward to, Wade is still basking in the glory of scoring one of the best goals of the season to give South Melbourne a 1-0 win over Melita Eagles last weekend.The midfielder ran on to a lay-off from Paul Wade to hit a scorcher on the volley into the top corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My calling for the ball has become known as the 'Wadey scream' around the club and I made one of them as I ran forward while Paul had two or three players bearing down on him,&quot; Wade said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I didn't have time to control as the lay-off came and it could have ended in the Middle Park lake but I hit it sweetly.&quot; The effort and Wade's midfield performance has earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some of our supporters weren't too happy with our performance but we came up against a good side in Melita,&quot; Wade said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They made us look ordinary in the first half but I felt we turned up the heat as the game wore on. We deserved both points.&quot; Wade feels his good performance was helped by his move to central midfield - and is hoping to hang on to the position at least for another week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mike Petersen, Steve Tasios and myself all prefer the central midfield spot because of the added freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petersen and Tasios were missing through illness last week but are expected to be back jostling for the spot for this weekend's trip to Adelaide City.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE lure of European soccer is among the main reasons behind Ivan Kelic's rise among the top scorers of the National Soccer League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic is the third highest scorer, with 10 goals in 15 games, and providing he keeps up the average, he should at least double his NSL career tally of 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is one of the tall strikers in the league and, with partner Frances Awaritefe, used his aerial skill to break down Sunshine's rearguard at the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His efforts have earned him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-Sun </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Golden Boot award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the winner he receives a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air runners retailing at $280.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic harbors the desire to finish the season at the top of the scorers list to give him added ammunition for his ulterior aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd love to do it (be top scorer), but the main aim is to help Melbourne Croatia finish in the top three and then have a serious go at winning the league in the championship play-offs,&quot; he said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His confidence comes from a trip with the combined Melbourne-Sydney Croatia team to Europe to play five games against the likes of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb in the NSL close season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was virtually scoring in every game and once I was able to do so against overseas players, I knew I had the capability to approach the NSL confidently,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unexpected reward from the trip was an invitation from Hajduk to spend time with the club pre-season this coming July-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Vedran Rozic, the former coach of Sydney Croatia, is now the vice-president at Hajduk and he had a chat with me and invited me to give him a call at the end of our season,&quot; Kelic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelic believes this is Melbourne Croatia's best ever chance of winning the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we don't win it now, I don't know if and when the club will come close to it again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GREATER control over his playing career and a change of direction in future plans have brought about Craig Foster's imminent transfer to Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The midfielder yesterday received the signed contract and the flight tickets to go to Singapore on April 2, only a day after he completes his NSL commitments with Sunshine George Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foster is buying his own contract from Sunshine for $15,000 to have a higher degree of control on his playing future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've signed to play for Singapore between May and October but if the team qualifies for the finals it could extend to December,&quot; Foster said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And I don't want to get into the same trouble that Alistair Edwards and Abbas Saad got into, with Sydney Olympic putting the pressure on them to return prematurely.&quot; Foster is one of the three imports allowed to play for Singapore's national side, which competes in the Malaysian national league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He first made contact with the team while flying back from a stint in Germany and the Singapore FA has been chasing his signature for the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before his Singapore mission, there is the job in hand, and that is to get as many points for bottom side Sunshine in the remaining five weeks of the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rescue mission does not look as impossible after the 5-0 away win against Sydney Croatia last Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORGET the tennis - one of the most constantly asked questions as the countdown to Wimbledon hits top gear is &quot;just what will Andre Agassi be wearing?&quot; Not since Gussie Moran outraged the establishment with her lace pants in 1949 has fashion been so prominent in pre-Wimbledon discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Agassi licks his wounds over losing last week's French Open final to fellow American Jim Courier, it seems almost everyone else is licking their lips in anticipation of what the luminous lad from Las Vegas will turn out in when he makes his much-anticipated Wimbledon return in 11 days time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So just what will Agassi, or rather his sponsors, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, come up with for the All England Championships, which start on Monday week? The man himself is not saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,&quot; Agassi said when asked in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The word, according to one media hound, is that the Las Vegas showman will turn out for his first match in classical white from his headband down to his cycling shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After that, he said, Agassi was likely to introduce a lightly colored outfit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports this week said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, after discussing designs with Agassi, had been putting alternatives to the All England Committee and referee Alan Mills for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, admits that officials do not think it right to stipulate any percentage of white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A very small amount of psychedelic coloring can be off-putting, while a pastel-colored shirt could be perfectly acceptable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We feel - and I think the players feel too - that this is one of our better traditions.&quot; - AAP</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passing through New York a month before her Australian counterpart, Ms Richardson spoke at length about her government's fiscal reform and deregulation of the labour market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She happily told bankers and investment specialists that her government was the maker of economic miracles, while the country's high unemployment was the fault of her political predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are impressed,&quot; one American analyst told a smug Ms Richardson, who conceded she ought to consider retirement now while she was at the peak of her political career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few thousand unemployed Kiwis would probably agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in no mood for a marathon. The athletic footwear company - whose advertisements feature basketball superstar Michael Jordan - is sprinting to the lead in the earnings race in what has become a very lucrative market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has just reported a 15 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings to a record $US114.4 million. US sales rose 5 per cent for the quarter and Wall Street is bullish about the company's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But troubled rival L.A. Gear is fading fast as mounting financial troubles are complicated by shrinking credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After becoming the third largest shoemaker in the US in four years, the company has losses of more than $US4 million and was recently bought by Mr Stanley Gold, a shrewd Californian known for restoring troubled companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, there are whispers that the company may soon be known as L.A. Disappear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louise Fairfax broke through for her first win in the women's section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews led the 79 starters from the start and completed the 500m swim, 5km run and 18km cycle sections in 51m31s - a race record.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devonport's Scott Russell was second, 2m11s behind Matthews. He was followed by Devonport's Glen Fairbrother (55.09), Launceston's Grant Titmus (56.06) and coastal athletes Darren Turner (56.12) and Doug Watts (56.13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairfax was 10th after the swim and run but faded in the cycle to finish in 1.03.39 in 25th place overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She finished well in front of second placegetter Margaret Taplin (1.08.36). Then came Megan MacPherson (1.09.25), Bernadette Matthews (1.13.35), Michelle Carrington-Smith (1.14.02) and Ellen Whinnett (1.16.03).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State champion Matthews was first out of the water, swimming the 500m in 7m49s, which included the swim-run transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was followed by junior Jason Hawke (7.52), Malcolm Wells (8.04) and northern tennis star Andrew Youl (8.16).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews then took off in the run to open a commanding 1m24s lead over Scott Russell, who had moved from seventh after the swim to second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was followed into the run-bike transition by Malcolm Wells, a further minute back. He led a pack of seven athletes, including Fairfax, who had moved from 23rd after the swim into 10th with one of the fastest run splits of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the bike, Matthews extended his lead by 48 seconds over Russell to win the first race in the $5000 three-race series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Fairfax and Matthews won a pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Pegasus running shoes worth $160 and $70 cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first veteran (40 and over) was Jeff James (57.47), who was ninth overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a three-way battle in the junior section. Legana's Andrew Bridle finished on top, coming 16th overall in 1.01.16. He was followed by Tony Byron (1.02.10) and Burnie's Michael Lee (1.03.18).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youl was 13th overall in 59.56 while North Launceston footballer David Martin was 62nd overall in 1.13.31 in his triathlon debut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second race in the series will be held on January 12 with the third race on March 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in virginal all-white on Centre Court this weekend - has revealed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">how drink and drugs threatened to claim his explosive talent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before he discovered religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agassi, three times a finalist in his past three Grand Slam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tournaments, who went on to win his rain-interrupted lead-up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">match, sat with girlfriend Wendy Stewart at his side and said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have experienced drugs and excessive drinking.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What did he drink? &quot;Everything,&quot; he says. &quot;At times, I could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drink without stopping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 13, he was enrolled at Nick Bollettieri's famous Tennis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academy in Florida - a world away from his Las Vegas roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agassi confesses: &quot;I used to rebel against everything. I grew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">my hair long because school said you couldn't have it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drank wine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the guys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I got to drinking wine when I hung out with the other academy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guys. I enjoyed it just because you weren't supposed to. I also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smoked pot, oh sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After being given a new chance by Bolettieri to make good,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one other change of direction proved crucial: He turned to God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One of my friends, a kid who was rather wild, became a Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He invited me to a Bible study group. I was prepared to give</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it a chance. I had seen the damage the other stuff, drugs and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drink, could do. I'd seen a few friends go completely wrong- and I was worse than them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another break came with sportswear manufacturers </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to meet some expenses, offering $20,000 for one year, with $25,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the second. It was all the money in the world to Andre in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those days. He's now on a multi-million dollar contract with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The company bought him; he sells it, enlivening tennis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boris Becker, three times Wimbledon champion, sums it up: &quot;I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">don't agree with Agassi's pink shorts, or his strange hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not normal. But thank God he's different. He's very good for tennis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Welch, Brad Beven and Stephen Foster, who completed an Australian trifecta at last year's world championships in Orlando, Florida, are expected to dominate the $50,000 Isle of Palms Resort David Hawkins Memorial Triathlon at Elanora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the wildcard will be a killer hillclimb on KP McGrath Dve during the cycle leg which will be the make or break point for the top class field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competitors will tackle &quot;&quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot; five times during the 40km bike leg in one of the country's toughest triathlon tests, which also counts as the national Olympic distances championships, the interstate teams championships and the selection trial for the world championships on the Gold Coast on October 13.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welch has earned favoritism for the men's event through his world championship victory and three runaway wins after missing the first round of this year's four-race </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sprint series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Sydney star will be pressured by Cairns-based Beven, second in Orlando and the competitor most likely to handle the expected heat in an event which will not finish until after noon today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Olympic cycling representative Liz Hepple should find the course to her liking in the women's event and will start favorite ahead of hometown hope Bianca van Woesik and dark horse Donna Gould, Australia's 1984 Olympic 3000m track runner whose swim leg is the big question mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public race will start at 6.30am today, while the elite open section begins at 10.30am over a 1.5km swim leg in the lagoon around the Isle of Palms, the 40km bike ride and a 10km run over a five-lap circuit around the streets of Elanora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime areas for spectators will be the bike climb on KP McGrath Dve, and a second climb on Avacado St followed by a steep descent on which the riders are expected to reach speeds of more than 80km/h. Leading chances in the event are._ Greg Welch (NSW). Won the world championship in Orlando, Florida, last year to gain the world No 1 ranking. Runaway winner of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sprint series this year despite missing the first leg of the four-race series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brad Beven (Qld). Runner-up to Welch in Orlando and an outstanding swimmer. With be right up with the lead going into the bike leg and should be hard to run down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Foster (Vic). The third leg of Australia's 1-2-3 finish in Orlando, but most likely to suffer from the heat during the killer bike leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Stewart (Qld). Has a big advantage through his local knowledge and training on the course. Won the first leg of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> series in Welch's absence and the man most likely to challenge the top three seeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Croft (Qld). Experienced competitor who will captain the Queensland team in this event. Top swimmer who will battle with Beven to be first out of the water going into the bike leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women: Liz Hepple (Qld). Olympic cyclist who finished third in the 1988 women's Tour de France. A dominant force since switching to triathlons and named the 1990 Triathlete of the Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bianca van Woesick (Qld). Gold Coaster with local knowledge advantage. An up-and-comer who has been one of the big improvers this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michellie Jones (NSW). One of the rising stars on the women's triathlon scene. Has surprised many observers with her commanding form this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louise Bonhan (NSW). Former Triathlete of the Year who suffered horrendous injuries in a bike accident during training in 1989. On the comeback trail and has outstanding cycling credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Pickard (WA). A real swim specialist and another former Triathlete of the Year. At one stage Pickard and Bonhan dominated women's triathlon, and both are making comebacks this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Gould (NSW). Wildcard competitor who ran the 3000m at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Took up cycling after an injury and represented Australia at the Auckland Commonwealth Games.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the top female runners in the Tampa Bay area ventured to Fort Lauderdale last weekend for the Alamo Heart Run 10K, where $ 20,000 in prize money awaited.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbara Jarnagin of Oldsmar and Vicky Renner of Clearwater found a field laden with national-class runners, including marathon champions and three former Olympians. Still, the two distinguished themselves among 647 women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jarnagin, 25, a recreation supervisor at the Long Center of Clearwater, placed fifth with a time of 35 minutes, 11 seconds, winning $ 500. She outran one of the Olympians: Ena Weinstein of Peru, who beat Jarnagin by eight seconds with a time last July in Lakeland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winner of the women's Heart Run was Liz McColgan of Scotland and Gainesville. She owns the world 10K record of 30:38.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner, a 5K specialist, moved up to 10K for the Heart Run and took 18th place in 40:11. She was coming off a 17:38 5K win at the Super Bowl Sunday Run.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Gasparilla women's preview: Jarnagin will have formidable state competition in the Gasparilla 15K in Tampa on Saturday.  n n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy Mercon of Clearwater powered her way to a 55:48 in the heat last year to finish third among Florida women. She will be back and is running better than ever.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jean Pare, an M.D. from Gainesville, was the second Florida finisher and 10th overall last year, in 53:01.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diane Bussa, a Gainesville resident who competed last year as Diane Brewer, ran a 51:18 to place fourth among women and first among those from the Florida.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-place money for women and men at Gasparilla is $ 10,000.  The early favorite is last year's winner, Judi St. Hilaire of Fall River, Mass.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasparilla men's preview: The top three from the area last year were Dror Vaknin of Tampa, Peter Maher of St. Petersburg and Toronto, and Tom Swiersz of St. Petersburg. Chris Bloor of Seminole would be a candidate to move up in the standings he was 49th overall last year but is coming off a marathon race in Houston.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiersz and Bloor will team up for the Forerunners with Gary Peters, Gary Bingham and high school standout Brian Herring to challenge for the Florida Team Cup.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday. The sun punches through slightly drawn curtains, birds are chirping on the patio, jazz piano plays on the stereo.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Fred Dyles' day to himself, a release from high school basketball, from coaching Gibbs, the marquee team in Pinellas County&nbsp;with 29 wins and just two losses, with three senior stars headed for Division I universities, a favorite in its division of the state tournament.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the way I relax,&quot; said Dyles, whose leisure clothes include a blue sweatshirt with &quot;Gladiator basketball&quot; on the left chest and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coaching shoes he wears at practices. &quot;Of course, I go fishing quite a bit. And there are other things too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the phone rings.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Teal, Gibbs' point guard and one of those three seniors, is several hours from boarding a plane for his official visit to the University of Arkansas, and he is calling Dyles for last-minute advice.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles talks like a concerned father: &quot;Are you going to wear that new track suit? You better dress warm because it's cooler up there.&nbsp; Do you have enough money?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no getting away from the game. He has done these same things at the same school for 27 years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles relationship with his players is more than just basketball.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972 when Dan Wright's mother died, Dyles drove him to Valdosta, Ga. For the two weeks after her death, Wright stayed with Dyles.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm their father, their brother and their best friend,&quot; said Dyles, married for 10 years and stepfather to two children. &quot;If they have a problem or need some help or something, I want to know about it. I guess I was put on this earth to work with children.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little more to it than that.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has won 544 games (third among active coaches in Florida) and three state championships and coached numerous college prospects. (Along with Teal this year, the other Division I prospects are Dwight Brown and Pat Lawrence.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles' career began during the civil rights movement and the subsequent integration of state schools, and Gibbs was St.  Petersburg's predominant black high school team. In 1966, his team won the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association (FIAA) crown for all-black schools; in 1967, Gibbs won the Florida High School Activities Association (FHSAA) championship in the school's first season of integrated athletics.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Winning back-to-back titles, it was real special,&quot; said Elbert Crumb, a player on those teams and now the head basketball coach at Osceola. &quot;It was black versus white, but that talk never entered the locker room. Coach (Dyles) didn't allow that.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His approach was that you had to be twice as good,&quot; said Wright, a 1972 Gibbs alumnus and now the Lakewood coach, &quot;the same as it is in the real world.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles graduated from Gibbs in 1951. Although a military obligation (from 1954 to 1957) split his collegiate career at Florida A&amp;M, Dyles returned and was an All-American during his junior and senior years. After graduation, Dyles began teaching at 16th Street Junior High in St. Petersburg and was also an assistant basketball coach.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;When 16th Street coach Sidney Campbell got sick at midseason, Dyles became the interim coach. &quot;When Sidney got well, he came to me and said that he was a football coach and that he'd recommend me for the job,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;I've been rolling ever since.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three years, 16th Street's basketball team was undefeated (96-0) and won three junior high school state championships. And when his ninth-graders at 16th Street graduated to Gibbs in 1964, Dyles returned to his alma mater with them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of segregation, Gibbs was St. Petersburg's only all-black high school and its athletic teams competed in the FIAA. During his first two seasons, Gibbs made the FIAA's semifinals and won the 1966 state title.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You just couldn't imagine how much talent was there,&quot; said Dyles, referring to the competition in the FIAA. &quot;Because you could only keep 15 players, there was some good talent left off our team. I welcomed integration (court-ordered for Pinellas County in 1972) because it allowed more players an opportunity to play.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By fall 1966, Gibbs became the first all-black school integrated into the FHSAA. Later that year, the two associations (FIAA and FSHAA) merged.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles remembers FHSAA executive secretary Floyd Lay warning him and former Gibbs principal Emmanuel Stewart of racial prejudices his team might experience.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lay told me what people would say,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;Sure, some people said some things, but I had my troops ready. In fact, I think that we were treated better then than we are now. That's because they (FHSAA officials) wanted it (integration) to work so bad.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But long before the FHSAA integrated, Dyles did. He and former Dixie Hollins coach Roy King conducted secret Saturday practices.  At the time, Dixie Hollins was an all-white school.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'd hide our cars, lock up in his gym and scrimmage like hell for a couple of hours,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;We just got tired of scrimmaging against our own people. He wanted to be ready for the Clearwaters and the Dunedins.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dyles has seen the changes in basketball the athleticism of the players, the equipment and the three-point shot but that hasn't altered his teams' style of play or the message for his players.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I try to teach a guy not to quit,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;If his family needs food, I don't want him to go hide with his tail between his legs. I want him to be able to go out and get his family some food.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that responsibility, Dyles' system also provides for freedom of expression.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've always been an advocate of what they call the run-and-gun or street ball. I played that way in high school,&quot; said Dyles, who was coached by Joe Johnson. &quot;I always said he (Johnson) was 30 years ahead of his time. But as soon as my white counterparts started doing this, they called it a transition game.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles' program has been blessed with athletes, but he said his goal is to make them total players.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've always stressed conditioning, then have taught players dribbling skills and low-post players the dropstep,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;For example, Bill Teal might make a pass to Pat between his legs, but that's fundamentals. He knows where his teammates are, it's just that his pass has a little extra on it.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his success, Dyles has never been asked or invited to coach a state all-star game. But that hasn't hurt his credibility with his peers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think that you see lots of coaches come and go,&quot; said FHSAA state basketball chairman and Port St. Lucie coach Ed Kershner, &quot;but he's stood the test of time. Staying with the game, changing with the players and being a coaches' coach is a tribute to the man.  With all the talent that he's coached, he's brought recognition to the state of Florida.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pinellas County, Dyles' coaching influence lives. He coached both of the county's other two black boys basketball coaches Osceola's Crumb and Lakewood's Wright.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a game, Dyles is wide-eyed, leaning toward the court from his seat on the bench.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a whistle blows stopping play, Dyles waits for the official's call. If he disagrees with it, he'll let it be known.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His motto to his players best describes his personality: &quot;Fight the battles on the court and I'll take care of everything else.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dyles' outspoken nature has been costly. During the past three seasons, he has been fined three times by the FHSAA for criticizing officiating in the media.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Gibbs, Dyles' actions aren't questioned but appreciated.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a game, Dyles draws a bigger crowd than his three stars, Teal, Brown or Lawrence. No matter the outcome, admirers offer congratulatory handshakes and pats on the back.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past several seasons, Dyles has coached amid speculation that he would retire. Since he loses three starters after the season, the talk has intensified.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dyles is quick to deny such comments. &quot;Are you kidding?

But Dyles offers his perspective.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, getting there is an accomplishment,&quot; he said. &quot;That's something no one can take away from this group and they deserve to be there.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tusie Menne, a 58-year-old Tampa homemaker, walks five miles a day, rides an exercise bike and works out at a health club.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she is not answering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls to &quot;Just do it.&quot; Nor has she heeded Cher's sassy health club plugs.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those commercials are aimed at people much younger than she.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't pay a lot of attention to them,&quot; Menne said. &quot;In fact, I don't watch much TV.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Menne does notice the Total breakfast cereal commercials.  She said she believes the ads that claim Total is nutritionally superior to other brands, partly because those ads feature people who seem to be her contemporaries.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total is her favorite cereal.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature consumers like Menne are becoming an important group to reach.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, most marketing companies have been slow about targeting the 50-plus age group. They pursued nearly everyone else teen-agers, dual-income couples, working women and young urban professionals.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next decade, more baby-boomers will graduate into their 50s and marketers will need to cater to these more experienced consumers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is happening is there will be a great demographic shift,&quot; said Toni J. Pallatto, owner of Gift of Gold, an Ohio-based&nbsp; consumer marketing company.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During the 1990s, the number of people 50 and older will increase 76.7 percent. Correspondingly, people in the 18 to 39 cohort whom marketing people typically target that group shrinks by 10 percent.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have much to learn about how to talk to this more active and experienced generation, said marketing experts specializing in older consumers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot of people over 50 are talking about living into their 90s&quot; said Judith Langer, a consumer marketing consultant in New York.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They are in better health than previous generations; they exercise, watch their nutrition. They are taking more vacations and spending a lot of money. If you still view them as a bunch of old poops, you're going to miss out on an important market.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-50 group already controls 70 percent of the nation's financial assets and 50 percent of its discretionary income representing a total of $ 130-billion in buying power, according to the National Underwriter-Life &amp; Health, a statistical magazine for the insurance industry.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Florida provides a crucial testing ground for companies researching ways to appeal to mature consumers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten of its cities have the oldest populations in the country and the state is home to 6.9 percent of the nation's 64.6-million older adults, according to Sales and Marketing Management, a New York demographics service. In the Tampa Bay area alone, at least six market research companies specialize in polling senior consumers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift of Gold, an Ohio consumer survey firm, this month is shipping free samples and special offers from national consumer companies to 6,000 senior residents in the Tampa Bay area. The residents have agreed to evaluate brands such as Cheerios cereal, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Pan Am airlines, Hamburger Helper and Guest Quarters Suite Hotels.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weitzman &amp; Philip Inc., a Miami market research firm, performs about a quarter of its 400 consumer surveys each year on Florida's senior citizens, said Daniel H. Philip, president. Some of the studies have investigated what kinds of tire treads appeal to senior citizens, what lawn mowers are easiest to use, what liquor they drink, and whether they do their own home maintenance.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The senior citizen complexes here are bombarded with Clairol and Mary Kay samples,&quot; Philip said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the research tools available to them, some consumer goods companies still manage to offend.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern Maturity, the American Association of Retired Persons' monthly magazine, rejects about 40 percent of advertisements proposed to it because the ads portray the 50-plus reader as weak, doddering or ill. Some of the rejected ads sell hemorrhoid treatments, wheelchairs and tub lifts.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We feel they drag the book down and depress our readers,&quot; said Leda Sanford, ad director of the 34-million circulation magazine.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Modern Maturity has rejected ads for most incontinence products because they picture the product and feature clinical diagrams that refer to leakage, bladder control and other personal issues. But recently the magazine accepted a Serenity ad by Johnson &amp; Johnson because it showed a woman enjoying life and it suggested that readers see a doctor about the problem, Sanford said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AARP, a national advocacy group, also opposes advertisements that feature scare tactics, such as some commercials for insurance products and medical alert services, Sanford said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you talk to senior citizens in a way that doesn't insult them?&quot; Philip asked.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Once you get beyond the products that are natural for senior citizens, marketing companies haven't gotten their act together as far as senior citizens' particular habits. They figure they're trying to sell upbeat, cutting-edge products that are hard to market to senior citizens. But they haven't done senior citizen marketing research.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some product managers are just too young to know, Pallatto said. Many brand managers are in their 20s and 30s. Recently she met one who believed senior citizens rarely use deodorant and skin cream and rarely wash their hair.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some beauty companies think along the same lines, said Sanford of Modern Maturity. Few cosmetics and skin care companies advertise in Modern Maturity, even though some of their products supposedly counteract dry skin and wrinkles.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They (beauty companies) have a complex about age,&quot; Sanford said. &quot;They have been worshiping at the altar of youth for so long, they have had a hard time coping with the fact that everybody is getting older.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estee Lauder is one of the few cosmetics and fragrance lines that has a franchise among older women, Sanford and Langer said. The name of its new fragrance, Knowing, subtly signifies that experience and maturity can be sexy and feminine, Langer added.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an Estee Lauder Inc. spokeswoman, Marguerite Barney, said the company doesn't market to specific age groups and hadn't targeted Knowing to older women.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties in reaching older consumers is in pinpointing their diverse lifestyles and values, Pallatto said. Two women may have the same goals when they're 20 to get married, to have a career or to have a family but chances are by the time they are 40 they have taken distinctly different paths, she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is a lot easier marketing to somebody who is 18,&quot; she said.  &quot;Chances are (marketers) have gotten a handle on who they are. We can sell them a pair of jeans. The question is how do you sell jeans to someone 50 and older?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many clothing companies don't know, said William D. Haueisen, president of Sterling Research Group Inc., a St. Petersburg-based retail marketing company.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older women, like most men, usually feel less of a need to bow to the whims of fashion. Consequently many clothiers may face leaner years ahead, he predicted.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical styles that last longer but don't look &quot;old&quot; will be at a premium, he said. Women's business attire will be less in demand, he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menne estimated that it has been at least six months since she added to her wardrobe. &quot;I've got better things in my closet from 20 years ago than what they've got in stores today,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food marketers are better at targeting to older consumers. In the past decade, hundreds of foods have been reformulated with lower salt and cholesterol or with more fiber, partly a reflection of food companies' realization that consumers are getting older but want to feel younger.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell Soup Co.'s V8 juice and Le Menu Healthy dinners are specifically being positioned for the 50-plus consumer. Kellogg Co.  changed its Bran Flakes to 40-Plus Bran Flakes to appeal to older consumers after surveys revealed more than 60 percent of bran eaters are at least 45 years old.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all efforts succeed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerber Products Co. in the mid-1970s test-marketed a line of pureed foods for adults called Singles. The meals were in glass jars&nbsp; that bore the Gerber label.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They failed because of the onset of microwave foods, said James Lovejoy, a Gerber spokesman. Haueisen disagreed, saying that older people perceived Singles as baby food for adults.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of today's seniors reject their rocking-chair image, Langer, the marketing consultant, said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 50-plus consumer panel she set up to test senior citizens' attitudes was particularly annoyed by Denny's restaurant ad campaigns, featuring a forgetful woman who calls the chain &quot;Lenny's.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That ad particularly showed an old lady doddering,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Things are going to change dramatically in the next decade, not because people are becoming more moral or more caring, but because they want to make money,&quot; Sanford of Modern Maturity said.<BR> Times researchers Debbie Wolfe and Kitty Bennett contributed to this report.<BR> Age in America<BR> Here are the 10 oldest and youngest areas in the United States, by median age, according to Sales &amp; Marketing Management.<BR> The 10 Oldest<BR> Sarasota&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52.1 Bradenton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45.7<BR> Fort Myers-Cape Coral&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43.1<BR> Daytona Beach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42.2<BR> W.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pamela Salvo Miller drives up and down Bruce B. Downs Boulevard almost every day.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only after her brother was shot and killed last week did she learn that he had been living in a home made of plastic sheets in the woods just off the street.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> v v &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Homeless&quot; that's what the Sheriff's Office and the media have called her brother, a word that seems hard for her to come to terms with.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said, &quot;My little brother went back to the campsite (Saturday), and a new little family's already moved in. That's how many of them are out there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Vincent Salvo, 34, was shot and killed Thursday evening.  Shortly after midnight, agents with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement stopped two men on suspicion of drunken driving near Ocala. When the agents ran the two men's names through a computer, they learned that both were wanted in Salvo's slaying.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth Arthur, 41, and James Joseph Mahoney, 50, both of Tampa, were charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. They were being held Sunday night at the Hillsborough County Jail without bail.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives say Salvo was killed during a fight at his campsite near the Sunpointe Lake Apartments, 14200 Bruce B. Downs Blvd.  Investigators think the fight stemmed from a quarrel between Arthur and his girlfriend, who had moved in with Salvo on Wednesday night.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheriff's deputies say it is not clear who fired the gun.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives did not release the woman's name, but Miller identified her as Brenda Blackburn, a woman her brother had been dating on and off for about eight years. Blackburn also dated Arthur, Miller said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackburn could not be reached for comment.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said the last time she saw her brother was about a month ago. She said he was on his way to New Port Richey with Blackburn to work at a construction site. He hoped to make enough money to travel to California and join a carnival.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Miller learned instead that her brother's plastic tent, outfitted with dishes, utensils and canned food, had been his home for about eight months.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They're putting him in the category of the homeless, but this thing was set up like an apartment,&quot; she said. &quot;He had two beds that were made he was always real nice and neat and next to them were his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok tennis shoes.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said her brother, an alcoholic, apparently chose this lifestyle. She does not consider him someone who was forced to live in the woods.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My parents would have helped him out anytime,&quot; she said. &quot;You see, he had that option.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salvos moved to Lutz in 1963. Phillip Salvo went to Lutz Elementary School and Buchanan Junior High School. He was in Little League and Boy Scouts and became avidly interested in electronics, his sister said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was the kind of guy who was always offering to rake the neighbors' leaves,&quot; Miller said. &quot;One Christmas, he got a motorcycle. He was always tearing it apart and putting it back together.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said her brother had some &quot;teen-age problems&quot; and was caught several times burglarizing homes. But then he got married and settled down, living in a home in Lutz that had a swimming pool.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, he and his wife had a son, but the infant lived only seven days.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And that's what sent him off the deep end,&quot; Miller said. &quot;He started going out and coming home drunk. Within months, he was divorced.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived with different friends and worked on and off at an Exxon station in north Tampa. For a time, he worked for Miller at a pub she owned in Lutz.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He floated in and out. If he needed something, he'd come by,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his baby died, Miller said, her brother seemed to lose the will to lead the &quot;standard&quot; life.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those material things weren't important to him,&quot; she said. &quot;As long as he ate decent and had whatever little things he needed.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said she and her father found a letter to Brenda Blackburn in her brother's belongings at his campsite. The letter probably was written late last year when Blackburn was visiting her family in Georgia, Miller said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, Salvo mentions Arthur one of the men who is charged with killing him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have been very good to Kenny, while you have been gone,&quot; the letter says. &quot;I have bought him food and drink, cooked for him and gave him money. I tried to keep him out of trouble. . . . I guess most of the reason is so I can keep in touch with you through him, and because I have known Kenny for some years. I know how helpless he can be when he drinks.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Random thoughts:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't it make you feel good all under that Duke has finally won a basketball championship? Especially since it figures that the bet is now paid off and coach Mike Krzyzewski can get a real haircut.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tough as this week must be on former Buccaneers placekicker Donald Igwebuike, what with his heroin trial and all, he can at least take heart in this: Ray Perkins isn't on the jury.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Charles Barkley should have been suspended for a lot longer than one game for spitting on a fan in New Jersey. But you have to understand: Charles never expelled anything from his mouth before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the Pirates are trying to get rid of Bobby Bonilla, is it too early for the Tampa Bay baseball franchise to get involved?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anyone else fighting post-Plan B depression?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be deciding if you can tolerate the WLAF, but you have to love this wonderful new toy called the HelmetCam. And you have to figure that, any day, it's going to catch someone like Orlando's Kerwin Bell scoping the cheerleaders.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a lot easier to feel sorry for Sugar Ray Leonard and his plight with drugs if not for this: The news of his drug use almost obscured his admission that he had physically abused his ex-wife, Juanita. That's where the sympathy stops.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case you're wondering, &quot;Krzyzew-ski&quot; would score 126 points on a triple-word score in Scrabble.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;With major-league baseball teams cutting high-priced players on the hour, how long do you think it will be before someone actually asks to have his contract reduced? Uh, would someone tell Rafael Ramirez where the line starts.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sure Rocket Ismail is going to Canada as soon as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> introduces a line of snowshoes. Face it, the guy has turned his future over to the cash register, and that spells NFL.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jerry Tarkanian really does leave UNLV, what's the bet he ends up as the bad guy in the next James Bond movie? (They lose in the end too).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in case the National League Expansion Committee comes back, shouldn't we make cardboard cutouts of a few skyscrapers and scatter them around St. Petersburg?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world would pay a lot closer attention to the women's tennis tour if a few more of the top 10 players had their drivers' licenses.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not Bobby Bonilla, could the Tampa Bay baseball team at least sign Bo Jackson? Maybe his rehab would be over in time to help the team in its first run for the pennant. Maybe not.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Roger Craig has left the San Francisco 49ers for the L.A.  Raiders, you have to wonder: Are the already pass-happy 49ers ever going to run the ball again?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were Evander Holyfield, I'd rather fight George Foreman twice than mess with ex-wife Paulette. Paulette who sort of comes across as a Robin Givens wannabe had previously agreed to a divorce worth between $ 3-million and $ 4-million, but now she wants to renegotiate. What? Weren't the incentive clauses strong enough?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it. If you had won the $ 15-million Lotto last week, you would still have $ 450,000 less than Dwight Gooden's new contract.  And Gooden's pays out over three years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the WLAF (and isn't everyone?), what is the penalty for licking that day-glo Orlando Thunder uniform?<BR> If Al Davis, that old 49er-collector, calls for Dwight Clark's phone number, give it to him.<BR> For all of Dean Smith's fame, has anyone else noticed that he has won as many NCAA championships as Steve Fisher? And was anyone else looking for him in the final minute of the Duke-Kansas game, just to see if he was going to surrender to the Jayhawks again?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With seven of the Bucs' unprotected players signing with new teams (and actually getting money for it) you have to wonder: Has the rest of the league been paying attention?<BR> They sure did get a lot of people to watch exhibition baseball in Miami last weekend. But how many times can they stage &quot;Free Handgun Day&quot; if they really get a team?<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Reinsdorf knows business. After studying the upside, the downside and having someone translate the medical side, the chairman of the Chicago White Sox made what he termed a sound business decision: His team would go for Bo.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White Sox struck a deal with Bo Jackson, the two-sport superstar who was released last month by Kansas City because of a hip injury the team felt would prevent him from playing baseball again.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson agreed to terms with the White Sox on a one-year contract with two additional years at the club's option that guarantees him at least $ 700,000 for this season and could be worth $ 8.15-million for the three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think the risk is very large,&quot; Reinsdorf said Wednesday, &quot;and the reward is incredible.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not contractually required to play this season but said he hoped to return to the field sometime after the July 9 All-Star Game.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Realistically, we don't expect him until 1992,&quot; said White Sox vice president Ron Schueler.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract is keyed to Jackson's recovery from the injury, which could make his hip the most-watched since Madonna's.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal includes a guaranteed base salary of $ 700,000 and an additional $ 10,000 for each game he is available to play this season up to 80. He could earn $ 1.5-million, plus the $ 391,484 Kansas City owes him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1992 option, Jackson would make his 1991 earnings less $ 100,000, plus bonuses of $ 10,000 for each game available up to 150, for a maximum of $ 2.9-million. Under the 1993 option, he would make his 1992 earnings plus bonuses of $ 10,000 for each game available, with a maximum salary of $ 3.75-million.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1992 salary would become guaranteed if Jackson is available for 40 games this season, including 30 after Aug. 31. The 1993 salary would become guaranteed if Jackson plays 125 games in 1992.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not limited from continuing his football career under the contract and said he would not change his plans to continue his two-sport career. The running back is entering the final season of a five-year deal with the Los Angeles Raiders.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raiders executive assistant Al LoCasale told the Associated Press the team expects Jackson to play football again and to report at the &quot;middle of the season, just as we have the past four seasons.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Sox have some sort of protection in the contract regarding football, agent Richard Woods said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and Woods said they had been contacted by more than half the 26 major-league teams, but declined to name other suitors.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was made over the weekend to sign with the White Sox because of the team's talent, youth and potential. &quot;Of all the teams in the league, the White Sox have the best chance of going out and getting the ring,&quot; Jackson said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors were the quality of the team's medical and rehabilitative staff, the grass field, the large market, and the chance to stay in the American League, Woods said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This was not an auction to the highest bidder,&quot; Woods said. &quot;We could have gotten a helluva lot more money if we shopped it around like a free-agent situation.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is making good progress in recovery from the injury, according to Dr. James Andrews, the Birmingham, Ala., physician supervising Jackson's recovery. Jackson will check in with Andrews in a month and a decision on playing again this season will be made at the All-Star break, Andrews said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinsdorf said that timetable is fine with him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I approached this with the idea that he won't play this season and felt it was a sound business decision,&quot; Reinsdorf said. &quot;If he is able to play this year, then that's a bonus.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I also evaluated it on the basis that he might never play and concluded that it was a sound business risk worth trying.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson injured his hip Jan. 13 in the Raiders' playoff victory over Cincinnati and has been on crutches since then. The Royals released him March 18 when their team physician said Jackson should not play baseball this season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrews said Jackson has a bruise to the bone in his left hip and damage to the cartilage around the hip socket. But he said it is not a typical avascular necrosis, a disease in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, and thus &quot;not a typical prognosis.&quot; He said there is &quot;excellent potential&quot; for Jackson to heal.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson said Wednesday he could walk without crutches and without pain and felt like a &quot;caged animal&quot; waiting for Andrews to give him the okay to begin running.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Sox made the decision to sign Jackson after their orthopedic surgeon, Dr. James Boscardin, examined Jackson's medical records, and after all 26 teams passed on claiming Jackson.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson wore a White Sox cap and held a No. 8 jersey at the news conference and made it clear he liked the idea of going to Chicago.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll share the spotlight there with Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan. Jackson and Jordan are two of sports' biggest celebrities and are the stars of major advertising campaigns for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods said there will be an announcement next week about an unrelated ad campaign involving Jordan and Jackson, and said he would contact </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about the possibility of a joint program.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Sox players greeted the news of Jackson's signing with mixed reaction.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First baseman Frank Thomas, who played with Jackson at Auburn, said White Sox management asked him last week if Jackson was worth signing. &quot;I said of course,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;He's the type of person who will elevate everyone.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitcher Jack McDowell, one of several young White Sox players who has complained about his salary, was less complimentary.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to hold my tongue on it now about where this magic money is coming from. There's nothing you can do about it,&quot; McDowell said. &quot;Maybe he can get me a pair of cleats. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't give me any more because I paint the stripe black.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa businessman Woody Bell enjoys spending money on his men's all-star team, especially when the returns make Bell Corporation a world slow-pitch power.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Bell began his big-dollar spending spree four years ago. The desire to own and operate a powerhouse club that would destroy opposition became an obsession. That's when Bell started scouring the nation and acquiring the superstars of the sport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tampa-based Bell Corporation is among the top five Super Open Division teams competing under any association Amateur Softball Association, United States Slow-pitch Softball Association or Independent Softball Association.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Bell Corporation is rated in the same class as Steele's Sports, which set a world record in 1990 by winning 142 consecutive games. In fact, Woody's Bell Bombers defeated Steele's three times last summer, including the victory halting Steele's amazing win streak.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell Corporation has just one local player on its roster, star first baseman Mark Hierlmeier of Tampa. But the team still will be worth watching Saturday night in a three-game exhibition against local all-star teams at the Greco Complex.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Bell takes on the Pinellas County All-Stars at 5, the Hillsborough County All-Stars at 7, then a combination of the two teams at 9.  Admission is free.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> &quot;We hope people in the Bay area who enjoy softball, seeing long home runs and watching some of the world's best players come out and see the team Saturday,&quot; Bell said. &quot;This is our first get-together of the year, and it should be a lot of fun for everyone.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Bell Corporation posted a 71-22 record last season, placing third in the USSSA and ISA Super Open World Tournaments. The team's 13 players averaged 14 home runs and 36 runs per game. Among the top players is former major-league veteran infielder Doug Flynn (shortstop).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players live around the country, traveling by airplane to tournaments. Bell estimates this year's budget will run between $ 175,000 and $ 200,000, but he's receiving major financial support from several national sponsors.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Louisville Slugger is supplying money, bats, batting gloves and bat bags. Wilson Sporting Goods is giving money, gloves, uniforms, traveling shirts, warm-ups and balls. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is providing cleats and other footwear.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> &quot;These people are so important to our success and financial backing,&quot; Bell said. &quot;Without them, we could not get the job done like we do.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR> Tournament result: Denning's Lounge (32-11) posted a 5-1 record en route to the USSSA men's Class B national-qualifying tournament championship Sunday at the Eddie C. Moore Complex in Clearwater. Denning's, 6-2 and tied for first place in the Tampa City League's Pacific Division, bounced back from an opening-round loss to win five straight and claim the title, plus a national berth Labor Day weekend in Fort Walton Beach.  Sarasota's Babe's Plumbing was second, Tampa's Buddy Bi-Rite placed third and Brandon's Bernico's finished fourth.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Denning's, shortstop Chris Gabbard had the most home runs (four), leftfielder Vince Miniet collected the most hits (12-for-20) and pitcher Wilson Feick (12-for-19, 5-1 record) was the most valuable player. Second baseman Mo Collins (10-for-17) and left-centerfielder Billy Turner (12-for-21) also contributed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players needed: The Tampa Sharks slow-pitch team is seeking players ages 49 through 59 to play in a 35-team state league. The schedule features monthly tournaments. In addition, 50-and-over and 60-and-over teams play double-headers Saturday mornings.  For information, contact Jack Jesmer at 837-2923 or Lou McKenna at 887-1049.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Three-Score Club needs players 60 or older for its league, which plays at 8 a.m. Mondays and Wednesdays at the Eddie C.  Moore Complex. For more informaton, call 1-531-7600 or 1-531-7474.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Upcoming tournaments: A USSSA men's Class C and D national qualifier is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at the Greco Complex. Cost is $ 130. For information, contact Norman Erickson at 985-5366.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The entry deadline of the 16th annual Spring Gold Cup Men's Classic is Friday. The ASA tournament is at J.C. Hanley Park in south Brandon. Cost is $ 90. For more information, call 654-2255.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> An ISA men's and women's Class A and AA national qualifier is scheduled for April 20-21 at the Greco Complex. The entry deadline is April 16. Cost is $ 135 plus a sanction fee. For more information, contact Bill Muscatello at 644-2468 (days) or Jeff Singleton at 821-4602 (evenings).<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alamo International diving meet came down to the final dive Sunday as Germany's Jan Hempel came from behind to beat China's Sun Shuwei in the men's platform event. The event at the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale was Hempel's first international win since the unification of Germany last year. &quot;Both times I've competed in the U.S. I've won,&quot; smiled Hempel, referring to his victory at last year's Goodwill Games in Seattle. &quot;I like it here.&quot; Hempel wasn't smiling when Sun, the 15-year-old World platform champion at last week's VII FINA World Cup meet, built up an 11.81 point lead, heading into his 10th and final dive. But he overshot his mark on the reverse 3 somersault, scoring just a 63.24, and falling short, 637.44 to Hempel's 644.49. Dmitri Sautin of the Soviet Union won the bronze at 635.37. In the women's 3-meter springboard finals, Soviet diver Irina Lashko led from start to finish. Wendy Lucero of Denver was second and Brita Baldus of Germany was third.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Track: Lynn Jennings broke away from Susan Sirma in the closing stages and raced to an 8-kilometer world record Sunday in winning the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's Race in Washington, D.C. Jennings, the two-time world cross-country champion, was timed in 25 minutes, 2 seconds, breaking the mark of 25:03 held by Grete Waitz of Norway.  Mary Slaney showed the rustiness of not having competed for nearly a year. Slaney, who rarely loses to an American and rarely loses on her home track, Hayward Field, was beaten Saturday night by Shelly Steely in the 1,500-meter race at the Oregon Twilight meet. &quot;It came down to a sprint and I don't have that extra gear yet,&quot; Slaney said. Steely won in 4:07.92. Slaney was second in 4:08.51. Tony Dees, who lives and trains in Tampa with the Florida Clippers, won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.25 seconds Saturday night at the S&amp;W Modesto (Calif.) Invitational track meet.<BR><BR> Football: Tampa police said Sunday they have not filed charges in a traffic accident early Saturday involving Tampa Bay Buccaneers fullback Jamie Lawson and two Clearwater women. Police said charges are pending the results of a blood-alcohol test on Lawson that should be available by the middle of this week. Tony Baker's 6-yard touchdown rallied the Frankfurt Galaxy to a 10-3 victory over the Birmingham Fire in a WLAF game in Frankfurt, Germany.<BR><BR> Etcetera: Rain halted first-round action at the 52nd annual Southeastern Conference Men's Golf Championships in West Point, Miss. Play will resume today with the conclusion of the first round to be immediately followed by the second round. Germany's Rolf Aldag outsprinted a group of 19 riders to win the third stage of the Tour Du Pont cycling race in Arlington, Va., and American Greg Oravetz finished second to move into the overall lead.<BR> Compiled by Kim Pendery.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Martin won the pole Wednesday for the Coca-Cola 600 by being the fastest of four drivers to break the year-old event record at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Martin had a top lap of 174.820 mph in his Ford Thunderbird to win his 13th career pole.  Ken Schrader, Michael Waltrip and Sterling Marlin also broke the event qualifying mark as the top 20 starting positions were filled.  The remainder of the 40-car field for Sunday's event will be determined in time trials today. In an unprecedented move, the sanctioning body for stock car racing's top circuit reduced the 12-week suspension of car owner Junior Johnson for using an oversized engine. NASCAR commissioner Semon E. Knudsen, the final route of appeal, trimmed the suspension to four races less than three hours after officials announced that an appeals panel had refused to ease the suspension. Johnson's team prepared to continue racing without the owner and crew chief beginning with Sunday's Coca-Cola 600. Johnson's wife, Flossie, came to the track to obtain a NASCAR owner's license, and the car's No. 11 markings were changed to 97s to reflect new ownership.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Endorsements: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. has appointed Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson to its board of directors.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promoter Dan Duva said heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield will sue the World Boxing Council after the WBC ordered a 60-40 purse split for his mandatory title defense against ex-champ Mike Tyson. The International Boxing Federation previously had rejected a request by Tyson to alter the standard 75-25 champion-challenger purse split, and the World Boxing Association is expected to adhere to the 75-25 division. &quot;This latest WBC action is a transparent attempt by Don King and Jose Sulaiman to force Evander Holyfield to either agree to allow the WBC to take $ 8-to $ 10-million from Holyfield's anticipated purse for the Tyson bout and give that money to Mike Tyson, or be stripped of the WBC heavyweight title,&quot; Duva said. &quot;Obviously, neither alternative is acceptable.&quot; Terry Norris, probably best known as the man who finally sent Sugar Ray Leonard into permanent retirement, defends his WBC super welterweight title tonight against former champion Donald Curry. Their bout is half a title doubleheader that also features World Boxing Association welterweight champion Meldrick Taylor against unbeaten Luis Garcia of Venezuela.<BR> David Gonzales, ranked fourth in the North American Boxing Federation's junior-middleweight class, ran his record to 26-1-1 (19 KOs) with a seventh round TKO over Anthony Williams (13-6-2) in the main event of Friday's professional boxing card at the St.  Petersburg Hilton. On the undercard, junior middleweight John Coward (9-0, 8 KOs) scored a TKO over Johnny McClendon with six seconds left in the seventh round.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Autos: Michael Waltrip won his first career Winston Cup pole Friday, edging Rusty Wallace for the top starting spot in Sunday's NASCAR Budweiser 500 stock car race in Dover, Del. &quot;I was 0-for-180-some I think,&quot; Waltrip said after steering his Pontiac to a 143.392 mph lap. The U.S. Auto Club has no plans to take action against Mario Andretti for stopping his car during the Indianapolis 500 despite a taped message from Andretti's pit crew that urged him to create a caution period, a spokesman said today. Nigel Mansell won the provisional pole position for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.<BR> College basketball: Convicted sports fixer Richard Perry had seats directly behind the UNLV bench in the Rebels' basketball game with Florida State last December, a newspaper reported Friday.  The Las Vegas Review-Journal published a photo of Perry sitting in a seat behind the UNLV bench at the Florida State game Dec. 22.  The seat was one of 25 given to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe representative Sonny Vaccaro, who promoted the game. Vaccaro said Thursday he gave the seats to either UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian or the coach's friend, casino host Mike Toney. Tarkanian said he didn't know Perry was at the game, and that it would not be fair to link him to Perry's presence at the game because the seats were in Vaccaro's name. Meanwhile, the newspaper reported the University of Nevada Board of Regents would meet in an executive personnel session Monday to discuss the UNLV basketball program. Eight teams were named to play in the Greak Alaska Shootout next fall: Alaska Anchorage, Coastal Carolina, Eastern Michigan, New Orleans, Massachusetts, Idaho, Oregon State and Santa Clara. The tournament will be Nov. 29-Dec. 2.<BR> College football: Although he has a year of eligibility left, BYU's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Ty Detmer had made his first appearance on a professional football card much to his and his school's consternation. The Pro Set card company, based in Dallas, annually issues a card featuring the previous year's Heisman Trophy winner as part of its NFL set. This year's card No. 37 depicts Detmer. The problem: Most Heisman Trophy winners go right into the pro ranks. Detmer won the trophy as a junior. Having Detmer appear in the commercial set, making money for a profitmaking venture, could be construed as a violation of NCAA rules, BYU officials say. The NCAA notified Clemson on Friday it was lifting the school's probation imposed exactly a year ago for rule violations within the football program. The College Football Association opened its annual meeting Friday in Dallas with a panel of presidents telling coaches and athletic directors that they face tightening budgets and stricter academic requirements in the 1990s.<BR> Etcetera: University of Florida tennis players Jillian Alexander, Nicole Arendt, Andrea Farley and Holly Lloyd were chosen All-Southeastern Conference team members for the 1991 season.  Lite Light, whose 10-length victory in the Kentucky Oaks stamped her as a possible Belmont Stakes starter, will stay away from the colts, running instead in the Mother Goose Stakes. The decision to<BR> run Lite Light in the filly race reduced the probable starting lineup for the June 8 Belmont to 11 horses, including Derby winner Strike the Gold and Preakness champ Hansel. Steve Hoskins of Tarpon Springs and Philip Ringener moved back into the lead after five rounds Friday in the PBA's Beaumont Doubles Classic in Texas.<BR> Compiled by Kim Pendery.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hopes of one British family to become permanent residents of the United States may well rest on an 8-foot by 4-foot collection of plywood, nets and ramps designed to teach children how to kick and head a soccer ball.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its creator, Alan Ball, is hoping to turn the invention dubbed Ball-E-Wall into the hottest sports item since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more than money at stake here.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ball is hoping the Ball-E-Wall will be enough of a commercial success to warrant a small manufacturing plant in St. Petersburg.  Even better would be for a major sporting goods company to buy the rights to the product and pay Ball a lot of money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I could buy a business,&quot; says Ball. &quot;I could buy a McDonald's and employ 30 people.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, Ball needs to start a business that will employ enough American citizens to satisfy immigration authorities that his business is necessary to the area's economy. Then, authorities will let him and his family stay in St. Petersburg, rather than forcing them to return to England.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the Balls face the very real prospect of having to leave the States in the not-too-distant future. Their visas have expired and they are appealing the Department of Immigration's denial of an application for a permanent visa.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Balls own two trailer parks in St. Petersburg, they manage the concerns themselves and employ only three part-time workers. That's not enough, according to the government.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;After searching unsuccessfully for a business they could afford that employed enough people, Ball decided to try to make a go of a product he started developing eight years ago &quot;when I realized Americans can't kick a ball. They can throw anything, but they can't kick,&quot; he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that there weren't enough walls to use for kicking against, so he devised a portable one. He added two angled wings on either side and a net across the top to keep the ball from going over the wall. Finally, Ball devised ramps to attach to the top and bottom of the back wall that lift the ball up in the air. Without the ramps, a player can practice kicking, chasing and dribbling the ball. With the ramp, players can practice heading the ball.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ball-E-Wall will be unveiled officially this weekend at the Sports and Recreation exhibit at the Florida Suncoast Dome. Ball said he is anxious.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I stayed up until 3 o'clock in the morning last night doing the voice over for the video,&quot; Ball said Monday. &quot;Barbara kept saying, &quot;Nobody will understand it, you have to sound more American.' &quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight years in the United States have not erased the British accent from Ball's speech. He has the most difficulty pronouncing the name of his own product. When he says it, it sounds more like &quot;Bowl-E-Woll.&quot; He tries broadening his vowels, but can't get it quite right.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered having one of his children narrate the video. Dean, 21, the eldest, retains a trace of London in his voice. Adam, who was 9 when he came to live in the States, has no trace of a British accent.  And 10-year-old Karly is, as Ball puts it, a &quot;typical American Tom-boy.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the family wants to return to England, although Barbara and Alan would like to visit their elderly parents. But because their visas are expired, they would not be able to re-enter the Unites States if they left.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent residency has been the Balls' intention since they moved here in 1983. On the advice of an individual touting himself as an &quot;immigration consultant,&quot; Ball invested $ 300,000 in two trailer parks in St. Petersburg. He thought the investment would not only generate income but satisfy government requirements for permanent residency.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received an L-1 or &quot;inter-company transfer&quot; visa and was &quot; assured that after five years they could apply for permanent visas.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Balls faithfully renewed the visa every year or two. In 1986, Ball gave the immigration consultant $ 900 to file for citizenship for the family.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the last I ever saw of him,&quot; said Ball.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They learned through another immigration consultant that an L-1 visa cannot be converted into the necessary E-2 or &quot;treaty investors visa.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L-1 visa ran out in May 1989. Immigration has twice denied the Balls' request for permanent visas. They don't expect to hear a decision on the second appeal until the end of the year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, they have spent more than $ 10,000 in the process, not to mention the money invested in the trailer parks and their home or the money being used to create and market Ball-E-Wall.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

Then, two weeks ago, he plowed through the Wimbledon qualifying rounds, beating up-and-comer Bryan Shelton along the way, to earn his first spot in the Wimbledon main draw. There he lost to Britain's Nick Brown in the first round 6-4, 7-5, 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't bother Mark Keil right now. He's in a world all his own.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dangling from the lower rungs of the pro tennis world, the former University of South Florida player is still floating from his upset last month of U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's been everything you dream of,&quot; Keil said from his Tampa home. &quot;If someone had told me when I was at USF that I would beat the U.S. Open champ and make the Wimbledon main draw, I would have laughed in their face. But, you know, if you work hard, dreams come true.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keil's dreams didn't come easy. He broke his foot one week after leaving USF a year and half early in 1989 to turn pro. That same year, he broke the same foot twice more. As a result, Keil's ranking plummeted from the mid-200s to No. 885.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I almost packed it in,&quot; said Keil, who has a private sponsor who supports his tennis career. &quot;I went back to school for a semester and everyone was saying &quot;Hey, I thought you turned pro?' I went back (to the tour) because I had to prove to myself that I could do it.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Keil's ranking is still only 174, it may not seem like he's proved much. But, to him, the real accomplishment is in feeling like he belongs. After the Sampras victory, he said top-ranked Stefan Edberg congratulated him on his win. And at Wimbledon, veteran Jimmy Connors practiced with him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before, people didn't know me from a bar of soap,&quot; said Keil, who is coached by Alan Webb of Germany and sometimes by USF men's coach Eric Hayes. &quot;It's just nice to finally get the respect of your peers, to finally have your colleagues know you're alive.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's about time, huh?&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossman just doing it: Seems Andre Agassi isn't the only one who may wake up the country club with loud, blinding clothing. Ann Grossman, who trains at Saddlebrook Resort, recently signed a new deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to wear brightly colored outfits similar to what Agassi wears.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye-catching outfits, though, are nothing new to Grossman. The body-fitting Lycra tennis outfit she donned at last year's U.S. Open was banned by tournament officials.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navratilova owns Windy City: With nine singles titles, Martina Navratilova will no doubt be remembered for her record-setting Wimbledon success. But Chicago, not England, is the place where she has earned the most titles. Navratilova has won the Virginia Slims of Chicago 11 times.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuttler bound for England: University of Florida tennis player Erika Kuttler of St. Petersburg is on the seven-member United States team that will compete in the World University Games this month in Sheffield, England.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuttler, who played No.  singles for the Southeastern Conference champion Gators, is joined on the team by Georgia's Angela Lettiere of Vero Beach and Gator Mark Merklein of Coral Springs.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Games are sponsored by the International Olympic Committee and are expected to attract about 6,000 athletes from 130 countries.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open for business: Shri Anandan has opened a new tennis center in St. Petersburg. The club, called the Suncoast Village Tennis Center, is located at the Econo Lodge at 3000 34th Street S. It is expected to have 10 hard courts. The club is accepting kids from ages 8 to 18, and adults of all abilities. For more information, call the center at 539-6868.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Palmer accolade: Jared Palmer of Saddlebrook, who won the NCAA singles championships last month, was named to the 1991 Volvo Tennis All-American team. Palmer was tabbed as an All-American in both singles and doubles by the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association, which selects the team.<BR></SPAN></P>

After losing the first game 15-8, the TBJVC 18s rallied to take a 13-12 second-game lead on an ace by Deanna Bosschaert but was unable to finish out the game, losing 17-15.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This seems to happen all the time,&quot; player Kathy Beecroft said of the loss. &quot;We don't start playing our best till the end. I think it just takes us a while to get started.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beecroft, who competed in last year's national meet in Albuquerque, N.M., said she's not sure how she likes having the homecourt advantage this year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's nice because you sleep in your own bed, but then it doesn't seem like the J.O.'s (Junior Olympics) because you aren't packing and airplaning,&quot; she said. &quot;It just doesn't seem the same, that's all.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pool play continues today and Thursday, and the tournament runs through Saturday.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Edwards got a dose of reality when her team, Sports Performance from Chicago, defeated San Luis Obispo 9-15, 15-13, 15-11 Saturday afternoon at the University of Tampa in the girls 18s final of the National Junior Olympic Volleyball Championships.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not often that your dreams come true, but this time they did,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;The last time we won it I was in eighth grade, and I remember watching that match, hoping I could play in a match like it someday. So it was great a dream come true.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides winning the national championship, Edwards was named as a first team All-American and won Player of the Year honors.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The win marked the fourth time in four meetings this year that Sports Performance, seeded first, has beaten SLO, seeded second. It was the third match to go three games.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We knew this year that it was going to be a dogfight between us and them,&quot; Sports Performance coach Rick Butler said. &quot;It was a great tournament. Of course, when you win, it's always a great tournament.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another team from the same club, Sports Performance Red, took third place in the girls 18s.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other action, Borinquen Gardens of Puerto Rico defeated California's Santa Monica Bay Club 15-10, 15-7 in the boys 16s final.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two California teams dueled for the girls 16s championship with top-seeded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike/</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ichiban beating Asics Tiger Volleyball Club 15-8, 15-7.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunkist/Rip it Up from California defeated Outrigger Canoe Club from Hawaii 15-6, 17-15 in the boys 18s final, but because it was Rip it Up's first loss in the double elimination Gold Championships bracket, there was a one-game playoff. Outrigger came out on top 15-9 to clinch the title.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three teams from the Tampa Bay Juniors Volleyball Club also competed in the five-day tournament but were finished on Friday.  TBJVC 16s, seeded fourth, fared the best tied for fifth out of 70 teams.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like an aging warrior, a battered camper rumbles into the parking lot of Media Ventures studios on a recent afternoon, coming to rest next to a Mercedes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian Paskowitz, 70, the slender, white-haired patriarch of America's foremost surfing family, jumps out toting a video camera in one hand and a bag of bagels in the other.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, there's my son Israel,&quot; he says excitedly, gesturing toward a crowd of young men and women huddled together near the recording studio entrance. &quot;Will he come down here looking like a human being? No? He grows a Fu Manchu beard and winds up looking like Rita Hayworth after a bad night.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz, a Stanford University doctor who abruptly junked a lucrative private practice to roam the world in a camper with his wife and nine children, has brought his brood to town to record a song written by his eldest son, David, 32. The song, It's Real, is inspired by the family's unusual past most of which was spent living a mobile existence in a tiny camper in search of the next wave.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious blend of Swiss Family Robinson and the Partridge Family, the Paskowitzes traveled their own world. From the clear, lukewarm waters of the Mediterranean to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, their motto remained the same: to take only what they needed to survive, eat simply, live clean and surf whenever possible.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the family's only home was a blue camper 96 inches wide, 78 inches high and 20 feet long. They figured that there was just enough room to allow each child 3 cubic feet in which to grow up.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsiders were quick to dismiss the clan as a sorry freak show, a ragtag bunch of unschooled youths whose parents were crazy to raise them without basic necessities such as a house, formal education, Boy Scouts and Little League.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that they are all grown up, the Paskowitz children, ages 16 to 32, are the envy of many conventional parents. No one is strung out on drugs or serving time behind bars. Everyone can read and write. Unlike their parents who shunned society entirely, each of the Paskowitz offspring has struck out on his or her own career.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz children's names read like a Who's Who of biblical history:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, who lives in San Clemente, is the lead singer for a surfing rock band. Jonathan, 30, is a world-class long board surfer and partner in a skateboarding company in San Clemente.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham, 29, lives in a two-story Victorian in San Francisco and markets surf wear. Israel, 28, lives in San Clemente and is a world-class long board surfer who modeled surf wear for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses, 26, runs a surfboard marketing company in San Clemente.  Adam, 25, a singer who lives in the Los Angeles area, recently signed a recording contract with a SBK Records. Salvador, 23, a San Clemente-based graphic artist, has designed a surfing comic strip called &quot;Riders of Steel&quot; that will soon be made into a television cartoon show.  : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only daughter, Navah, 21, a model, shares an apartment in San Clemente with Salvador and Joshua, 16, the youngest, who works for Jonathan.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conspicuously absent from the recording session is Adam, who has changed his last name and cut all ties with his unconventional family.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're pretty lucky to come out the way we did,&quot; Jonathan says.  &quot;But when you boil it down, we are the most normal people I have ever met.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior Paskowitz, who still spends most of the year living in a camper in Cabo San Lucas with his wife Juliette, maintains that their family secret was really quite simple.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;(If) you want kids, then you're supposed to take care of them,&quot; Paskowitz said. &quot;I told my wife shortly after our honeymoon that what I wanted her to do was at least the same that animals do for their babies. Animals in the wild take care of their kids, and the first thing they do is hold them near.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz, who graduated from Stanford Medical School in 1946, says he quit his medical practice before his eldest son was born because he decided that it was impossible to work 40 to 50 hours a week and raise a family.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he and Juliette, a classically trained opera singer from Mexico, opted to devote all of their energies to their children. &quot;We were willing to give up some of the things that in a whole lifetime people will find out are less than fulfilling,&quot; Paskowitz said.  &quot;Juliette and I used to wake up our kids at night just to play with them.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz would offer his services at low-income hospitals across the United States and in Mexico. He supplemented his income by writing a series of health-related articles for Surfer magazine, stressing the importance of clean, healthy living.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where their travels took them, every summer the family would return to their private Shangri-La the Paskowitz Surfing Camp in San Onofre, Calif. Here, they rubbed elbows with the sons and daughters of oil executives, newspaper publishers and other advantaged youths.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paskowitzes hope that cutting a record will be a first step toward bringing their unconventional version of the American&nbsp; dream to the silver screen.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In true Hollywood fashion, they have hired an agent to peddle their product.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it is very likely that it will become part of the sound track to a television movie,&quot; said Matt Weaver, who paid the $ 400 fee for the four-hour studio session.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a strange way, the Paskowitzes and Hollywood seem a perfect match.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All our lives people have said, &quot;You're the famous Paskowitz family,' but we were never famous. We were poor surfer boys,&quot; says Abraham. &quot;But one of the things that will make us famous is our love. That bond that gave us a chance to do everything we ever wanted.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boom for distance runners didn't really begin in 1972, when Frank Shorter won the Olympic marathon in Munich.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really began when Shorter was 11 years old, in a private school with a strict dress code in upstate New York.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When I was younger, I wanted to be a downhill ski racer,&quot; said Shorter, who stopped in Tampa Bay Thursday on his way to the Sunshine State Games in Bradenton. &quot;I read about all my ski heroes in the '60s. They were the first skiers to do off-season training and they ran. I said, &quot;Well, I'll start running.' And the way I started was by running to and from school about 2 miles away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somehow I talked the teachers into allowing me to wear sneakers in school because I ran in them. Not only that, in gym class I convinced the gym teacher to let me run around the field during gym class rather than play touch football. Somehow I convinced them that I was training to become this ski racer.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I found that I was a better runner than a skier.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shorter was the best in those '72 Games. He won an event that was the domain for Africans and Europeans, the first U.S. marathon winner since 1908. He was an All-America kid who won something besides the mile. And it changed the nation's outlook on distance running.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was the first time anyone could remember an American that won a marathon,&quot; said Jimmy Carnes, Shorter's track coach at Florida and a former president of The Athletics Congress. &quot;At the time I was coaching, I thought it was the beginning of a dynasty.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a dynasty for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok and Adidas and every other company that manufactured running shoes. They called it jogging. Now, thanks to Shorter, everyone runs. President Bush.  Madonna. They run far and for a long time. On lunch breaks.  Between business meetings. It spelled relief for stress. And the fitness craze began for a country known for its high food consumption.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mile used to be the American event. But now, longer is better.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What it did was it started people thinking well, if this person can do that, maybe I should give this a try,&quot; Shorter said. &quot;Maybe this distance isn't so mystical and unattainable.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot of Americans started running and found out they liked to do it for the same reasons I did. It's a very personal kind of goal-setting.  Distance running appeals to the American idea of seeing a goal, realizing it's attainable, and saying &quot;I really can run the Boston Marathon.' '<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though people from all walks of life run for exercise, no American has won the Olympic marathon or the 10,000 meters since Shorter broke the tape in 1972.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's not the important factor to Shorter, who rested in Tampa during the torch tour for the Sunshine State Games. The eight-day, 480-mile run that began in Miami ended Friday night in Bradenton, site of the 1991 Games.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between training for his biathlons and running his sportswear business, Shorter is one of the torch carriers for the Games. To him, the Games are a way for athletes to try different sports, like he did.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the reasons I think it's important to support these Games is you've got 40 sports and you've got all sorts of kids, and with all that diversity, you're going to be able to expose these kids to all different sports,&quot; Shorter said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're not talking sending kids to the Olympics. It's good for everybody to have something else they can do. For many children that can be sports.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorter just wants the kids to discover the joy in sports as he did.  And he still enjoys the running, at age 43, and the competition.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like beating guys who say &quot;Yeah, you're my dad's favorite runner,' &quot; Shorter said. &quot;It's sort of fun.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first running shoe was worn by cross-country runners in ancient Greece. There was not, contrary to popular belief, a marathon at the ancient Olympics. There was something called the stade-race or dromos, roughly 192 yards, and the dolichos, which was 24 dromos, enough to make a marching band.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoes were not shoes at all, but were boots made of solid bronze, three inches thick, which is why all races were mistaken for marathons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sporting fashion had been around for a while; it was introduced shortly after the great warrior Achilles was killed by an arrow to the heel. The boot forced the invention of a special running technique that involved striding with the arm and leg simultaneously. Examples of this technique can be seen in ancient Greek art.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, there were a number of noted runners, like Arthroscopos of Crete, who reportedly had no joints below his waist, and Meniscus of Sparta, who supposedly had legs so strong that he stood in for Atlas during bathroom breaks.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sign of discontent came during the Greek-Persian war in 490 b.c. A messenger called Pheidippides ran 22 miles from Marathon to Athens to bring news of the Greek victory. Falling exhausted at his destination, and in a hallucinatory rapture, he spat out one word, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ', which roughly translates into either &quot;We won ',&quot; &quot;I need some cross-training shoes&quot; or &quot;I'm an actor, not an athlete&quot;.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he died.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another runner, Deerfoot, inspired another shoe design in the mid-19th century. Deerfoot, otherwise known as Louis Bennett, was the first great American distance athlete. He competed in England in the 1860s, had a seven-foot stride, set a record for the greatest distance covered in an hour (11 miles, 970 yards), and introduced uneven pacing to running. Before his era, entrants would run as a pack for most of the race, kick like mad the final mile, then collapse and occasionally die.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of gaining credit as the first competitor who was smart enough to keep from killing himself, Deerfoot, a Native American who ran in a loincloth and an eagle's-feather headdress, became cross-country running's first &quot;natural&quot; athlete.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deerfoot wore moccasins instead of the traditional pedestrian's spikes, causing some observers to attribute his success to his footwear.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It bloomin' gotta be the shoes,&quot; said British expatriate shoemaker, Mark Blacksmith, who then constructed the first&nbsp; all-natural athletic shoes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model was introduced in America in 1863: leather moccasins treated in a special solution made of fish liver oil and oat bran. They caught on briefly, especially among the younger set. But after a group of youngsters posing as salesmen used the footwear as a ruse to get women to expose their calves, the shoes were banned in this country because of their association with gang activity.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1925, a year after the intellectual Finn Paavo Nurmi's double victory at the 1924 Olympics, an American scientist called Irving Piltdown made his contribution to running-shoe design.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurmi had a habit of running against, not his competitors, but the clock, carrying a stopwatch during races to measure himself against pre-set goals. Inspired by the Platonic theory of forms and spurred on by Nurmi's success, Piltdown, himself a runner, set out to design the perfect running shoe. After thousands of designs, all of them inconclusive, he gave up his search in 1931. He spent the rest of his time trying to find a way to get sunlight from cucumbers, attempting to prove motion was not an illusion, and designing domed playing fields.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the middle part of this century, the greatest runner was Czechoslovakia's brutally hard-training Emil Zatopek, a triple winner (5,000 and 10,000 meters and the marathon) at the 1952 Olympic Games. Czechoslovakians are used to hardships, because, as part of the Soviet Bloc, they were forced to read Russian literature.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954 a youngster named Brad Dunsel allegedly developed a shoe that would stand up under the hardest training, but he was crushed into a wafer after he allowed a B-17 bomber to be lowered onto his shoulders while wearing the shoes in 1955.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am always amazed and&nbsp;a tiny bit impressed when I meet someone who is way ahead of the curve when it comes to spotting a trend.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've met them, too: The woman who invented the idea of wearing running shoes with a business suit. Or the man who realized that ponytails and earrings are not just for women only.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free-lance trend spotters, you might call them, these people who have a natural ability to sense a trend coming in and to ride it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while I am not a person who falls into this category I still don't get, for instance, the torn-at-the-knees thing with jeans or why it's cool to say &quot;okay?&quot; at the end of every sentence I think I have spotted a real trend. Finally.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it is: Americans, I am convinced, are getting up earlier and earlier.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my first inkling of this when for reasons I'd rather not divulge except to say it's a wise person who never runs out of cat food when she's about to leave on a weekend trip without her cats I wound up at the neighborhood supermarket at 5 o'clock. IN THE MORNING<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, where I expected to find empty aisles and lineless checkout counters, I was shocked to find instead many dozens of people shopping and milling about. I watched in a dazed, Stepford-People kind of way, as they threw groceries into their carts. Stunned, I asked several of them why they were shopping at 5 o'clock. IN THE MORNING<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority responded that it was part of their usual routine.  That it was the only time they had available for grocery shopping.  (A very small minority, incidentally, did cite &quot;cat problems&quot; as a contributing factor in their predawn shopping.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving home about 5:45 a.m., I noticed small but significant numbers of people on the streets. Running. Jogging. Walking.  Skipping. Others, carrying little duffel bags marked with such names as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Adidas, were getting into their cars.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, at the workplace, I queried my colleagues about their morning schedule. Six out of six responded they arose before 7 a.m. Two of the men responded their working wives arose even earlier before 6 a.m. When asked why, the following reasons were cited: to swim, to do aerobics, to run, to read the newspapers, to get children ready for the day and, in the cases of the two working wives, to start their work day early so they could end it early.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A poll reports that 40 percent of Americans are up by 6:15 and 65 percent arise by 7 a.m. a significant rise from figures reported 15 years ago when 30 percent of Americans were up by 6:15 and 51&nbsp; percent arose before 7 a.m.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you're probably wondering, why are we becoming a nation of early risers? Well, according to studies done and anecdotal material from anyone who was willing to talk to me here are the four major reasons: more babies, more working mothers, more people growing older and more people making longer commutes to work.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you probably want to know isn't this up-at-dawn lifestyle making everyone sleepier? Are we as a nation in danger not only of a budget deficit but of a sleep deficit?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is: No. See, what's happening is everybody's going to bed earlier. That's why you hear so many people calling in their dogs at 10 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. And why so many TV stations are moving their news programs from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. And why restaurants. . . .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But . . . ZZZZZ . . . that's . . . ZZZZZZ . . . another . . . ZZZZZZZZZZ . .  . story.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Palmer sat at the wheel of her black Lexus sedan and steamed as two rows of bumper-to-bumper traffic nudged along behind her.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big marquise-cut diamond on her left hand sizzled as she held up the offending Sarasota newspaper ad, clearly stating that the new Gulf Coast Factory Shops opened at 10 a.m. Friday. It was now 10:30 a.m. and two men were turning away hundreds of cars, telling upset drivers that the ad should have said noon, not 10.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They made a lot of enemies by sending us on this wild-goose chase,&quot; she said. &quot;We may not be back.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched the cars a moment, then added: &quot;I heard they have Donna Karan in there. Do they?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she learned that the expensive New York women's clothier did have a shop in the new factory outlet center, Palmer bit her lower lip and slumped back into the car seat.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't always smooth Friday, but most of the thousands of people who came from all over west-central Florida endured the inevitable miscommunications, overflowing parking lots and hot, humid weather to look for that cherished prize: a deal.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talmadge Mathews, pastor of Ellenton's Church on the Rock, leaned on the lectern, drew close to the microphone and told the crowd gathered for the ribbon cutting: &quot;It's always a special time when we embark on a new start . . .&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once breaking her long, loping stride, a woman in a pale green tank top appeared from the parking lot, cut through the crowd and crossed right in front of Mathews, her gaze firmly fixed on Donna Karan's front door. She quickly reached it, but a look of bitter disappointment crossed her face when she discovered the door was still locked.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a few minutes later, Mike Reschke, president of the company developing Gulf Coast Factory Shops, proclaimed, &quot;The stores are now open. Enjoy yourselves. Thank you.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right &quot; a man said as the crowd quickly melted toward favorite storefronts.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bugle Boy children's clothing store, the Leather Loft, the Maidenform lingerie outlet, the Welcome Home shop all were jammed within minutes and stayed that way. People looked longingly at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etienne Aigner and Mikasa storefronts, which won't open until late next week.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen Meade of Bradenton reached into her Bugle Boy bag and held up her fistful of bargains, $ 9.99 boys tank tops being unloaded for 99 cents. Shorts that were $ 17 now sell for $ 9.99. But other prices in other stores were no better than a good sale at one of the region's retail department stores, she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she return?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm coming back tonight with my daughter when she gets out of school,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;She's a teen-ager and growing fast.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model Charlotte Nielsen caused quite a stir when she emerged from Donna Karan in a red silk miniskirt suit. She walked easily through the crowd in the $ 900 suit selling for half that amount.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1 p.m., the mostly older crowd was giving way to young moms with baby strollers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few people seemed to be carrying lots of bags. Store personnel acknowledged that sales weren't especially hot, that comparison pricing seemed to be the order of the day. They predicted heavier sales over the weekend.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 36 shops opening this week and next are south of Tampa Bay at Interstate 75 and U.S. 301 in Ellenton. Reschke, the developer, told the crowd he hopes to draw on the millions of people that visit west-central Florida each year or who regularly use I-75 to traverse the state.  @ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using other outlet shopping centers as guides, he said the typical shopper drives three to four hours to reach the center, then spends another three to four hours shopping. By contrast, a shopper normally spends less than an hour at a regional retail store. Reschke predicted the Ellenton outlets will generate $ 3-million in state sales tax revenues each year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen Eisenberg of Boston, visiting her parents in Bradenton, wasn't worried about tax revenues. She held up a cable-knit sweater she'd just bought at the Cape Isle Knit Shop and showed the tag, marked down from $ 78 to $ 59.99. &quot;It seemed like they had nice things that weren't too expensive,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she added, she was en route to the Coach Leatherware shop, where things can get very pricey. She had found a leather address book 20 percent cheaper than the same item back home not exactly the end of the world, &quot;but it's better than paying retail.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honest Abe Lincoln, staring down from his monument, is not the capital's top tourist draw. Nor is the White House, or even the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in a region liberally sprinkled with museums and monuments, what really packs 'em in is a shopping mall, 20 miles south of the Mall, in suburban Virginia.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 200 stores bragging about bargain prices, Potomac Mills discount mall draws more than 12-million people a year. They come for garbage cans and handbags, for lingerie and leather coats, for Swedish furniture and Icelandic sweaters. The deals are the draw.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That success of the country's first discount megamall has inspired imitation elsewhere, including Fort Lauderdale. A smaller outlet mall opened Friday near Bradenton. Now that retailing trend inspires wistful what-ifs from the people who are trying to salvage St. Petersburg's downtown redevelopment project, Bay Plaza.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original concept for Bay Plaza, as a high-fashion shopping and entertainment district, is stuck in the quicksand of recession and troubles in the department-store trade. What if Bay Plaza lowered its sights and its price-range, and became an outlet or off-price district?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee Fowler, vice president of the developer that is in charge of Bay Plaza, said his company still is convinced the original concept would work, but also is considering the outlet option. &quot;We still have a lot of homework to do,&quot; he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Means, a real estate consultant in suburban Washington, was fairly skeptical about Bay Plaza's chances when she studied the project three years ago, and she is not surprised to hear it is having trouble. But she calls an outlet mall &quot;an intriguing prospect&quot; for replacement.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, the very problems that have dimmed the prospects for the original Bay Plaza plan actually improve the chances for an outlet mall, where the key word is cheap: cheap land, cheap construction, cheap rents and especially cheap prices.<BR> Potomac Mills<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Although it is no longer the country's largest (Sawgrass Mills, outside Fort Lauderdale, was built by the same developer and is nearly twice the size) Potomac Mills remains a model for how outlet malls can work. At 1.2-million square feet, it is the same size as the original Bay Plaza retail plan.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first blush, Potomac Mills seems much like any other suburban mall, but with more parking outside and less finish inside. Steel roof beams and air conditioning ducts are exposed, for example.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big difference is the kind of stores: manufacturers' outlets and discount shops that routinely mark down prices. Benetton, Laura Ashley, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Calvin Klein all have stores there. So do some big department stores, including Nordstrom's and Sears.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all accounts, the biggest draw is a rambling Swedish furniture and housewares store called IKEA.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchandise runs the price-range gamut. You can buy a six-pack of Coca-Cola for $ 1.20. For bigger budgets, designer jeans by Escada that were on sale in St. Petersburg this summer for $ 200 a pair were a comparative bargain at $ 79 in a Potomac Mills store.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the stuff is first-quality; some of it is flawed, or last season's line.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A record store had the latest compact disc from the rock group Guns N' Roses for $ 11.99, a dollar less than a chain of stores in Washington. But this sign in a Guess? outlet is also fairly typical: &quot;No returns or exchanges. Merchandise as is. All sales final.&quot; A store whose slogan is &quot;Clothing Bargains for Millionaires&quot; had a Wells Fargo security guard instead of a floor-walker posted inside the front door.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the promise of good prices pulls shoppers from miles, even hundreds of miles, away. Potomac Mills sits next to I-95, and the parking lot is spotted with cars from other states, including Florida.  Last year, 2,357 buses disgorged tour groups at the mall, accounting for a quarter of total sales.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, according to the developer, Potomac Mills registered more than $ 200-million in sales last year, creating 2,500 jobs and $ 10-million in sales and property taxes for state and local government.<BR> St. Petersburg<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Those kinds of figures sound good almost anywhere, but especially in downtown St. Petersburg, where the number of department stores is headed in the wrong direction.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, a feasibility study of Bay Plaza commissioned by the St.  Petersburg Times concluded, among other things, that &quot;Tampa Bay isn't a Neiman-Marcus kind of place, at least not yet.&quot; Upscale stores need upscale shoppers. In all of Pinellas County, there are 35 houses appraised for taxes at $ 1-million or more; there are 159 such residences in Broward County, which is only somewhat larger.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the authors of that 1988 study says now that outlet shopping might be a better fit for the area, especially in these troubled times. &quot;I don't think it's going to be an easy thing to do, but it's not undoable,&quot; said consultant Means.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means and other real estate experts identify several important hurdles for outlet mall developments, but none of those hurdles seems impossibly high for the Bay Plaza project. The opening of Gulf Coast Factory Shops near Bradenton this week gives the region its third outlet center, although it is not clear how much they would compete with Bay Plaza, especially if it were much bigger.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tampa Bay area has a big population base and attracts plenty of tourists. It's reasonably easy for all those people to reach St.  Petersburg on the two interstate feeders, north and south of downtown. City Hall's commitments, financial and otherwise, to Bay Plaza would be another plus, according to the real estate experts.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent economic reverses actually improve the chances for an outlet mall downtown. Maas Brothers' decision to close its department store reduces one potential obstacle: reluctance by manufacturers to set up shop in competition with the department stores that are buying their products wholesale.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important is how much the recession may have depressed land values, and therefore store rents.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offer low prices, outlet stores have to have low rents, no more than half what they would pay somewhere else. That's why the huge outlet malls are out in places that used to be the boondocks, where land is cheap. The developers at Potomac Mills, for example, paid about $ 1 a square foot for land, a fraction of downtown costs.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cities have smaller outlet centers downtown, but they tend to be in renovated factories or mills that had gone bust. Again, one key to the success of an outlet mall is the value of the land beneath it, and in downtown St. Petersburg, the trend line is still headed down.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county property appraiser has dropped the valuation of the Florida Federal office tower from $ 27-million to $ 16-million in just three years, according to David Zachem, the appraiser's chief deputy. Office vacancy rates downtown are apt to be at 40 percent this year, he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure anybody can tell you with authority&quot; what downtown land values are now, said Zachem. &quot;They have not stabilized yet.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the recession, land values downtown still are several times higher than in outlying areas. But commercial rent rates have plummeted, and now may be nearing a range that just might attract outlet stores.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't even hazard a guess about what market rates are in downtown St. Petersburg right now,&quot; said Fowler. He wouldn't disclose what rents Bay Plaza was quoting to potential retail tenants. &quot;What we were thinking of and what we were quoting were two different things.&quot;<BR> The right developer<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;If St. Petersburg does try to turn Bay Plaza into an outlet mall, it might need a new developer, perhaps in partnership with the current one.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate experts interviewed for this article said that it takes particular expertise and the right connections to put together an outlet mall. Which stores come to a project depends very much on which developer is behind it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a very small fraternity of developers who are capable of pulling these things off,&quot; said Patrick Phillips of Halcyon Real Estate Advisors in Washington. &quot;Outlet retailing has its own rules and its own relationships. The rules are changing almost daily.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay Plaza's current developer, J.C. Nichols Co. of Kansas City, Mo., built a successful high-fashion shopping district called Country Club Plaza, which is the model for Bay Plaza. But Nichols is not among the handful of developers with substantial background in outlet malls.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partnership with a more experienced outlet developer is &quot;one of the things that we're exploring,&quot; said Fowler, but &quot;I won't be able to comment on the specifics of how we're exploring it.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, a downtown project goes through more than one developer before it finally succeeds. In downtown Chattanooga, Tenn., it took a third developer to make an outlet project called Warehouse Row work. That company was the Prime Group, which just opened the Manatee County center.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if all the other obstacles to an outlet mall project can be resolved, St. Petersburg would face one last question, a central one at that: What if outlet malls turn out to be a fad instead of a trend, replaced a few years from now by some hot new kind of retailing?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, outlet malls like Potomac Mills look economically secure, and developers say demographic and other trends will assure their continued success.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Outlet has been pretty strong for the last nine years,&quot; said Fowler, of Bay Plaza. &quot;I don't think it's a flash in the pan.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, an outlet mall would be the third theory for a retail project in downtown St. Petersburg during the last decade.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years ago, St. Petersburg voters rejected Pier Park, a proposal for a &quot;festival marketplace&quot; along the waterfront. Since then, similar projects have hit financial hard times in some of the other cities where they were built.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cities tend to look for panaceas&quot; to their downtown economic problems, said Phillips, of Halcyon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a real trap that cities can fall into.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida State Seminoles will join the nation's college basketball elite with their entrance this season into the Atlantic Coast Conference.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they can succeed right away at that level won't be known for several months. But coach Pat Kennedy started trying to answer several questions with the beginning of practice Tuesday. And even he is unsure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have a lot of question marks,&quot; said Kennedy, who enters his sixth season at FSU with a 97-56 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think there are obvious ones: How quickly and how well can the kids adjust to Sam (Cassell) as the lead (point) guard? Is Andre Reid going to develop into a full-time center? How is this lack of depth going to affect us? And I think our lack of inside depth is going to force us to look at more three-guard situations.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seminoles have talent, and they've found themselves in the hunt for some of the nation's top recruits because of their affiliation with the ACC. But Kennedy admits the Seminoles lack depth, with the two seniors on his roster expected to be nothing more than backups.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassell, a transfer from San Jacinto (Texas) Junior College, is projected as the starter at point guard. The team's leading scorer, Douglas Edwards (16.4 ppg), returns at small forward and will be joined by power forward Rodney Dobard (8.5 ppg), Reid at center (1.9 ppg) and shooting guard Chuck Graham (10.9 ppg).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is depth. Senior guard Derrick Myers left the program last week, so Kennedy is looking at freshman Ray Donald from Pensacola as his first guard off the bench.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampa's Byron Wells, who has beefed up to 230 pounds, is now considered the sixth man, although he's seen only limited action in the past and redshirted last year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: The Seminoles on Tuesday received a verbal commitment from Erick Dortch, a 6-foot-6 swingman from Pensacola High School who is considered among the top 10 prospects in the country by two prep scouting magazines, Hoop Scoop and Future Stars.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dortch averaged 23.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, three steals and two assists per game last season. He was one of only five Floridians chosen for the prestigious </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prep All-Star camp in Indianapolis.  The first day national letters of intent can be signed is Nov. 15.<BR> BOB HARIG<BR> Kruger has rebuilt Gators<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAINESVILLE They assembled at courtside in midafternoon for the first practice of the season. They brought with them high tops and high hopes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they could have brought name tags to pin on their tank tops, as well.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1991 University of Florida basketball team will bear little resemblance to the outfit that won the Southeastern Conference title in 1989. It will, for that matter, bear little resemblance to the squad that coach Lon Kruger trotted onto the court in his first season in 1990.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 15 players on the roster, 10 have joined since Kruger's arrival in April 1990. Florida could end up starting as many freshmen as seniors this season.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The personality of this club will be unique. It'll be different from last year. We've got a lot of young guys that are out to make a start as opposed to older guys finishing out careers.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no more Livingston Chatman. No more Dwayne Davis. No more Renaldo Garcia for the Gators.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will also be no more talk in the locker room about the good old days before the NCAA investigation and the tenuous tenures of Norm Sloan and Don DeVoe.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gators finished 11-17 last season. Not exactly a record to be proud of, but certainly better than the 7-21 mess of the year before.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gators lack experience: Forward Stacey Poole is the only returning full-time starter. They lack height: Jeremy Ulmer (6-7) and Tim Turner (6-7) are early front-runners at center and they combined to average 2.7 points and 1.8 rebounds last season.  Andrew DeClercq, 6-10 freshman from Countryside, is also a strong contender at center.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least this team is heading somewhere. It may not be a fast break, but the Gators are no longer sliding into oblivion.<BR> JOHN ROMANO<BR> Old Bulls in a new league<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAMPA While optimism is always at a zenith on the first day of practice, you'll have to pardon the University of South Florida Bulls for being especially upbeat.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USF returns four senior starters guard Radenko Dobras, center Gary Alexander and forwards Fred Lewis and Bobby Russell from a team that finished 19-11, beat three NCAA Tournament participants and earned an NIT berth.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This team is clearly the most experienced we've had here,&quot; Bulls coach Bobby Paschal said, &quot;and it's clearly had the most good experiences together.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bulls are entering a new ring: the Metro Conference, where they, North Carolina-Charlotte and Virginia Commonwealth join national powerhouses Louisville and Southern Mississippi.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Metro games, the Bulls face perhaps their most demanding non-conference schedule in years: Florida State, Florida, Cincinnati, home-and-home with Texas Christian, and a potential game against Iowa in USF's Holiday Invitational.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all these expectations prompted about 3,000 fans to attend Tuesday's Midnight Madness celebration at the Sun Dome.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to see Alexander, a relentless rebounder (10.2 a game) and inside scorer (16.4 points), who this year may discard his cumbersome knee brace; Lewis, the captain; and Dobras, the 6-foot-7 guard from Yugoslavia who has led USF in scoring his first three years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players worth watching, however, might be the newcomers.  Point guard Corey Allen, an All-American at Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College last year, could allow Dobras to move back to the shooting-guard spot.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick Sharp, the Florida Junior College player of the year last year at Brevard Community College; Gerard Arcement, a junior from Skyline (Calif.) Community College; and Mike Greene, a freshman from Miami Killian High, should bolster the Bulls' perimeter game and open up the inside for Alexander and Lewis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We always have high expectations,&quot; Paschal said. &quot;That expectation has not changed at any time. But we're optimistic if we play hard as a team, we can have a reasonable level of success.&quot;<BR> BRIAN LANDMAN<BR> Team rosters, page 2C<BR></SPAN></P>

The issue has been controversial for months, ever since the commission discussed banning live-aboards. But after an outcry from angry boaters, the commission has worked with boat owners to draft alternative regulation, he said. &quot;It's a very legal issue,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Federal and state (law) all get involved in what you can do and cannot do.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 miles north of Tampa, just off Interstate 75, is a sleepy little area of hills and orange groves called San Antonio.  Developers have yet to &quot;improve&quot; it. Miles of sandy roads spider past quiet farms. A small Catholic college, Saint Leo, is there. One can sit quietly, smell the orange trees when in blossom, maybe chat with one of the monks or nuns, or listen to the sweet chiming of the bell tower. It is also a good place to run.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Oct. 19, a mass of runners descended on San Antonio for the 1991 Rattlesnake Run, a 5-mile, part-road, part-field, all-hill endurance test.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Petersburg's Ray Wunderlich III aced the exam with a 25:55 winning time. Wunderlich (with splits of 5:02, 10:16, 15:22, 20:32) broke away from Mexican Omar Albanil Marta with a strong surge just before two miles, then hung on for the victory.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wunderlich, who works for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said: &quot;I threw in a surge and when he didn't respond, I knew I had it. These hills were tough tougher than Lake to Lake (10K).&quot; Wunderlich placed fifth in the Lakeland race two weeks ago in 31:37.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry Fluke of Tampa took second in 27:27, followed by Plant High School cross-country coach Roy Harrison in 27:30. &quot;I've only been able to do one speed workout this week (4x880) and I just didn't have it to challenge Fluke at the end. I do most of my running with my girls,&quot; said Harrison. His girls team won the Don Bishop Invitational in Brandon later that day.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesuit coach Dave Parrish, returning from injury, followed closely for fourth in 27:37. Marta, who recently finished a tour with the Mexican Army and is working in construction in Tampa, faded to fifth in 27:56. Former Tampa Catholic star Mark Bokor (third in the state in Class 3A cross country last year) finished sixth in 28:00.  Bokor is currently red-shirting a year at Saint Leo.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The footing on this course was tough,&quot; said lawn service owner Dave Mitchell of Temple Terrace. Mitchell is a middle-of-the-pack runner who likes the challenge. &quot;I enjoy the camaraderie and the scenery is nice, but you don't have time to look at it. I especially like to party after the race. The guys who do this are great.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the women's division, masters runner Dianna Campbell won overall in a time of 32:49. Campbell, 42, of Lakeland, recently returned to college and is majoring in sports management at Florida Southern.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda Nigles finished second in 33:42; Peg Miller was third in 33:58.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

Miller said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys, who were not identified because their assailants are still at large, were walking along Idlewild Avenue near Manhattan Avenue about 4:45 p.m.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They became wary when a two-door, blue car cruised by and one of the passengers leaned out the window and heckled them, said Emily Price, the grandmother of one of the boys.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Price, the car rounded the corner and stopped, and the passengers got out and approached the boys.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They jumped on my grandson from the back, sprayed Mace in his eyes, and hit him on the back of the head with brass knuckles,&quot; she said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the attackers then stole the boy's gold chain, wristwatch, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoes, Miller said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the victims was seriously hurt, and they were taken home by a neighbor, Price said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My grandson was crying and couldn't see,&quot; she said. &quot;He walked to school this morning, but his father is going to pick him up.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price said she thinks her grandson, who works cutting grass and doing other jobs to earn money for his clothes, may have been singled out because he dresses nicely.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys said they did not know their attackers and could not give detailed descriptions, deputies said. Sheriff's officials said they were investigating.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Open Letter&quot; appeared last week on Page 1 of the San Antonio Light and on the cover of the San Antonio Express-News sports section, and it didn't mince words. &quot;I'm finally fed up,&quot; David Robinson wrote to Spurs owner Red McCombs. &quot;I tried talking to you in a civilized manner. But obviously you didn't respect that because nothing has been done. Flying commercially puts us at a distinct disadvantage, especially when every other team that has a legitimate shot at winning the world championship has their own plane and are sleeping in their own beds.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, something is being done now. McCombs and Spurs officials are taking bids until Dec. 20 for charter flights. And if it took publicly challenging the man who pays his salary to get the results, then so be it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new David Robinson, one you wouldn't recognize from the Naval Academy, one you wouldn't recognize even from mid-summer, simply because this David Robinson didn't exist then.  This Robinson, changed since he decided to dedicate himself to Christianity, is getting married in 10 days. This Robinson, unlike the quiet, reticent man the sports world grew so comfortable with, isn't afraid to ruffle feathers as the team's new bold, forceful leader.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could illustrate this metamorphosis more than the letter to McCombs, which Robinson never would have written last season &quot;I thought about it a lot after I was saved this summer,&quot; he said Wednesday night. &quot;I needed to exert some of my influence. Nobody should blame you for doing that if your intentions are good.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd been studying characters in the Old Testament, one in particular. When Moses died, the Lord told Joshua, &quot;Be strong, and no man will be able to touch you. Be strong and courageous because you will lead these people.' &quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson knows he runs a risk of turning off fans because so many don't feel comfortable hearing about one's religious beliefs or Bible verses. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; he said softly, nodding in agreement.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I used to think the same thing myself when some player started talking this way.&quot; And how do you justify quoting scripture on one hand, while publicly challenging the owner of the team on the other?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God doesn't want wimps,&quot; Robinson told the Light's Brad Townsend. &quot;He wants men. He wants warriors because this is not a joke. It's a war out there. It's a war between your soul and the devil.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson was observant and quiet, somewhat reluctant to be very vocal. Not now.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I talked to Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley this summer when we were in Europe for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Robinson said. &quot;They told me my team is immature, that we had no chance to win. I got defensive, but really it was true. I needed to do more, to really be strong and&nbsp; take control when needed.&quot;<BR> Other news<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockets: Hakeem Olajuwon was activated from the injured list Saturday, two days earlier than expected. The All-Star center hadn't been expected to rejoin the team until Tuesday in Portland.  Also Saturday, the club waived forward-center Dan Godfread, who was signed Nov. 29 to fill Olajuwon's spot on the roster.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nets: Derrick Coleman, in his third game back after an ankle injury, was upset with coach Bill Fitch for not using him until midway through the third quarter of Friday's 98-89 loss to the Lakers. &quot;Obviously, you don't leave your best player on the bench for three quarters and expect him to come in and turn it on in the fourth,&quot; said Coleman. &quot;You call that coaching? He knows the (left) ankle was okay. I felt good, I told him that. I was sitting, waiting, and wondered when I was going in the game.&quot;<BR> Information from Associated Press was used in this report.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teen-age girls danced and squealed as the rap group 3 Brothers Of Knowledge performed on a gym floor Friday afternoon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the abundance of fuzzy red-and-white Santa hats, it was hard to tell this was the day before the holiday break at Booker T. Washington Junior High School near Ybor City.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh-graders at the junior high were treated to a day of rap music and Japanese Taiko drumming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought it was going to be stupid,&quot; said Remecia Hardy, 13, of Tampa. &quot;But it's neat. I'm glad I came to school.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rap group, known as 3 B.O.K., encouraged the teens in their rap songs to come to school and stay away from drugs. They also tried to remind the pupils that although some of them were looking forward to Christmas mornings full of gifts such as Nintendos and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes, there were others who wouldn't be so lucky.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's Christmas, and you probably aren't thinking about the homeless,&quot; said group leader Greg Hunt, 21, of St. Petersburg, during a lull in the performance. &quot;But there are people who are starving throughout the year, and you need to remember them.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the pupils enjoyed the rap act, they weren't so sure about the Japanese Taiko Drummers, also from St. Petersburg. But they managed to keep the squirming and whispering to a minimum while Lorraine and Asoka Compton pounded on the giant drums.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For this age group, sitting still and listening to music that's not from their world, they did real well,&quot; said substitute teacher Linda Chappell. &quot;They seemed pretty enthralled by it.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pupils didn't come to school Friday. Instead, they started their holiday vacation a little early.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wasn't going to come. I was going to go to the mall,&quot; said Dante Lamar, 13, of Tampa. &quot;But my mom wouldn't let me stay home.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who came to school had similar plans of how to spend their time off: avoid studying (many left their books in their lockers) and sleep in.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way in,&quot; said Jackie Johnson, 12, from Valrico.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas wishes were tempered by economic reality, and most of the pupils acknowledged that they weren't asking their parents for as many things this Christmas.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My mom is a kindergarten teacher, and she's working all by herself,&quot; said Chris Girard, 13, from Brandon. Although his classmates were cheering and screaming to the rap in the gymnasium, Girard was near tears.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're really limited this year,&quot; he said. His father died in December last year, leaving his mother to care for him and his younger sister. &quot;We can't do as much as we want to do. My grandparents are helping out. We're not getting as much for Christmas. It's real hard, especially around the holidays.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY GERALD FITZPATRICK<BR>Special to The Globe and Mail<BR> MODERN Athens is noisy and polluted, its taxi drivers will often take you<BR>only where they want to go, but it has an incomparable jewel at its heart.<BR>Floating serenely above the concrete confusion is the rock of the<BR>Acropolis. On its flattened top, the most glorious ruins of antiquity look<BR>down from another age and at its pinnacle stands the Parthenon, often<BR>called the most perfect building in the world and the enduring symbol of<BR>Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Inhabited since Neolithic times, the Acropolis has been battered and<BR>fought over constantly. After it was devastated by the Persians in 480 BC,<BR>the statesman-general Pericles began to rebuild the Acropolis on a<BR>monumental scale. In this brief &quot;Golden Age,&quot; the Parthenon was completed<BR>in 438 BC, followed by the Propylaia, the Temple of Athena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the<BR>Erechtheion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For centuries, the city was occupied by a succession of conquerors who<BR>each added buildings and defences to the site. In 1687, during a long<BR>period of Turkish rule, the Acropolis was attacked by Venetian forces. An<BR>explosion rocked the Parthenon, which the Turks were using as a powder<BR>magazine. Fourteen columns were blown apart cutting the temple in two.<BR>Fire raged for two days and the Turks surrendered the site for several<BR>months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1833 the Turks were finally defeated and the modern Greek state was<BR>born. The new monarch, King Otho, wanted to build a new palace on the<BR>Acropolis, but fortunately his plans were rejected as too costly. Work<BR>soon began to remove the clutter of buildings that had been added to the<BR>Acropolis since classical times, and restoration has gone on almost<BR>continuously ever since. During the past 50 years, however, deterioration<BR>of the site from erosion has increased at an alarming rate. Iron<BR>reinforcing rods used in earlier restoration work caused serious marble<BR>damage, but the effects of sulphurous pollution have been even worse. Iron<BR>reinforcement is now being replaced by titanium, and copies of surviving<BR>sculptures have been substituted for the originals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stayed at the Hotel Phillipos, in the shadow of the Acropolis, on<BR>three occasions between visits to other parts of mainland Greece and the<BR>islands. Each time we returned we were given a room on a higher floor.<BR>During our last visit, we had a room with its own roof terrace that looked<BR>straight up at the south side of the Parthenon: we saw the ancient temple<BR>glow in the morning sun, glisten at midday and turn pink in the sunset. We<BR>saw it by moonlight and floodlight. It was a view of which we never tired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On our first morning, we climbed the worn marble steps leading to the<BR>ceremonial entrance of the Beule Gate. Beyond it was the Propylaia, a<BR>monumental gateway originally planned to extend across the entire width of<BR>the Acropolis. It was to be exactly as wide as the Parthenon was long, but<BR>work stopped when the Peloponnesian War broke out and the building was<BR>never finished. The Propylaia remained almost intact until the 13th<BR>century when it was used as a Byzantine palace. It was severely damaged by<BR>lightning when it too was used as a Turkish powder magazine in the 17th<BR>century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perched dramatically on a platform next to the south wing of the<BR>Propylaia is the little Temple of Athena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, one of the gems of the<BR>Acropolis, with an Ionic portico of slim fluted columns at either end.<BR>Built to celebrate the peace with Persia, it was destroyed by the Turks,<BR>reconstructed in the 1830s but dismantled and rebuilt again in the 1930s<BR>when its foundation became insecure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We walked through the Propylaia, and before us, at the highest point of<BR>the Acropolis, stood the Parthenon. Built to honour the goddess Athena<BR>Polias, it has 17 columns on each side and eight at either end, each more<BR>than two metres wide at their base and 10 metres high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precise mathematical skill that went into the design of the<BR>Parthenon is astonishing. It is said that there is not a single straight<BR>line in the entire building: horizontal lines that seem straight and true<BR>actually rise in the centre, while columns bulge half way up and then<BR>taper toward the top. Pericles ensured that the finest sculptors in Athens<BR>worked on the decorative friezes surrounding the temple. He succeeded so<BR>well that the Parthenon came to be looked upon by Athenians as an artistic<BR>masterpiece rather than as a holy place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the Venetian offensive, the temple survived more or less intact<BR>for about 2,000 years, serving in its time as a Christian church and a<BR>Muslim mosque - complete with a minaret. Sadly, the most serious damage<BR>came from the ravages of 18th century antiquarians who began to remove<BR>parts of the Parthenon's decorative friezes. The most flagrant example of<BR>this, which still angers the Greek people, was by Lord Elgin, the British<BR>ambassador to Turkey. In 1801, he was given permission to remove a large<BR>part of the frieze and other figures, which are now in the British Museum<BR>in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North of the Parthenon is the Erechtheion, the last temple built on the<BR>Acropolis, its fine detail acting as a delicate foil to the massive<BR>Parthenon. The Erechtheion's crowning feature is the south porch where the<BR>supporting columns are in the form of six maidens, called &quot;caryatids&quot;<BR>after the women of Karyai on the Peloponnese peninsula. During the Turkish<BR>occupation, the military governor housed his harem in the Erechtheion and<BR>the caryatids were said to have blushed with shame. In the 19th century,<BR>moulds were taken of the original caryatids, which have now been replaced<BR>with copies in order to prevent further deterioration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we travelled around Athens, I kept looking for glimpses of the<BR>Parthenon through the forest of television antennas bristling above the<BR>concrete buildings. On our last day in the city, I went back to the<BR>Acropolis for a final visit. It seemed to draw me like a magnet. In spite<BR>of the blinding sun and the crowds, I wanted to etch those images on my<BR>mind once more. As I left through the Propylaea, I turned and took one<BR>last lingering look. There the Parthenon sat, battered and worn after<BR>2,400 years. I tried to imagine people staring up at this same timeless<BR>building more than a thousand years ago. Called &quot;the emblem of<BR>civilization&quot; and &quot;the victory of order over chaos,&quot; the victory of the<BR>Acropolis' crowning gem seemed even more supreme as I took a deep breath<BR>and descended into the modern city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Economist<BR> WHEN, late last year, PepsiCo Inc. unveiled a new television commercial<BR>in the United States sneering at the products of its perennial rival,<BR>Coca-Cola Co., not an eyebrow was raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    By the rough and tumble standards of U.S. advertising, where corporate<BR>bosses inveigh against foreign competitors and food companies have been<BR>known to accuse one another of causing cancer, the Pepsi ad seemed gentle.<BR>In it, a sip of Coke turns M. C. Hammer, a rap-music star who normally<BR>sounds as if he has several bits of gravel lodged in his throat, into a<BR>syrupy crooner. A swig of Pepsi, naturally, returns him to form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tame stuff - or so it seemed until the commercial was broadcast in<BR>Japan. There it has sparked a furious legal row between the two companies,<BR>forcing the ad off the air after complaints to Japan's Fair Trade<BR>Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although comparative advertising has been legal in Japan since 1987, it<BR>is frowned upon. But some Japanese ad people say that if the trade<BR>commission rules in Pepsi's favour, it may become more acceptable. In<BR>parts of Europe, where the tactic is known as &quot;knocking copy,&quot; it already<BR>has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As comparative advertising grows ever more popular - and pointed - in<BR>the United States, governments around the world are under pressure to<BR>liberalize their rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That pressure is coming directly from most ad agencies and some of<BR>their clients. Increasingly they see comparative advertising as an<BR>effective way for new brands - especially fast-moving consumer goods - to<BR>break into markets, or for established but tired ones to regain lost<BR>market share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bolster their case, they cite famous American success stories such<BR>as Federal Express Corp., the overnight mail courier that established<BR>itself by knocking the leisurely U.S. Postal Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regulators remain wary. Free-market arguments supporting the free<BR>flow of consumer information and lower barriers to market entry must be<BR>balanced, they say, against the dangers of deceptive or slanderous ads and<BR>against &quot;intellectual property&quot; claims by companies over their branded<BR>images. In fact, comparative ads are not, in most cases, pernicious; but<BR>neither are they usually very effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The folly of the regulators can be seen most plainly in Europe.<BR>Yesterday, the European Commission approved a proposal ostensibly<BR>permitting comparative advertising in the European Community from 1993.<BR>But there is a catch, or rather, seven of them. All are limits that any<BR>advertiser would need to observe when knocking another brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, the restrictions in effect ban all but the narrowest -<BR>and most commercially fruitless - comparative ads. Pepsi's M. C. Hammer<BR>commercial would be doomed in the EC unless the company could produce<BR>scientific evidence of Coke's effect on Mr. Hammer's vocal chords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So would other image-based ads now in vogue in the United States, such<BR>as those in the entertaining war being waged against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.'s Air brand<BR>of athletic shoes by virtually all of its competitors. LA Gear Inc. chides<BR>&quot;Everything else is just hot air;&quot; British Knights, another competitor, is<BR>less artful: &quot;Your mother wears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparative advertising has been common in the United States since the<BR>mid-1960s. In that time, it has produced some of the country's most<BR>brilliant commercials - the Pepsi ad in which young people in the distant<BR>future find a relic (a Coke bottle) so ancient they cannot identify it;<BR>the famous ad for Wendy's, a fast-food restaurant, which jibed McDonald's<BR>hamburgers by asking &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What comparative advertising has not done is show that it helps to sell<BR>products. Pepsi still lags far behind Coke; Wendy's does not have half of<BR>McDonald's market share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are exceptions. According to research by Leo Burnett, a Chicago-<BR>based agency, a clever, well-executed comparative ad can be particularly<BR>helpful in two circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is establishing a new brand against entrenched rivals:<BR>General Mills Inc. successfully launched its breakfast cereal Total by<BR>saying it was the same as Kellogg Co.'s Corn Flakes but with more<BR>vitamins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is in a tightly contested market with lots of brands, where<BR>tiny short-term gains are needed to stay profitable. There are more than<BR>200 brands in the $900-million U.S. breakfast-cereal market; only 31 of<BR>them have more than 1 per cent of it. Hence the use of comparative ads by<BR>virtually all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the whole, says Chris Macrae, a brands consultant at Coopers<BR>Lybrand Deloitte, comparative advertising makes little sense for an<BR>established brand. &quot;The brands that last are those that define themselves<BR>positively, not in opposition to someone else,&quot; he argues. Market leaders<BR>often gain nothing by giving their rivals free exposure, while brands that<BR>knock market leaders tacitly admit they are not No. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, an extended slugging match can simply subtract value from the<BR>whole market. When Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. introduced Datril, a headache<BR>drug that it advertised as identical to Tylenol only cheaper, Tylenol<BR>reduced its prices, dooming Datril's campaign but reducing its own<BR>revenues as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years of back and forth in the United States between soybean and<BR>palm oil producers about the deleterious effects on health of each other's<BR>products did nothing but stop many people from buying all edible oils.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOANNE LIPMAN; WSJ</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1002 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JOANNE LIPMAN<BR>WALL STREET JOURNAL<BR> IF you think television commercials aren't as good as they used to be,<BR>you may be right. New U.S. research suggests that they are becoming less<BR>memorable, even as print advertising is holding relatively steady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A study by Video Storyboard Tests Inc., which tracks advertising<BR>popularity among consumers, found that the percentage of people who can<BR>name an outstanding TV campaign has plummeted over the past five years. In<BR>1986, 64 per cent of the people polled could, unaided, cite favourite<BR>campaigns - a figure that plunged to just 48 per cent by last year. At the<BR>same time, print advertising's memorability has hovered in the range of 26<BR>to 31 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, the most memorable print campaigns are the ones that<BR>have lasted the longest and spent the most money on splashy multiple-page<BR>spreads. Among them: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Calvin Klein, Camel, Revlon and Absolut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisers have written off print, but the numbers clearly show that<BR>dollar for dollar, it is becoming a better value than TV advertising, says<BR>David Vadehra, Video Storyboard's president. And it's becoming better<BR>every day: TV advertising's cost increases continue to far outpace those<BR>of print, despite TV's dwindling memorability, data from ad agency McCann-<BR>Erickson show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad executives say TV advertising in the United States is suffering as<BR>viewers zap ads, turn to video cassettes and are just plain overwhelmed by<BR>the clutter of commercials on network, local and cable stations. At the<BR>same time, TV ads are more frequently substituting glitz and fancy<BR>photography for good ideas, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard &quot;to find a really badly executed piece of TV advertising any<BR>more, but it's very easy to find a lot of irrelevant, rotten ideas,&quot; says<BR>Martin Purls, chief executive officer and president of ad agency Ammirati<BR>&amp; Purls, which created the Ultimate Driving Machine campaign for BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Print advertising, meanwhile, particularly in magazines, is getting<BR>more sophisticated as marketers learn to make better use of the less<BR>expensive medium. The most important lesson they've learned: consistency.<BR>A look at Video Storyboard's top 10 U.S. print campaigns for 1990 shows<BR>that most are at least three years old and several have been running for<BR>more than a decade. There isn't a limited-run campaign in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marlboro cigarettes, for one, has been a top-10 staple in the United<BR>States for years, thanks to the Marlboro Man cowboy: he was introduced by<BR>ad agency Leo Burnett back in 1954. And Absolut vodka's award-winning<BR>campaign took a full decade to make the grade. It made its debut in the<BR>top-10 list at No. 5 this year, although the distinctive campaign using<BR>artists' renditions of Absolut bottles and puns like &quot;Absolut perfection&quot;<BR>has been running since 1981. Guess jeans' black-and-white photographs of<BR>sex kittens, and Camel's cartoon mascot, the butt-puffing Joe Camel, have<BR>also become fixtures in magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistency and continuity - that's the &quot;secret for magazines if you<BR>want to be visible,&quot; says Dick Costello, president and chief operating<BR>officer of Absolut's ad agency, TBWA. &quot;For us, that's the way to use<BR>print. It's a slow-building medium.&quot; Video Storyboard's Mr. Vadehra<BR>believes that &quot;in print, consistency is even more important than in TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making a big impression in print, while often cheaper than TV, still<BR>isn't for those with small pocketbooks. Most of the top-10 print campaigns<BR>used costly multipage ads, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Calvin Klein and Guess jeans.<BR>Special effects, such as the puzzle stamp and musical ads Absolut has run,<BR>can cost even more than TV advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending a lot of money in itself, though, is no guarantee that a print<BR>campaign will break through. While the big auto makers are all major print<BR>advertisers, only two of them, Infiniti at No. 6 and Ford at No. 9, made<BR>the top 10. Infiniti stood out because of its controversial campaign using<BR>zen-inspired nature scenes to introduce the car, Mr. Vadehra says. Ford<BR>made the cut, he says, because its ads, unlike those of its competitors,<BR>use the same distinctive layout and logo to tout all its product lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Print remains a tough sell, though. For clients and ad agency<BR>executives alike, the glitz of TV is too alluring to ignore. Print<BR>advertising, solid but so often unexciting, runs a distant second choice.<BR>Advertisers often &quot;feel the 'second team' (at an ad agency) works on print<BR>ads. When I was on the agency side, everyone wanted to work on TV,&quot; says<BR>Bill Landgraf, director of media planning for Kraft General Foods, one of<BR>the largest advertisers in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ammirati &amp; Purls's Mr. Purls sees that phenomenon daily. Last year, he<BR>considered hiring a senior creative executive at a salary of more than<BR>$200,000. Then he asked to see the man's print work. &quot;He doesn't do<BR>print,&quot; came the reply. &quot;There's an attitude,&quot; Mr. Purls says. He didn't<BR>hire the executive, and he says that the attitude problem helps explain<BR>why the quality of some print advertising &quot;is appalling. It's basic human<BR>nature and greed. They want to do TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magazines and newspapers are trying desperately to prove that print ads<BR>can be as effective as TV commercials, or even more so. Family Circle, a<BR>publication of the New York Times Co. Magazine Group, recently completed a<BR>study of nearly 100,000 households in which it tracked purchases of 22<BR>brands advertised in the magazine over 28 weeks. It found that households<BR>buying the magazine spent 7 per cent more a week on groceries than a<BR>control group and that sales of products advertised in the magazine<BR>increased for 15 of the 22 brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Print advertising can be a highly effective means of increasing<BR>product sales,&quot; concludes Rebecca McPheters, a magazine group vice-<BR>president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Translating that into an increase in print advertising, though,<BR>promises to be tricky. &quot;We certainly need to look at more than just TV<BR>alone,&quot; Kraft General Foods' Mr. Landgraf concedes. But, he adds,<BR>&quot;publishers have long felt the creative product going into magazines<BR>wasn't as high a standard as television - and I think their estimations<BR>are correct.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">869 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JOHN BARBER<BR> Special to The Globe and Mail<BR> &quot;BOY, am I on a roll,&quot; exclaimed graphic designer Rick Valicenti, pausing<BR>in mid-tangent to comment on the weird and unexpected directions his<BR>Monday evening lecture at Harbourfront was taking. &quot;And,&quot; he added, &quot;I<BR>have no way of knowing where I'm going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Mr. Valicenti, a speaker in Virtu's Centrifuge lecture series, had no<BR>idea where he was going because he had mounted the podium armed with<BR>little more than a collection of recent newspaper clippings and a promise<BR>to &quot;try to catch a stream of consciousness.&quot; The stream he caught took him<BR>from the Buddha's sayings to the mystery of flea-market toothpick holders,<BR>from the winemaking skills of Francis Ford Coppola to the motives of<BR>neighbours bearing casseroles. &quot;If you want me to speak specifically about<BR>graphic design,&quot; he said, &quot;we can do that later.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Valicenti's audience of young graphic designers wasn't in the least<BR>disappointed with the impish designer's &quot;Zen Rick&quot; shtick, however. He is<BR>a hero who could have lectured in Esperanto to a rapt audience. That is<BR>because at 39, Mr. Valicenti has accomplished something every one of them<BR>yearns to do: he has risen to the very top of his profession without the<BR>slightest compromise to his own highly original and personal style of<BR>design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the creative force behind the Chicago studio Thirst, Mr. Valicenti<BR>came to Toronto billed as one of America's &quot;cutting edge&quot; graphic<BR>designers. Certainly the slides he used to accompany his lecture, along<BR>with a recently self-published booklet of his work, substantiated that<BR>claim. Here there is little distinction between graphic and fine art: a<BR>portrait of rap star Vanilla Ice as a pimple-faced, dragon-tongued culture<BR>thief, several Cubist meditations on a gum wrapper, a dictionary shredded<BR>messily by a chainsaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes Mr. Valicenti's images are accompanied by a jokey text<BR>written in the idiom of a vanity licence plate. Thus his studio, Thirst,<BR>becomes 3st; his booklet is THISRT and his motto, BEZ. His quirky use of<BR>type combines a modernist's fascination with type's abstract shapes and a<BR>child's lofty indifference to all established conventions regarding its<BR>use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Valicenti didn't show was much of his commercial work, which<BR>on the evidence he provided is only slightly more conventional. Many of<BR>his clients (including Gilbert Paper, the contract furniture company<BR>Steelcase and Cooper Lighting) direct their advertising to designers and<BR>are therefore more willing to take risks. &quot;Their threshhold for pain is<BR>much higher than everyone else's,&quot; Mr. Valicenti jokes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how can a man who was recently contracted by a Japanese candy<BR>company to design a Valentine's Day series of chocolates - called Rick<BR>Valicenti's Gentle Manhattan Love - fail to become a star? Especially when<BR>one of the bonbons is a pink-coloured chocolate screw with a heart-shaped<BR>head?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the images Mr. Valicenti did choose, which included everything<BR>from Soviet Constructivist El Lissitzky's business card to a detail from<BR>Michelangelo's Pieta, revolved in a cryptic, Zen-like way around the issue<BR>of integrity. &quot;It's very easy to forget why you participate in a<BR>profession,&quot; he told a questioner, &quot;because as soon as you are<BR>participating you encounter people who want to beat you up.&quot; Resisting<BR>them is only half the battle. The goal, says Mr. Valicenti, is to<BR>&quot;transcend our real purpose, satisfy all our constraints and delight at<BR>the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's so much stuff that abuses humans in the name of greed, and we<BR>as graphic designers wrestle with that all the time. Are we mercenaries?<BR>Odds are we are. But on some level we have to draw the line and say, 'Hey,<BR>we can still sell your product to all those people who are 25 to 35 years<BR>old and white and go shopping with a grocery cart - we can still sell more<BR>of it than the competition - but in doing that maybe we can also help by<BR>giving them something of real value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It beats just making &quot;more fodder for the landfill.&quot; But it's still a<BR>limited ambition, and for the time being it plays to a limited audience.<BR>Mr. Valicenti knew he ran the risk of losing his audience when he founded<BR>Thirst in 1988, after working on a catalogue for French designer Philippe<BR>Starck, and committed himself wholly to his own vision. In fact, most of<BR>the clients who loved the work of R. Valicenti Design couldn't stomach<BR>Thirst. But the designer had started on the path that quickly carried him<BR>to the top echelon of his profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he dreams of carrying his uncompromised personal vision to the<BR>mass market. &quot;I'm so anxious now for an opportunity to do something that<BR>has a large audience,&quot; he says. For months, he daydreamed about doing a<BR>television campaign for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Then, last Thursday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called and asked<BR>to see his portfolio. His delight in the call is mixed with dread. &quot;I have<BR>a feeling there's going to be so many account executives preceding every<BR>presentation that my involvement with the client is just going to get lost<BR>in space,&quot; he says. &quot;But I hope I can extend my esthetic to speak to a<BR>huge audience, and I hope it will have the same kind of integrity behind<BR>it.&quot; One thing is for sure: transposing the graphic insights of Zen Rick<BR>to the mass market won't BEZ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY LESLIE C. SMITH<BR> LAST weekend, I asked my nephew, who is turning five, what he wanted for<BR>his birthday. In an excited tone, Owen replied: &quot;You know what Daddy's<BR>getting me? Basketball shoes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It seems to start young, this predilection for athletic footwear. I can<BR>remember myself, close to Owen's age, watching with mouth agape an<BR>American television ad for Keds sneakers. A group of bad guys was chasing<BR>a kid who, thanks to his rubber-soled Keds, leapt right over an eight-foot<BR>chain-link fence and escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gosh, I wanted those shoes. I believed in them, the same way I believed<BR>that drinking whole milk and eating Wonder Bread would endow me with<BR>bulging biceps. When at last I got my own pair of Keds, I tried my best to<BR>leap over tall fences, but the magic was not there. I was left with vague<BR>feelings of inadequacy: Was I to blame, or was it the shoes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's running shoes - and the TV ads for them - are more<BR>sophisticated. Sports superstars, famous directors and multi-million-<BR>dollar specialty stores have turned the simple sneaker into an air-padded,<BR>lug-soled, Zorbathane-inserted, high-priced must-have for kids and adults<BR>alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the message is the same. With a pair of high-top </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Force<BR>180s strapped to your feet, you too can play basketball like Michael<BR>Jordan. If you can't, it's not the shoes' fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what if you don't even play basketball? The point is, these shoes<BR>are cool. Boy or man, you can flash the design logo and impress your<BR>friends. Forget the questions: Will these shoes be good for walking around<BR>in? Or will they end up damaging my arches? Questions are for sissies. As<BR>the ads say, Just Do It. Spend the $180 plus taxes. Buy yourself or your<BR>child a not-so-cheap thrill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You realize that just doing it in Detroit could cost you your life. In<BR>many American inner-cities, a good pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is worth their weight in<BR>Rolex watches. You might as well hang a sign around your neck that says<BR>Mug Me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to be careful, too, how you do up your shoelaces. In the<BR>United States, the way they're tied can indicate gang affiliation. The<BR>coolest of the cool often leave their laces completely undone, a style<BR>derived from prison life where shoelaces are routinely removed to prevent<BR>suicide attempts. A neatly tied shoe, in contrast, is a sure sign of<BR>nerdiness whether south of the border or in more moderate Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are people who actually buy athletic shoes for use in sports.<BR>Spending over a hundred bucks for a pair might, to them, seem well worth<BR>the money. But as anyone who has recently visited a footwear store will<BR>testify, buying only one pair of athletic shoes is not easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may solve some of your selection problems by purchasing cross-<BR>trainers, but chances are you won't find a pair that cover all your<BR>sporting activities. What if you like tennis with a little weight-training<BR>on the side? Then you'll need two different pairs of shoes. For biking or<BR>hiking on weekends, another couple of pairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jogging shoe is a separate entity, as is the aerobics shoe. And<BR>just when you thought it was safe to go to the gym, along comes Reebok<BR>with its brand new Step Aerobics shoe. That's right, a training shoe for<BR>use solely in stepping up and down on a stair riser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I imagine that sooner rather than later, people will get fed up with<BR>the surfeit of athletic shoes on the market. Already, the style pundits<BR>are predicting a return to the simple, blue-and-white striped Adidas<BR>Gazelles that were so popular during the seventies. Me, I'm holding out<BR>for the original Keds runner. Some dreams never die.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, denied appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking relief from his rape and sexual assault convictions and life sentences. Appellant challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant was convicted of rape and sexual assault and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms. He sought habeas corpus relief, contending that his conviction was based upon the use of hypnotically enhanced testimony in violation of his constitutional rights and that the appellee failed to disclose the audio recordings and reports of the hypnosis despite his request for same. The trial court denied appellant's petition. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that appellee's failure to disclose the audio recordings and reports of the witnesses' hypnosis violated Brady principles and was therefore constitutionally prejudicial. The evidence was material because appellant's conviction rested substantially on the witnesses' identifications as there was little independent corroborating evidence. Despite one witness's contention that the hypnosis had no effect on her, the audio recording suggested that it may have been during hypnosis that she first identified appellant as her assailant. After hypnosis, the officer changed his description of appellant's clothing and appearance. This information could have been used by appellant to impeach the witnesses' testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to issue the writ of habeas corpus because appellee violated appellant's constitutional rights by failing to provide audio recordings and reports of its witnesses' hypnosis, which were material, as appellant requested.</SPAN></P>

First, the hypnotic session must be conducted by a psychiatrist or psychologist trained in the use of hypnosis.

Fourth, before hypnosis, the hypnotist should obtain a detailed description of the subject's current memory of the event. Fifth, the hypnosis session should be recorded -- video taping is strongly recommended -- so a permanent record exists to ensure against suggestive procedures.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant, Lesly Jean, was convicted of rape and sexual assault after trial by jury in North Carolina state court and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. After exhausting his state court appeals and post-conviction remedies, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, contending that his conviction was based on the use of hypnotically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enhanced testimony that violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and that the state failed to disclose the audio recordings and reports of the involved hypnosis, despite a specific request for such material, in violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Brady v. Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). The district court denied the writ. We reverse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning of July 21, 1982, Ms. Alice &quot;Kathy&quot; Wilson was raped and sexually assaulted. The incident occurred between 3:00 and 4:15 a.m. Ms. Wilson described her attacker as black, five feet eight inches tall, muscular, weighing about 165 or 170 pounds, with a close-cut marine haircut, kinky hair, and no facial hair. She added that he wore dark shorts, white crew socks and high-top sneakers. Ms. Wilson, however, acknowledged that she did not realize that her attacker was black until he told her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same morning, Officer James Shingleton stopped a man walking along the highway who fit the description of Wilson's assailant. He questioned the man for about one-and-one-half minutes, until the man fled into the neighboring woods. Shingleton did not get a good look at the suspect, as it was still nightfall and the only &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  light available was from his police car's flashing blue lights. Shingleton described the person as a black male, possibly having a beard or mustache, close-cut hair, about five feet ten inches tall, 170 pounds, wearing blue shorts, a blue shirt with writing, white knee socks and white high-top tennis shoes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning, Ms. Wilson met with police officials to create a &quot;composite&quot; drawing of the suspect, which was subsequently reproduced and immediately circulated throughout the police station. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police officials, however, decided not to reproduce a composite drawing based on Shingleton's description because the encounter had been too brief, the lighting too poor, and his description too vague. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">1&nbsp;At this meeting, Wilson added to her previous description that her attacker had small freckles scattered over his upper face, as well as a large spot somewhere on his left cheek, approximately the size of a dime. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because of the shortcomings in Shingleton's description, Captain Collins, head of the Detective Division, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hypnotized Shingleton on July 22, 1982. Collins' only training in this area had been a two-week course in investigative hypnosis at the North Carolina Justice Academy. During the hypnotic session, Shingleton's description of the man he stopped changed from his previous description. The design on the tee shirt became a sweat mark and the man was now clean-shaven. Shingleton also now remembered that the suspect had a baby-face, oval jaw, big lips, a big nose, glassy eyes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that there were blue stripes on his socks, white shoelaces, and the word &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; written on the sneakers. Collins audio taped the actual hypnosis, but he did not tape the pre- and post-hypnotic conversations. He also did not record his own knowledge of the case, nor did he record Shingleton's pre- and post-hypnotic knowledge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afterward, Shingleton emphasized that he believed that the hypnosis greatly helped his memory and that he had actually &quot;relived&quot; the night in question. Investigating officers concluded that, as a result of the hypnosis, Shingleton's &quot;description matches the one given by [the] victim.&quot; <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">2&nbsp;Shingleton, however, stated during deposition testimony that he could not observe whether the suspect's eyes were glassy or clear. Further, one of the investigating officers stated that &quot;both [witnesses] saw the man under conditions of extremely reduced light or extremely poor light, one being a color variation [Shingleton], the other being slight lighting [Wilson]. And the two tried to adjust what they saw based on what they believed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">3&nbsp;Shingleton could not recall whether or not he had seen the composite drawing created from Ms. Wilson's description prior to the hypnosis. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 26, 1982, two police officers spotted Jean at a Dunkin' Donuts restaurant, located near the victim's home. Believing that Jean matched the description of Wilson's assailant, the two officials detained Jean and radioed for Shingleton to come view him. Shingleton arrived, and positively identified Jean as the person he had stopped, stating, &quot;that is the man.&quot; Jean was then taken into custody, photographed, fingerprinted and his marine locker searched -- all acts which Jean consented to. The search of Jean's locker uncovered a blue tee shirt, a blue pair of shorts with a white border and white stripes on each side, and a pair of white high-top basketball sneakers, with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name and logo inscribed in black, and black laces in the sneakers. Shortly thereafter, Jean was released. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, July 27, 1982, Ms. Wilson viewed a photo line-up, which included Jean's picture. She could not identify any of the subjects as her rapist. Ms. Wilson, however, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  returned to the police station the next day because one of the pictures made her &quot;feel sick.&quot; She again viewed the photos and selected Jean's photo, saying that his was the face that made her feel sick. She also selected another photo, saying that the person in that photo looked &quot;haunty.&quot; Wilson could not, however, make a positive identification of Jean as her assailant. During that same meeting, police showed Ms. Wilson the clothes that had been removed from Jean's locker, but she apparently did not recognize them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">4&nbsp;The investigating officer stated that had Wilson recognized the clothing, he would have indicated it in his report, which he did not. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 30, 1982, Captain Collins hypnotized Ms. Wilson to &quot;improve her memory of why [the] picture makes her sick.&quot; When Collins asked her if she had ever seen the person in the photo that made her ill, she replied that she did not know. He then asked if the picture and the rapist &quot;looked the same? especially the eyes?, shape of face?&quot; She replied &quot;yes.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Again, Collins&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  audio taped only the actual hypnosis, though this time he filled out a &quot;Pre-Hypnosis Information Worksheet,&quot; briefly listing the characteristics of the assailant that the victim was able to describe at that time. After the hypnotic session, Collins filled out a &quot;During Hypnosis Information Worksheet,&quot; circling the items of &quot;new information&quot; as (1) a description of the assailant's eyes as grey, (2) possible Puerto Rican accent, (3) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emblem on his shoes, and (4) white shoelaces. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">5&nbsp;The parties dispute whether Wilson positively identified Jean's picture as her attacker during the hypnosis. The colloquy between Collins and Wilson went as follows: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Collins: Now Kathy, you're going to go back to this photograph now. Let your mind travel back very easily and slowly to the photograph that you described earlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">The one photograph that causes you to be ill and I'm going to ask you to be very honest with me, you're safe and secure now. Have you ever seen the eyes in that photograph before? [Long pause] You're safe and secure Kathy. As a matter of fact I'm going to go even further now. You're safer than you've ever been. No harm can possibly ever come to you again. You're with friends. Now I want you to tell me -- the face of the man in your bedroom [door slam] [is (?)] the same as the photograph that you are now looking at in your mind's eye, of the photograph that you saw when shown to you by Detective Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, was it the same face? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Wilson: [Wouldn't be surprised./Wouldn't be so &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. (?)] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Collins: Do the pictures appear to be the same? Especially the eyes? The shape of the face? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Wilson: Yes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Collins: Do you believe that the photograph and the man in your bedroom were one and the same? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Be very honest with us. No body's [sic] going to hurt you any further. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c35"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Wilson: [They look the same (?)]</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c17">The question marks indicate where Wilson's answers cannot be discerned because of the very poor quality of the audiotape. However, the tape suggests that Ms. Wilson more strongly associated Jean as her rapist during the hypnosis than she had done at any time prior to hypnosis. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On August 3, 1982, the police made a voice exemplar tape, which included Jean's voice, along with four other voices -- two with a northern United States accent, one with a Guamanian accent and the final one with a Puerto Rican accent. Jean, who was born in Haiti and spent part of his life there, has a Creole accent, which is a mixture of French and African dialects. Wilson stated that Jean's voice and the Puerto Rican voice sounded similar to the voice of her assailant, but she could not make a positive identification. One week later, Wilson telephoned the police and, without having listened to the tapes again, purported to identify Jean's voice as that of her assailant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six weeks later, on September 17, 1982, the police had Wilson view a three man line-up, which consisted of Jean and two other black men. One of the men was taller, the other shorter, than Jean. Neither possessed a military haircut and defendant's face is the only one which appeared in each photo identification as well as the live line-up. After viewing the line-up, Wilson positively identified Jean as her attacker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1982, Jean was indicted on charges of rape and sexual assault. Counsel for defendant filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a timely motion for discovery, which included the following request: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">To disclose the facts and circumstances surrounding any . . . pre-trial identification . . . at least sufficient to allow the defendant to determine whether to proceed under N.C.G.S. 15A-977 [governing motions to suppress evidence]. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">To permit the defendant to inspect and copy . . . mechanical or electronic recordings, tangible objects, or copies or portions thereof . . . which are material to the preparation of his defense . . . . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c17">To provide . . . results or reports of physical or mental examinations or of tests, measurements or experiments made in connection with the case . . . .</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this request, the state did not inform defense counsel that the victim may have identified Jean's photograph, that the two key witnesses had been hypnotized, or that various records pertaining to hypnosis and identification procedures existed. In fact, defense counsel did not learn of the hypnosis until after trial had already started, and after Ms. Wilson had already testified on direct examination. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After learning of the hypnosis, counsel requested any recordings that might exist -- inexplicably the state still did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provide its records or tapes. Though defense counsel cross-examined both Ms. Wilson and Officer Shingleton on the possible effects of the hypnosis, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he did not have the recordings to help contradict the witnesses' testimony or to demonstrate the pervasive procedural flaws in the hypnosis. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">6&nbsp;During the hearing on Jean's Motion for Appropriate Relief, Jean's trial counsel recounted how he learned of the hypnosis, stating: &quot;after [Ms. Wilson] testified on the merits, there was some discussion between ourselves and the Assistant District Attorney about a statement as well as the fact that she had been hypnotized; and that's when I first found out; the case had started.&quot; </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's evidence consisted of Jean's sneakers, shorts and tee shirt, a blood/semen test that placed him in the same 32% of the population as the rapist, and the identification testimony of Wilson and Shingleton, who both identified Jean at trial, though Shingleton acknowledged that he could not be absolutely certain. In his own defense, Jean offered &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  four alibi witnesses. Three marines testified that they awakened Jean in his bunk or saw him there at the time the victim was assaulted. The fourth witness, Jean's platoon commander, testified that Jean was required to be on duty at that time, and that if Jean had not been present there would have been a record of his absence, which there was not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, 1982, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all four counts. The trial court sentenced Jean to two consecutive life terms in prison and the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">State v. Jean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 310 N.C. 157, 311 S.E.2d 266 (1984). After exhausting his state appeals and being denied post-conviction relief, Jean filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Though the magistrate judge recommended that the writ should issue, the district court, conducting a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> review, denied the writ. It is that judgment we review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dangers inherent in hypnotically enhanced testimony have been widely recognized. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Rock v. Arkansas</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 483 U.S. 44, 59-60, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37, 107 S. Ct. 2704 (1987), the Supreme Court stated: <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c17">Three general characteristics&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c21">[**12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">  of hypnosis may lead to the introduction of inaccurate memories: the subject becomes &quot;suggestible&quot; and may try to please the hypnotist with answers the subject thinks will be met with approval; the subject is likely to &quot;confabulate,&quot; that is, to fill in details from the imagination in order to make an answer more coherent and complete; and, the subject experiences &quot;memory hardening,&quot; which gives him great confidence in both true and false memories, making effective cross-examination more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The Supreme Court added that these dangers can be &quot;reduced, although perhaps not eliminated, by the use of procedural safeguards.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 60. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">State v. Hurd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 86 N.J. 525, 432 A.2d 86 (1981),  [HN1] the New Jersey Supreme Court enumerated six procedural safeguards for hypnotic sessions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court stated that, first, the hypnotic session must be conducted by a psychiatrist or psychologist trained in the use of hypnosis. Second, the session must be independent of the police investigation, the prosecution and the defense. Third, the hypnotist's knowledge of the facts in the case should be recorded. Fourth, before hypnosis, the hypnotist should obtain a detailed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  description of the subject's current memory of the event. Fifth, the hypnosis session should be recorded -- video taping is strongly recommended -- so a permanent record exists to ensure against suggestive procedures. Finally, only the hypnotist and the subject should be present during any phase of the hypnotic session, including the prehypnotic &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testing and the posthypnotic interview.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Hurd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 432 A.2d at 96-97. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">7&nbsp;In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">State v. Peoples</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, 311 N.C. 515, 319 S.E.2d 177, 188 (1984), the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that hypnotically refreshed testimony is inadmissible in judicial proceedings.

Evidence is &quot;material&quot; when &quot;there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A 'reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">United States v. Bagley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 105 S. Ct. 3375 (1985). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean contends that the evidence concerning the hypnosis is material evidence under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. We agree. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the identifications, there was little independent corroborating evidence to sustain Jean's conviction: there were no fingerprints or matching pubic hairs; the blood/semen test only placed Jean in the same 32% as the rapist; and the voice exemplar was of dubious quality, had only one black voice on it, and presented difficulty to Ms. Wilson, causing her to take one week to make her identification. Consequently, Jean's conviction rests substantially on the witness identifications, which makes disclosure of the recordings all the more critical. Had defense counsel had the audio recording and accompanying reports, it could have used that evidence to discredit the testimony of Ms. Wilson and Officer Shingleton. Despite Ms. Wilson's contention that the hypnosis had no effect on her, the audio recording suggests that it may have been during hypnosis that Ms. Wilson first identified Jean as her assailant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similarly, we think the audio tapes and accompanying records were material as evidence having strong potential for impeaching Shingleton's testimony. The stripe on the tee shirt that Shingleton thought he saw became a sweatmark under hypnosis. The mustache disappeared entirely. Under hypnosis, Shingleton recalled white shoelaces, but Jean's were black; he recalled striped socks, but Jean's were not; he recalled shorts with no stripes, but Jean's shorts had stripes and white trim; and he recalled glassy eyes, but in deposition testimony stated that he could not see the suspect's eyes clearly. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">9&nbsp;Impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence, of course, falls within the principles of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Brady. See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Giglio v. United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">10&nbsp;The district court found that Ms. Wilson's illness at the sight of Jean's photograph was a &quot;form of association that verges on an identification.&quot; We disagree. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are persuaded that the audio recordings and accompanying reports -- twice&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requested -- should have been disclosed to defense counsel, and that the government's failure to do so was a violation of the principles announced in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its progeny. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"><SUP>11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to issue the writ of habeas corpus. Unless the state elects to retry the defendant within a reasonable time, he should be released. <BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c17">11&nbsp;Because we reverse under the due process principles enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">, we need not consider Jean's contention that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c23">use</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> of hypnotically refreshed testimony also violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admission to advertising's biggest, and diciest, extravaganza, the&nbsp;Super Bowl, may have tripled in the past decade - from $ 275,000 to&nbsp;$ 800,000 for 30 seconds' worth of 100 million Americans' attention - but&nbsp;sponsors are still rushing to the game, checkbooks in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're actually in pretty good shape,&quot; says Jake Keever, by way of&nbsp;understatement. Mr. Keever is executive vice president of sales at ABC,&nbsp;which is broadcasting the game Jan. 27. &quot;We have two spots unsold on the&nbsp;game, and four people are chasing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC will fetch $ 45 million from the 56 30-second spots during the&nbsp;game, and another $ 9 million from the 2 1/2 hours of pregame and postgame&nbsp;shows, which the network is selling for prices ranging from $ 110,000 to&nbsp;$ 450,000 for 30 seconds. All but four of these spots are sold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game was such a blowout last year (the San Francisco 49ers&nbsp;drubbed the Denver Broncos 55-10), viewers tuned out the second half and&nbsp;the game received the lowest rating in two decades. That's had a chilling&nbsp;effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our clients are going into the NFL playoffs, it's safer,&quot; says&nbsp;Larry Kapold, an executive vice president with Foote Cone &amp; Belding,&nbsp;whose clients include previous Super Bowl advertisers Mazda Motors of&nbsp;America and Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for many advertisers - such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola - a&nbsp;chance to skewer a competitor or introduce a new product in front of the&nbsp;year's largest TV audience is a chance they can't afford to miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among this year's biggest Bowlers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola and Walt Disney World. They're co-sponsoring a 12-minute&nbsp;halftime show featuring New Kids on the Block. At the beginning of half,&nbsp;Atlanta-based Coca-Cola will air a special &quot;Crack the Code for Real&nbsp;Refreshment&quot; ad, enabling game-card holders (the company hopes to&nbsp;distribute 75 million cards before the game) to hold their cards up to&nbsp;the screen and become instant winners. The commercial emits a special&nbsp;signal that &quot;decodes&quot; the cards. Prizes range from coupons for Diet Coke&nbsp;to a single cash prize of $ 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi-Cola, not to be outdone, says it will make millionaires of&nbsp;three viewers on game day through its Diet Pepsi &quot;You've Got the Right&nbsp;One Baby, Uh-Huh!&quot; call-in promotion. Viewers get game instructions in&nbsp;commercials aired before and during the game, then call a toll-free&nbsp;number. A recorded message by singer Ray Charles, who appears in the&nbsp;commercials, asks callers to sing the new Diet Pepsi theme song, and&nbsp;leave their name and address. Finalists will be chosen randomly, and the&nbsp;three $ 1 million winners will be announced in a post-game commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletic shoe rivals </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and L.A. Gear will go toe to toe. L.A.&nbsp;Gear hired the same creative team - now at a different agency - that&nbsp;created the famous &quot;1984&quot; Super Bowl spot for Apple Macintosh computers&nbsp;to create an ad to launch its new Catapult shoe. And the agency that&nbsp;created the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads is producing the kickoff campaign for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air 180.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anheuser-Busch is taking its Bud Bowl into the third year, spending&nbsp;$ 6 million to air its farcical football games between bottles of beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panasonic is spending $ 4 million on six commercials to promote its&nbsp;corporate image and new products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other advertisers slated to appear on the game include McDonald's,&nbsp;AT&amp;T, Federal Express, United Parcel Service, and Master Lock Co.; Safe harbor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real estate is hardly recession-proof. The Fed's $ 2.3 billion&nbsp;bailout of The Bank of New England this week (largely because of bad real&nbsp;estate loans) is evidence enough of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in the throes of a recession, Atlanta's Austin Kelley&nbsp;Advertising this week began a print campaign in Florida newsppaers&nbsp;promoting Arvida Communities in Florida as a safe investment in a&nbsp;recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ad urges investors who are &quot;looking for signs of stability in&nbsp;the economy&quot; to look no further than Arvida. Another reads, &quot;When the&nbsp;future looks a little uncertain, it's time to review the lessons of the&nbsp;past.&quot; The ads explain that Arvida properties have &quot;weathered economic&nbsp;storms for 30 years . . . and have remained both a solid value and South&nbsp;Florida's most beautiful way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents revealing how much Vince Dooley made as football coach and&nbsp;athletics director at Georgia in 1986 reveal how a coach's outside income&nbsp;can dwarf his salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the $ 374,497.89 Dooley received that year, only $ 125,500 came&nbsp;from Georgia. The remaining $ 248,997.89 came from a shoe company, radio&nbsp;and television contracts, speaking engagements, and a football camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated attempts to contact Dooley by telephone were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to documents obtained by The Journal-Constitution under an&nbsp;order by the Georgia Supreme Court, Dooley's salary for the year was&nbsp;$ 95,000. In addition, he received $ 4,500 in expenses, plus a $ 26,000&nbsp;premium paid on an annuity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also had use of a luxury automobile and housing. The house in&nbsp;which Dooley resides was deeded to him by Georgia's athletics association&nbsp;several years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents show that Dooley received $ 152,341.77 for his weekly&nbsp;television shows during the 1986 football season, plus another $ 30,000&nbsp;for appearing on Georgia's football radio network shows, another $ 9,000&nbsp;for 11 tailgate shows and $ 6,000 for a weekly call-in show on WGST-AM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the documents show Dooley received $ 30,000 from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;shoe contract (not including $ 2,000 worth of merchandise, 300 pairs of&nbsp;shoes for his team, plus another 100 because the Bulldogs went to a bowl&nbsp;game, and $ 500 in merchandise for each of 12 assistants).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley resigned as head coach effective at the conclusion of&nbsp;Georgia's Gator Bowl victory over Michigan State on Jan. 1, 1989, but&nbsp;remains athletics director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents on Dooley's income originally were requested by The&nbsp;Journal-Constitution in 1987 under the state open records act. University&nbsp;president Charles Knapp agreed to release them, but Dooley, men's&nbsp;basketball coach Hugh Durham and women's basketball coach Andy Landers&nbsp;filed suit in Fulton County Superior Court in December 1987 to prevent&nbsp;release of the records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Nov. 29 last year that all but two&nbsp;of the documents in question were public domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another hearing is scheduled for Fulton County Superior Court Jan.&nbsp;28 before Judge Frank Hull in which requests for other Georgia documents&nbsp;plus similar files detailing athletic-related outside income of Georgia&nbsp;Tech coaches will be argued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince Dooley says his athletically related income - documented&nbsp;earlier this week at more than $ 374,000 in 1986 - explains why his wife&nbsp;didn't want him to quit coaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's exactly the reason Barbara didn't want me to give up&nbsp;coaching after 25 years,&quot; Dooley said. &quot;When we got to Georgia, my salary&nbsp;was $ 12,500. I got a $ 2,000 subsistence allowance and a $ 1,000 television&nbsp;package - $ 100 per game - for a grand total of $ 15,500. That's probably&nbsp;about what I was worth then.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I finally reached a respectable salary in light of the job I was&nbsp;doing,&quot; Dooley said, &quot;and Barbara didn't want me to give up the greatest&nbsp;portion of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dooley retired as head coach after the 1988 season, but stayed on as&nbsp;athletics director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents made public by order of the Georgia Supreme Court indicate&nbsp;Dooley made $ 197,342 from radio and TV shows in 1986, $ 30,000 from a shoe&nbsp;contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $ 5,250 from his summer football camp and $ 2,406 for a&nbsp;cap endorsement - a total of $ 234,998, which he no longer receives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROCKET MAN: Notre Dame football player Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail, who&nbsp;announced Thursday he will forgo his senior season in favor of the NFL,&nbsp;will be transformed into a corporation - &quot;Team Rocket&quot; - that is expected&nbsp;to convert his clean image into millions of dollars. Ismail already has&nbsp;assembled a team of negotiators, financial advisors and attorneys. It's&nbsp;been estimated he could gross $ 25 million almost immediately upon signing&nbsp;a pro football contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOING, GOING, GONE: The Atlanta Braves' &quot;Smiling Indian&quot; logo is&nbsp;quietly being phased out as an official symbol of the team. According to&nbsp;Steve Goff, merchandise manager of the Braves Clubhouse at CNN Center,&nbsp;the team will emphasize the tomahawk with either &quot;Atlanta&quot; or &quot;Braves&quot;&nbsp;written above it. However, in order to protect the trademark - and to&nbsp;satisfy some customers who specifically ask for the smiling Indian emblem&nbsp;on their merchandise - the Braves' catalog this year will feature one or&nbsp;two items with that logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUESTS OF HONOR: University of Georgia ticket manager Freddy Jones&nbsp;says the expansion of Sanford Stadium, raising capacity from 82,122 to&nbsp;86,357, will mean more end-zone seating for visiting fans and more&nbsp;sideline seating for Bulldogs fans. Construction in the lower level of&nbsp;the west end zone is under way and will be complete in time for the 1991&nbsp;season. Georgia has sold all of its 48,000 season tickets every year&nbsp;since 1980, but Jones doesn't expect to sell out this season - even with&nbsp;a home schedule that includes games against LSU, Clemson, Auburn and&nbsp;Kentucky - because of the addition of 4,235 extra seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RINGER: A Georgia Tech players committee appointed to decide on the&nbsp;design of the Yellow Jackets' football national championship rings heard&nbsp;presentations from three companies this week - Herff Jones, Jostens and&nbsp;Balfour. According to assistant athletics director Jim Murphy, NCAA rules&nbsp;allow schools to purchase championship awards for players as long as the&nbsp;price is under $ 300. . . . Along with hot dogs, popcorn, soft drinks, T-&nbsp;shirts, pom-pons and bumper stickers, Tech students can purchase an MCI&nbsp;long-distance telephone calling card in the concourse of Alexander&nbsp;Memorial Coliseum. Murphy explained MCI's presence was part of a&nbsp;contractual agreement between the company and the athletics association&nbsp;to provide access to students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEMINOLE PRICE UPRISING: Insisting that Florida State basketball&nbsp;&quot;has been underpriced,&quot; Seminoles athletics board member Fred Standley&nbsp;says ticket prices would increase 60 percent - from $ 95 per season ticket&nbsp;to $ 150 - when the school begins ACC competition next season. . . . Tampa&nbsp;will spend approximately $ 2 million on hosting the Super Bowl, but the&nbsp;economic impact to the city will be approximately $ 120 million in direct&nbsp;spending. . . . Taking a hint from the NCAA, Mississippi junior college&nbsp;presidents have decided to cut costs by reducing scholarship limits&nbsp;across the board. The ceiling on football scholarships will drop from 30&nbsp;to 28 beginning next season.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's &quot;Pump Up and Air Out&quot; ad campaign, launched during the&nbsp;Super Bowl and featuring Atlanta Hawks forward Dominique Wilkins, will&nbsp;cost the company $ 20 million during its three-month run - the shoe&nbsp;manufacturer's most expensive promotional blitz ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various ads also will feature Dennis Rodman of the Detroit Pistons,&nbsp;Boomer Esiason of the Cincinnati Bengals, golfer Greg Norman, tennis&nbsp;player Michael Chang and decathlete Dave Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reebok's &quot;Pump&quot; device is now standard equipment in 36 models of&nbsp;shoes, and &quot;Air Out&quot; is a none-too-subtle snipe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan&nbsp;line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if $ 20 million seems like a lot to spend to promote an&nbsp;inflatable shoe, consider Pump sales already are well over $ 200 million&nbsp;since the shoe was introduced in November 1989.

The company&nbsp;is donating 50 cents to the American Red Cross for every seat sold. ...&nbsp;The University of Florida Athletic Association has contributed $ 600,000&nbsp;to the university's emergency fund, which was established to counter&nbsp;state-mandated budget reductions.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NON-SIGNS OF THE TIMES: Drag racer Shirley Muldowney, citing the&nbsp;poor state of the nation's economy, is down to only one sponsor - herself&nbsp;- and wonders if she will make it through the 18-event NHRA season. The&nbsp;one-season price-tag to race: $ 1 million. ... New water fountains in&nbsp;addition to the eight already in place at Legion Field - all located at&nbsp;the south end of the stadium - aren't a part of renovations scheduled to&nbsp;be completed in time for the 1991 football season, forcing thirsty fans&nbsp;to buy soft drinks at $ 1.25 each...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed sale of the Montreal Expos for $ 86 million has been&nbsp;delayed because of questions some major league owners have about changes&nbsp;in the diverse financial partnership, which ranges from a credit union to&nbsp;a food company to the city of Montreal. The sale must be approved by 75&nbsp;percent of National League owners and 50 percent of American League&nbsp;owners. . . . According to the National Sporting Goods Association, the&nbsp;average annual revenue from table time at a pool hall is $ 107,482, and&nbsp;the average cost of a stationary bicycle rose from $ 120.94 in 1985 to&nbsp;$ 192.69 in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIDDING WAR: Memphis has declared war on Jackson, Miss., by offering&nbsp;$ 1 million to lure the Arkansas-Ole Miss football game from Memorial&nbsp;Stadium to the Liberty Bowl. The game, held in Jackson in odd-numbered&nbsp;years since 1981, has played before shrinking audiences in recent&nbsp;seasons. At $ 20 per ticket this fall, the city would have to sell 50,000&nbsp;tickets just to break even if it matches the Memphis offer. A crowd of&nbsp;only 42,000 watched the 1989 game in Jackson, which at $ 20 per ticket&nbsp;would have resulted in a $ 160,000 deficit for the city on a $ 1 million&nbsp;guarantee. &quot;We have made no decision yet on the site of the Arkansas&nbsp;game,&quot; Ole Miss athletics director Warner Alford said, &quot;but it's purely a&nbsp;budgetary matter with me. I've got to do whatever is in the best interest&nbsp;of the department.&quot; ... Wayne McDuffie, the University of Georgia's new&nbsp;offensive coordinator, hasn't signed a contract yet, but once the&nbsp;recruiting season is over he will sign a two-year deal calling for an&nbsp;$ 85,000 salary the first year, $ 90,000 the next, according to athletics di</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The Atlanta Braves rewarded National League&nbsp;rookie of the year David Justice with a $ 195,000 raise Wednesday, signing&nbsp;the outfielder to a one-year contract worth $ 297,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice's deal is the biggest in major-league history for a player&nbsp;entering his second season, according to his agent, Eric Goldschmidt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most a player had gotten before, going into his second season,&nbsp;was Baltimore pitcher Gregg Olson,&quot; said Goldschmidt, a Los Angeles-&nbsp;based agent who also represents Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olson, who won the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1989,&nbsp;made $ 270,000 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice, who made $ 102,000 in 1990, hit .282 with 29 home runs and&nbsp;81 RBIs. H e blossomed after the trade of Dale Murphy, replacing him in&nbsp;right field and hitting 11 home runs during a 16-game span in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just goes along with everything else that is happening in&nbsp;baseball as far as the pay scale,&quot; said Braves general manager John&nbsp;Schuerholz. &quot;But I'm not saying David doesn't deserve it, because he had&nbsp;a great season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice also has become marketable off the field. His marketing&nbsp;agent, Mike DeSola of PrimeTime Sports Marketing in New York, said&nbsp;Justice has made $ 100,000 from endorsements and autograph shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the hottest sport commodity in Atlanta,&quot; said DeSola. &quot;He has&nbsp;a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes and Easton batting gloves, and by the time he&nbsp;goes to spring training, we will have worked a glove deal with either&nbsp;Rawlings or Regent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the signing of Justice, the Braves now have 11 players on their&nbsp;40-man roster not under contract: pitchers John Smoltz, Steve Avery, Tony&nbsp;Castillo, Kent Mercker and Paul Marak; catchers Greg Olson and Kelly&nbsp;Mann; infielders Jeff Blauser, Mark Lemke and Francisco Cabrera, and&nbsp;outfielder/first baseman Tommy Gregg</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoe in the roadway recently was grim evidence of a&nbsp;tragic accident that killed a mother, a Brookwood High School senior and&nbsp;a former student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen driving one of the vehicles, a late-model Pontiac&nbsp;Bonneville SSE, was speeding up to 70 mph on a residential street when he&nbsp;lost control and crashed head-on into the woman's van, police said. The&nbsp;mother was heading to Brookwood to pick up her daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What caused that wreck is what I refer to as the testosterone&nbsp;level. The driver apparently couldn't resist using the power of his&nbsp;vehicle,&quot; George W. Black Jr., Gwinnett's director of transportation,&nbsp;said later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Feb. 7 crash pushed the number of Brookwood classmates who have&nbsp;died in car wrecks in the last three years to 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, parents, teens and other members of the community were&nbsp;jolted into re-examining the problem of teen driving habits, something a&nbsp;community task force has been doing since September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force, composed of police, legislators, students, parents&nbsp;and teachers at Brookwood, has proposed more than 12 ideas for parents to&nbsp;help make their teens safer drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They concluded parents should not help teens buy fast cars, should&nbsp;boost teen awareness of driving safety and should not let teens drive&nbsp;after midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the task force is committed to stemming the tide of teen&nbsp;driving deaths, many students seem fatalistic and unconvinced safety&nbsp;measures can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what could stop the carnage, one Brookwood junior said&nbsp;too many teens are unsafe drivers but she didn't think anything could be&nbsp;done about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior noted all cars will go 70 mph or 80 mph - more than fast&nbsp;enough to kill someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another senior said his driver's education class didn't spend much&nbsp;time on safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But school officials said safety is definitely a large portion of&nbsp;the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a student interprets as not being safety really might be&nbsp;safety,&quot; said Dan Chelko, Brookwood's community school director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think it would help if teens were not allowed to drive high-&nbsp;performance cars?; Don't lay the blame on car</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think you can blame the car unless it's an equipment&nbsp;malfunction. I think the drivers, they err in their judgment, and that's&nbsp;what causes the collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I haven't seen a car yet that won't go fast enough to kill you. We&nbsp;have teenagers killed in VW Beetles and in Bonnevilles. The car doesn't&nbsp;have a whole lot to do with it. They're going to show off no matter what&nbsp;they are driving. Just like a buck deer when they're in rut, they'll kick&nbsp;up their heels, they'll drop their guard. That's how hunters manage to&nbsp;kill them. Same with a kid. They are not thinking, and that's what kills&nbsp;them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic division supervisor, Gwinnett police; Help teens resist pressure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. Such a prohibition should be part of a more comprehensive&nbsp;approach that includes helping teens and parents resist the social&nbsp;pressures that cause them to want such cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwinnett school superintendent; Kids shouldn't have cars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think they should because they don't use good judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I had a car when I was that age, I might not have been living&nbsp;today. Because I was wild too. And the best way to hold a kid back at&nbsp;that age until they mature more is to not allow them to have those cars,&nbsp;those machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former school board member; Driver's safety course first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they can afford to pay for them and pay for the insurance and the&nbsp;gas, yes, and after they have taken a driver's safety course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopkins Elementary School; Do what some colleges do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know. I think one way a solution could be reached would be&nbsp;the same way they do it in college. In the university system, students&nbsp;are not allowed to drive if they are freshmen. I feel like if a high&nbsp;school system would implement that, let them reach their junior and&nbsp;senior years, then they could drive any kind of vehicle as long as&nbsp;they've proved their responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwinnett commissioner; Leave it up to teens, parents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that should be a parental and teen decision, not a&nbsp;legislative decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think it would change the accident rate. Responsible driver&nbsp;education and more parental control over the car would reduce the&nbsp;accident rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a Mustang. My parents exercised extreme control. And I had no&nbsp;problem, no tickets, no accidents. Not only should teens be held&nbsp;responsible, parents should be responsible. And if they can't handle it,&nbsp;then teens should not be allowed to have the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president, Gwinnett Association of Educators; These autos made to speed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was one of the recommendations that we published that we&nbsp;discourage parents from helping young people buy high-performance cars.&nbsp;One of the reasons is there is a tendency with high-performance vehicles&nbsp;to drive fast because that is basically what the cars are made for, high&nbsp;speed. We are concerned in many instances that driver skills do not&nbsp;correspond with the power under the hood, that they can't control it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot of peer pressure. Parents, in order for their young&nbsp;persons to be popular, will just not use good common sense as far as&nbsp;parenting skills are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brookwood High School principal; Vehicles don't kill, drivers do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't have a problem about that. My husband does. We are a very&nbsp;divided household. It was funny you're asking because we were talking&nbsp;about it last night, my son and I on one side and my husband on the other&nbsp;side of the fence. Basically, I feel like the person should have respect&nbsp;for whatever vehicle they're driving, whether it's a bicycle or Trans Am.&nbsp;You have to know your limitations and ability to control that vehicle. I&nbsp;don't see that the vehicle kills; it is the driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13th District director, Georgia PTA; They are too dangerous'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. I feel they are too dangerous. I feel they are inexperienced to&nbsp;drive something that is high performance. I don't think they are&nbsp;responsible to be under control in all situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peachtree Elementary and Norcross High parent; At this age, there's no fear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't believe that they should be. At this age they have no fear.&nbsp;I just don't think they are mature enough to handle a high-performance&nbsp;car. The reason they have so many of these high-performance cars is peer&nbsp;pressure, and I feel like the parents are responsible for giving in and&nbsp;allowing these children to have these cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norcross High School parent; Bad for safety, insurance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think for their own safety it's not a good idea, especially&nbsp;beginning drivers because they need to get more experience in a less&nbsp;powerful car. I think for economic reasons it wouldn't be a wise decision&nbsp;for a teenager to own one of those cars because of the high insurance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAYTON, Ohio - Because of unwanted calls, Georgia Tech guard Kenny&nbsp;Anderson has changed his telephone number four times this season. Ohio&nbsp;State's Jim Jackson has gotten it every time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only time Anderson hopes Jackson won't have his number is today&nbsp;at the University of Dayton Arena, when the Yellow Jackets (17-12) meet&nbsp;the Buckeyes (26-3) in the second round of the NCAA Midwest Regional&nbsp;(Channel 5, 12:20 p.m.).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson makes sure Jackson, the Buckeyes' leading scorer, has his&nbsp;phone number because the two are good friends. Still, the Ohio State&nbsp;forward has a score to settle with him dating to their high school days,&nbsp;when Anderson was at Archbishop Molloy in New York and Jackson was at&nbsp;Macomber in Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their paths crossed at a tournament in Myrtle Beach, S.C., during&nbsp;their junior years. Anderson's team won by 20, though neither says he can&nbsp;remember the exact score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We met at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invitational camp at Princeton and I wanted to&nbsp;meet him because we came out rated the No. 1 and No. 2 players at the&nbsp;camp ,&quot; said Jackson, the No. 2. &quot;We found out we were going to play at&nbsp;Myrtle Beach. They beat us by 20, but the friendship continued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in full force Saturday, when they twice interrupted&nbsp;interviews with hordes of reporters to trade handshakes and their Dayton&nbsp;hotel phone numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't get into all that game stuff for Sunday, like I'm going&nbsp;to beat you,' &quot; Anderson said. &quot;Well, during the course of the game, I'll&nbsp;let him know. But I never thought it would come to this. Once I looked at&nbsp;the bracket and saw we were in their regional, I figured we probably will&nbsp;wind up playing each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their versions of the last time they met differ slightly. Said&nbsp;Anderson, &quot;He had 40 points and 20 rebounds, I had 40 points and two&nbsp;assists. It was really an exciting game, just battling it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Jackson, &quot;I had 35 points, 20 rebounds and he had like 38. But&nbsp;this game Sunday is a little bit different. More's on the line right now.&nbsp;I want to win. If he scores 50 and we win, that's cool. If he scores 50&nbsp;and we lose, that's a different story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech's second-round game last year featured Anderson against another&nbsp;high-profile Jackson - Chris of LSU. As he did before that game, Anderson&nbsp;is shying away from the hype that today's contest will become a one-on-&nbsp;one affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be Georgia Tech vs. Ohio State and I'm going to be&nbsp;ready for the challenge,&quot; Anderson said.</SPAN></P>

But&nbsp;now the conventional wisdom has apparently caught up with Bo Jackson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an announcement as sudden and stunning as one of his mammoth home&nbsp;runs or 90-yard touchdowns, the Kansas City Royals baseball team said it&nbsp;was releasing Jackson because of a devastating hip injury he suffered&nbsp;playing football. His career with the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders may also&nbsp;be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson vows to come back, and perhaps he will be able to do the&nbsp;unexpected again. But the man whose seemingly invincible athletic prowess&nbsp;was summed up by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TV commercial's phrase &quot;Bo knows&quot; now seems&nbsp;destined to be another of those American stars whose careers, like&nbsp;comets, blaze brightly before dying out all too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo Jackson had a $ 2,375,000 salary with the Royals. Because of his&nbsp;injury, the club is offering him to any team for $ 1. Young hero&nbsp;worshippers dreaming of sports glory should note the difference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo Jackson has moved into the category of damaged goods, and his hip&nbsp;injury could cost the football/baseball all-star $ 100 million or more in&nbsp;long-term salary and endorsement revenue if he is unable to continue his&nbsp;professional career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the opinion of Bob Hope, a former Atlanta Braves executive&nbsp;who now is executive vice president of the Burson-Marsteller public&nbsp;relations firm in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's biggest loss of income would be from his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe/apparel&nbsp;contract, currently estimated at $ 2.8 million per year. His total&nbsp;endorsement income this year is estimated at $ 4 million. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said it&nbsp;would not cancel its current contract with Jackson, but the company can&nbsp;drop him when the deal expires after 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was waived by the Kansas City Royals, Jackson will draw&nbsp;only one-sixth of his $ 2.375 million salary this year, but he will get&nbsp;his full $ 1.6 million salary from the L.A. Raiders since NFL teams are&nbsp;prohibited from waiving players hurt while playing football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were Jackson, 28, able to play 10 more seasons, his income likely&nbsp;would have totaled more than $ 100 million, according to Hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Jackson is able to play baseball later this season, watch&nbsp;for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back off gradually and introduce a replacement, such as&nbsp;former Notre Dame wide receiver Rocket Ismail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEMPHIS MONEY: Just because Federal Express owner Fred Smith has&nbsp;withdrawn from the ownership picture in the Memphis bid for an NFL&nbsp;franchise doesn't mean the city has abandoned its effort. Smith, alarmed&nbsp;that no one had taken the lead in generating community support necessary&nbsp;for a city to land a franchise, decided to do it himself. That leaves two&nbsp;promising ownership candidates: Billy Donovant, owner of a cotton&nbsp;brokerage firm that does $ 1.2 billion of business annually, and Wall&nbsp;Street commodities broker Paul Tudor Jones, famous for making $ 37 million&nbsp;in one day after the 1989 stock market crash. . . . Preliminary results&nbsp;of an NFL study under way by economists at the University of South&nbsp;Florida indicate that the Super Bowl's economic impact to Tampa was&nbsp;between $ 50 millionand $ 65 million, a long way from the $ 125 million&nbsp;advance estimate. War in the Persian Gulf, economic recession and a one-&nbsp;week period between the conference championships and the Super Bowl were t</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEAD OF THE CLASS: As an assignment for a sports administration&nbsp;course he teaches at the University of California, Andy Dolich -&nbsp;executive vice president of the Oakland A's - had six groups of students&nbsp;make presentations on the six cities aspiring for a major league baseball&nbsp;franchise. The class then voted on the city it thought should get the&nbsp;first team. The winner was Miami. . . . Two sellout games between the&nbsp;Yankees and Orioles at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium on Easter/Passover&nbsp;weekend - one of the toughest draw potentials of the year - show Miami's&nbsp;interest in a baseball franchise. . . . According to U.S. Olympic&nbsp;Committee executive director Harvey Schiller, the 22 companies that have&nbsp;put up nearly $ 22 million to be designated official USOC licensees&nbsp;through 1992 in support of the U.S. teams in Barcelona will generate some&nbsp;$ 400 million in retail sales.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all the guys that are truck drivers and construction&nbsp;workers all love the Rebels,&quot; he said. &quot;Beer drinkers are Rebel fans. If&nbsp;you go in the inner city, I think they're Rebel fans. It just depends. I&nbsp;think probably if you went into Beverly Hills, they're UCLA fans. South&nbsp;Dallas is pulling for the Rebels. So is the inner city of Detroit,&nbsp;Pasadena and the westside of Vegas.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHNSON MOST OUTSTANDING: UNLV forward Larry Johnson was named Most&nbsp;Outstanding Player of the West regional and was joined on the All-&nbsp;Tournament team by teammates Stacey Augmon and guard Greg Anthony and&nbsp;Seton Hall guard Terry Dehere and Arizona center Brian Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST VS. WEST: The ongoing feud between Tarkanian and Arizona's Lute&nbsp;Olson, which can be traced back to Olson's recruiting of Tom Tolbert out&nbsp;of Cerritos College, apparently has influenced players on both teams.&nbsp;After the Rebels won the subregional in Tucson, the players left an&nbsp;autographed basketball - &quot;UNLV No. 1&quot; - in the Wildcats locker room. &quot;It&nbsp;took a lot of gall for them to do that,&quot; said Arizona forward Brian&nbsp;Williams, adding that the Wildcats brought the ball with them to Seattle&nbsp;for motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, so much for motivation. The Wildcats were run off by Seton&nbsp;Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE DOME: Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo is moving slowly&nbsp;these days. He reportedly tore cartilage in his knee while jumping up and&nbsp;down at the Big East tournament and will require arthroscopic surgery . .&nbsp;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive Sonny Vaccaro - a close friend of both Tarkanian and&nbsp;Carlesimo - refuses to say with whom he's siding. But Vaccaro was less&nbsp;reluctant to take a shot at the NCAA, which, he says, complains about the&nbsp;company's sneaker deals with coaches but has never initiated a&nbsp;conversation. &quot;If it bothers them that all that money goes to coaches,&nbsp;and they're so concerned with academics, why don't they come up with a&nbsp;proposal where 25 percent or so goes directly to tutorial programs for&nbsp;the players?&quot; Vaccaro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZY BOYS? Utah coach Rick Majerus remained in Seattle to watch the&nbsp;UNLV-Seton Hall matchup and enjoy the &quot;big time&quot; for a few days. Among&nbsp;other things, Majerus proclaimed the chairs used for the interview&nbsp;sessions were of higher quality than those at the subregional in Tucson.&nbsp;&quot;We were sitting on folding chairs in Arizona,&quot; he said. &quot;What do they&nbsp;get at the Final Four, Lazy Boy recliners?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Salzman, a former newspaperman, TV producer and college&nbsp;journalism instructor, is a freelance writer living in Augusta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I DON'T THINK FILMMAKERS CAN INFLUENCE or affect anything. . . .&nbsp;Sometimes we can make a ripple, but, I mean, we're just a teaspoon in the&nbsp;ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a quote from Barry Levinson, the director of &quot;And Justice For&nbsp;All,&quot; &quot;Rain Man,&quot; and &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam,&quot; uttered in the midst of&nbsp;last fall's promotional campaign for his newest film, &quot;Avalon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quote disturbs. It's a circle-the-wagon response to what should&nbsp;be a wide-open examination of how media affect the real world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's akin to saying that &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; had nothing to do with&nbsp;the Civil War or that William Randolph Hearst's reward of $ 50,000 to&nbsp;anyone proving the Spanish blew up the USS Maine wasn't a cause of the&nbsp;Spanish-American War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers simply cannot help but be &quot;rippled&quot; by the emotional, gut-&nbsp;wrenching influence of huge moving color images backed by Dolby stereo&nbsp;sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The riots accompanying &quot;New Jack City&quot; this year, or &quot;The Warriors&quot;&nbsp;five years ago, or even John Hinckley's rationale for shooting former&nbsp;President Reagan are the most disturbing examples.; Teaspoons' sell products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are, of course, dismissible as the actions of the maladjusted&nbsp;and the mentally ill - not mainstream America. But mainstream America is&nbsp;influenced, as well, by what we see - witness the thousands of young men&nbsp;and women who flocked to Navy recruiting stations after viewing &quot;Top&nbsp;Gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Film's influence is most easily verified today by the fact that a&nbsp;Hollywood company exists to analyze scripts scene-by-scene to determine&nbsp;where and how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budweiser, Toyota, Pepsi and Kellog's products can&nbsp;best be plugged into feature films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Mr. Levinson truly believe these films and the other&nbsp;multinationals purchasing American Film Promotion's services are throwing&nbsp;massive dollars after &quot;teaspoons?&quot;; Images shape opinions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the director means that the films we see rarely destroy&nbsp;basic opinions or terminate lifelong value systems. In most cases, that's&nbsp;probably true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the attempt is made to alter public opinion, filmmakers can&nbsp;be amazingly effective. If not, why did American audiences find&nbsp;themselves cheering German sailors in the subtitled version of &quot;Das&nbsp;Boot,&quot; or the Viet Cong in 1989's &quot;Iron Triangle?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visual imagery can be brilliantly effective in reinforcing&nbsp;established ideas or in shaping opinions where none exists, often with&nbsp;unintended consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shot after shot of missing children at the close of the television&nbsp;movie &quot;Adam,&quot; for example, sent the nation into mass hysteria a few years&nbsp;ago, replete with milk cartons, missing posters, child finger-printings&nbsp;and &quot;don't ever talk to anyone&quot; lectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents all, very rationally, wanted to make certain their children&nbsp;were not among the 50,000 the movie told us disappeared every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reactions were logical responses to an intensely emotional film.&nbsp;Even after the news media discovered that 48,500 of those kids were&nbsp;either proven runaways or were taken by the other parent in a divorce,&nbsp;the hysteria continues with milk cartons and ad fliers.; Living on the mean streets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Movies and television programs like this give us what one critic&nbsp;calls the &quot;Mean World Syndrome.&quot; We are so sure that everyone out there&nbsp;is trying to rape, kill, hurt, con and rob us that we draw ourselves into&nbsp;individual cocoons, afraid of life. We buy extra locks, bulletproof book&nbsp;bags for our children, alarm systems for our boats, Mace packages for our&nbsp;cars, and guns, guns and more guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the Mean World Syndrome becomes the ultimate - and deadly -&nbsp;Catch 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps one or more of the police officers in Los Angeles with the&nbsp;all-too-ready nightsticks have what police call The Wyatt Earp Syndrome -&nbsp;a feeling that the cop's job is to save the world, even if it requires&nbsp;excessive violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Los Angeles cop, obviously, has met Wyatt Earp. But they have met&nbsp;his counterpart in countless Friday nights at the theater and Tuesday&nbsp;nights in their living room. People around &quot;Dirty Harry,&quot; remember, have&nbsp;a &quot;nasty habit of getting killed.&quot;; Power to influence values</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is just now beginning to grope with the issue of media&nbsp;influence. That's what the boycott of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot;&nbsp;the trials of 2 Live Crew and Judas Priest, the Parents' Music Resource&nbsp;Center and congressional mandates concerning commercial minutes on&nbsp;children's television are all about. It's why there has been such an&nbsp;uproar over Andrew Dice Clay and Public Enemy, over sex and violence,&nbsp;over blatant commercialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To state it bluntly: If Hollywood, if the networks, if the record&nbsp;companies won't acknowledge their power to shape values, then Americans&nbsp;are more than willing to take power from them, to alter or bypass the&nbsp;First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Constitution's decree that Congress shall make no&nbsp;law&quot; sounds absolute, the fact is that Congress, legislatures and the&nbsp;courts have routinely qualified freedom of speech. Examples abound from&nbsp;copyright and libel to recent obscenity rulings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, when anti-media public opinion is at a fever pitch, society&nbsp;appears poised to attack again. To prevent it, the film industry and the&nbsp;media in general must quit pretending they create only teaspoons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of those teaspoons, society feels, like the 27 men who died&nbsp;playing Russian roulette after viewing &quot;The Deer Hunter,&quot; are ripples in&nbsp;a tidal wave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Gwinnett schools have decided not to wait until 1996 for the&nbsp;Olympics. Students are already experiencing the intense competition and&nbsp;international flavor of the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional springtime field day activities have been expanded into&nbsp;weeks of researching the customs and culture of foreign countries.&nbsp;Classes then compete as particular nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the kids didn't know about other countries until they did&nbsp;this,&quot; said Marcia Nolan, a physical education teacher at Lilburn Middle&nbsp;School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school's Olympic Games included South Korea, Canada, Norway,&nbsp;Mexico and Italy. Students from the sixth through eighth grades were&nbsp;brought together to make up a country. &quot;We tried to pull the school&nbsp;together,&quot; Ms. Nolan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the athletic events - such as the 440-yard relay, an obstacle&nbsp;course and a tug of war - the students made their countries' flags and&nbsp;some even painted their faces and arms with the colors of their&nbsp;countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really feels like you're in the Olympics,&quot; said 12-year-old Nhan&nbsp;Huynh, a Lilburn Middle student.&quot;You learn good sportsmanship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the concept of holding a school Olympics is not new, the fact&nbsp;that the Games will be coming to Atlanta in five years has added fuel to&nbsp;the Olympic fire and given teachers a new method of building student&nbsp;enthusiasm about history, geography, politics and even physical&nbsp;education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a schoolwide Olympics is one example of how the county is&nbsp;moving toward an &quot;interdisciplinary curriculum,&quot; said Glen Blankenship,&nbsp;social studies coordinator for Gwinnett public schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anything we can do that makes students see how subjects are related&nbsp;makes learning that much more real and that much more effective,&quot; Dr.&nbsp;Blankenship said, adding that studying the Olympics &quot;gives students a&nbsp;better appreciation for other cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Racine, a seventh-grader at Lilburn Middle School, said he&nbsp;enjoyed learning about his team's country, South Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to do research on the conflicts and the wars they've had,&quot;&nbsp;Jesse said, adding that during the course of his study he also discovered&nbsp;that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes and a wide range of electronic devices are made in South&nbsp;Korea. &quot;I think it's a cool country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior Spain, a physical education teacher at Dacula Middle School,&nbsp;which held its first Olympics last year, said he felt his school helped&nbsp;bring the 1996 Games to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It made a good impression on the Olympic committee,&quot; Mr. Spain&nbsp;said. &quot;It gave us an idea that we were doing a little part in being able&nbsp;to sway the committee to pick Atlanta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) is hoping to get&nbsp;students excited about the Olympics &quot;so they can be good hosts when our&nbsp;guests come in 1996,&quot; said Sandy Jernigan, co-coordinator of the Olympic&nbsp;Day in the School program, which is primarily geared toward middle&nbsp;schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hundred of the 600 middle schools in Georgia now participate in&nbsp;the program, including all of Gwinnett's middle schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A program for the state's elementary and high schools will be&nbsp;developed over the next few years, Ms. Jernigan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buford Elementary, however, already has the Olympic vision. Their&nbsp;program began April 17 and ran for a month. Throughout the last four&nbsp;weeks, the pupils have studied their countries and competed in athletic&nbsp;events in their physical education classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Hanson, a physical education teacher, began holding an&nbsp;Olympics four years ago, but this was the first year the athletics&nbsp;competition was combined with the school's social studies fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project culminated last Friday with an international festival.&nbsp;With passports in hand, pupils traveled to different classrooms disguised&nbsp;as foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pupils' transworld experiences included mummifying a doll in&nbsp;Egypt, making maracas in Mexico, eating chocolate and cheese in&nbsp;Switzerland and playing golf in Puerto Rico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are all the same,&quot; first-grade teacher Gail Cary told a&nbsp;class of pupils dressed in authentic Saudi Arabian garb. Ms. Cary's&nbsp;country was Botswana. &quot;It's your culture that's different where you grow&nbsp;up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let curator Barbara Rowe clear this up:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have Michael's Olympic uniform and we borrowed his gold medal&nbsp;from his mother. And for a couple of years it was part of the Superstars&nbsp;of The Lower Cape Fear' exhibit. People loved it. We'll do it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You mean Michael shared the exhibit with former Harlem Globetrotter&nbsp;Meadowlark Lemon, Sammy Davis Sr. and country singer Charlie Daniels?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's an actor in Atlanta from here, not very big, I think&nbsp;he's in the Senate or something,&quot; Ms. Rowe says. &quot;Yeah, U.S. Rep.  Ben&nbsp;Jones. Cooter. We've got the jeans, cap and the sleeveless shirt he wore&nbsp;on The Dukes of Hazzard.' That's really neat. He came here and opened&nbsp;the exhibit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, well. There are still some in this quiet, coastal community of&nbsp;45,000 who say the Chicago Bulls superstar is their most favorite of&nbsp;sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if state and city fathers have yet to master the marketing&nbsp;acumen to make Michael Jordan as synonymous with Wilmington as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has&nbsp;done with him and their athletic shoes, one place remains as mythical as&nbsp;Michael Jordan's basketball talents - Laney High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namely, the scuffed hardwood in the crackerbox gymnasium, where a&nbsp;skinny teenager would practice alone at 7 a.m. before classes began. Then&nbsp;at night, he would dazzle the college scouts and basketball crazies,&nbsp;crammed to the rafters, with heretofore unseen acrobatics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every day, visitors ask to see the gymnasium. They glimpse&nbsp;Michael's gold and blue high school jersey in the glass case in the foyer&nbsp;- the familiar No. 23 emblazoned below BUCS, the team's nickname. They&nbsp;see his name engraved on a plaque honoring the Buccaneers' 1980-81&nbsp;championship team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if they're lucky enough to run into basketball coach Fred Lynch,&nbsp;they ask how was it Michael Jordan failed to make the varsity team as a&nbsp;10th-grader. How, Coach, did arguably today's greatest player - a member&nbsp;of the University of North Carolina's 1982 NCAA championship team, a 1984&nbsp;Olympic gold medal winner and the leader of a team seeking the 1991 NBA&nbsp;title - get cut?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lynch, then an assistant coach, has answered that question&nbsp;often. How there was only room for one 10th-grader on the varsity. How&nbsp;Leroy Smith, a 6-foot, 7-inch post player, was kept over a then 5-foot,&nbsp;10-inch Michael Jordan. How Michael never showed his disappointment at&nbsp;playing junior varsity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he was a 6-foot, 4-inch senior, he was All-Everything.&nbsp;Prep All-American in basketball. Top baseball pitcher. High jump&nbsp;champion. One of the nicest and most popular students ever at Laney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He showed that other people can make it if they try. That no one&nbsp;needs to act like they're special,&quot; says Jason Whitfield, graduating&nbsp;senior and basketball guard, who has heard this sports lore as gospel&nbsp;from his coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So until the North Carolina Board of Transportation mounts the first&nbsp;sign near the Cape Fear River (possibly this summer at a ceremony&nbsp;attended by Michael), or until the memorabilia of Sammy Sr., Meadowlark&nbsp;and Cooter are retrieved from mothballs, the most authentic tribute to a&nbsp;native son remains a small gymnasium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged rape at the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Fla., has&nbsp;caught the public's attention, and Time uses it as a hook in its June 3&nbsp;edition to examine the issue of date rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writer Nancy Gibbs points out that deciding exactly what is rape is&nbsp;hard to determine in a society where some colleges define acquaintance&nbsp;rape as a spectrum &quot;ranging from crimes legally defined as rape to verbal&nbsp;harassment and inappropriate innuendo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She notes that women call it a hidden crime, while some men blame it&nbsp;on women &quot;who live to tease.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-page report includes interviews with women and also with&nbsp;men who feel unjustly accused. And a poll of 500 U.S. adults taken by&nbsp;Time and CNN shows the differences on the issue. Among the results: 54&nbsp;percent of the women and 69 percent of the men say that some women like&nbsp;to be talked into having sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN AND MEDICINE I: Another sort of abuse of women is examined in&nbsp;the June issue of Ms. In &quot;Women as Wombs,&quot; Janice G. Raymond, professor&nbsp;of women's studies and medical ethics at the University of Massachusetts,&nbsp;questions the success of in vitro fertilization clinics. She says&nbsp;research has shown 90 percent to 95 percent of women who undergo IVF&nbsp;never take home babies. That finding is part of a wide-ranging report on&nbsp;the new reproductive technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN AND MEDICINE II: In the June 3 issue of People, actor Gene&nbsp;Wilder talks about wife Gilda Radner's losing battle with ovarian cancer&nbsp;and how doctors could have caught it sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACING UP TO PLASTIC SURGERY: Anyone considering a facelift or other&nbsp;plastic surgery may want to check out the June issue of Self. The piece,&nbsp;about top plastic surgeons, includes photos of a facelift in progress&nbsp;that are not for the squeamish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUYS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN: The June issue of GQ takes a look at a&nbsp;male institution in &quot;The Last Hurrah: Can the bachelor party survive&nbsp;feminism, premarital sex, AIDS and couch dancing? Should it?&quot; Writer&nbsp;Stephen Fried pulls together anecdotes of parties ranging from the tame&nbsp;to the raunchy. He also includes a rating scale to help guys determine&nbsp;how much trouble various last flings might cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPIKE UP TO BAT: The cover photo on the May 27 issue of Sports&nbsp;Illustrated has some heavy hitters - Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris&nbsp;smiling broadly for a piece on the 1961 Yankees - but the real slugger&nbsp;isn't even promoted. Inside is a 10-page interview with filmmaker Spike&nbsp;Lee on topics ranging from being a superfan to his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials to&nbsp;why he's such an angry young man. The search for what drives Mr. Lee goes&nbsp;back to his roots in Atlanta, Alabama and Brooklyn. Mr. Lee takes a jab&nbsp;at Deion Sanders, calling him &quot;another young brother who got some money&nbsp;and will have it spent before he knows he had it.&quot; The article is&nbsp;cleverly illustrated with photos of Mr. Lee in various baseball uniforms,&nbsp;including the Atlanta Braves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE SOUTH: The June issue of Atlanta magazine looks at the&nbsp;fall from grace of Emory University law school's Abe Ordover, who was&nbsp;accused of sexual misconduct. . . . The June issue of Southern Living&nbsp;offers a salute to national parks in the South as part of the National&nbsp;Park Service's 75th anniversary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cover charges at Atlanta-area sports bars for the Mike Tyson-Razor&nbsp;Ruddock heavyweight fight June 28 are likely to cost about $ 30 and would&nbsp;soar to between $ 40 and $ 45 for an Evander Holyfield-Tyson championship&nbsp;bout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the prediction of Atlanta attorney Bobby Ronick, who&nbsp;represents local pay-per-view TV marketing company Worldwide Satellites&nbsp;Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Covers at local sports bars for last month's Holyfield-George&nbsp;Foreman championship match ranged from $ 10 to $ 35, but the norm was $ 20.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most bars were at capacity, and that kind of demand will only push&nbsp;prices higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The in-home pay-per-view fees for Holyfield-Foreman ranged from a&nbsp;norm of $ 35.95 to $ 70, and those prices also are expected to be higher&nbsp;for Tyson-Ruddock or a Tyson-Holyfield matchup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOTTERY PLAN CUT: Faced with opposition from its senate's powerful&nbsp;majority leader, New York state has sacked a lottery proposal that would&nbsp;have been based on the NFL scores of Giants, Bills and Jets games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lottery would have operated much like many office football&nbsp;pools. Participants would have selected one of 100 squares that are&nbsp;randomly assigned two numbers from one to 10. Those whose two numbers&nbsp;matched the final digits of the score would win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NFL strongly opposes state lotteries linked to its games. The&nbsp;New York lottery was projected to raise $ 15 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HORSES LOSING GROUND: Horse racing, once the nation's most popular&nbsp;form of gambling entertainment, trailed lotteries in dollars wagered, $ 21&nbsp;billion to $ 11 billion, in 1990. . . . The NCAA has expanded its&nbsp;disability insurance plan to include baseball players in addition to&nbsp;football and basketball athletes. Players deemed likely to be taken in&nbsp;the first two rounds of the major league draft are eligible to purchase&nbsp;up to $ 900,000 in disability coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BYE-BYE, BO: With football/baseball star Bo Jackson sidelined at&nbsp;least temporarily with a hip injury, San Antonio Spurs center David&nbsp;Robinson may become a marketing superstar of similar magnitude. With a&nbsp;25.6 points-per-game average with the Spurs and a mathematics degree from&nbsp;the Naval Academy, Robinson remains a lieutenant and civil engineer in&nbsp;the Navy Reserve and is an accomplished pianist - in short, the clean-cut&nbsp;role model corporations are finding more and more difficult to locate.&nbsp;Robinson already is in the fourth year of a $ 1 million endorsement&nbsp;contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and signed deals with Casio watches and Franklin&nbsp;Sports Industries while serving a two-year stint in the Navy after&nbsp;graduation. However, experts predict it is unlikely Robinson will reach&nbsp;Jackson's estimated $ 5 million-per-year endorsement income. . . .&nbsp;Claiming patent infringement, Avia is suing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for unspecified damages&nbsp;in U.S. District Court in Portland, Ore. The suit claims </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is using a&nbsp;cushioning system in its new Air 180 series - which sell for&nbsp;approximately $ 125 per pair - that is similar to Avia's &quot;Cantilever&quot;&nbsp;technology, protected by three patents dating to 1980.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Action Awards Breakers have picked up where they left off last&nbsp;season. Hitting a robust .600, the Snellville-based men's softball team&nbsp;has qualified for one national, one divisional and three state&nbsp;tournaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last season's U.S. Slo-pitch Softball Association (USSSA) state&nbsp;Class C Team of the Year is 47-16 overall and is in the driver's seat to&nbsp;win the highly regarded Amateur Softball Association (ASA) state Bud&nbsp;Light Triple Crown series, which continues this weekend in Fort Valley,&nbsp;Ga. They won the first leg of the series three weeks ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series awards points based on a team's finish in three&nbsp;designated tournaments, with the points leader being declared the state&nbsp;champion. The champion also gets its room and board paid for in the&nbsp;national tournament later this summer in Steamboat Springs, Colo. The&nbsp;Breakers qualified for that tournament with the win three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a pretty prestigious thing there in Colorado,&quot; coach Ric&nbsp;Jarvis said. &quot;If we win the Triple Crown , we're probably talking a&nbsp;couple thousand dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Breakers' success in the ASA series is just part of the team's&nbsp;fast start. They've already earned berths for this summer's ASA, USSSA&nbsp;and National Softball Association (NSA) state tournaments, as well as for&nbsp;the USSSA Southeast Divisional. They've finished second in two highly&nbsp;competitive tournaments - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early Bird Tournament in Marietta and&nbsp;a USSSA divisional qualifier in Cartersville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been hitting the ball well, and our defense has been&nbsp;exceptional,&quot; said Jarvis, an original member of the team that was formed&nbsp;10 years ago to play in a recreation league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Breakers have done most of their damage by coming through the&nbsp;loser's bracket of recent tournaments. In the first Triple Crown event,&nbsp;for instance, they lost their opening game, then won the next nine to&nbsp;take the championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had to come back a number of times. That says a lot about our&nbsp;team right there,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;We've played in more games that a lot of&nbsp;other teams because we've had to come through the loser's bracket so many&nbsp;times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success is not new. Since becoming the Breakers in 1981, the&nbsp;team has gained statewide respect. Last year, four players - including&nbsp;Player of the Year Mike Jordan, Derrick Davis, Ron Ammnons and Roger&nbsp;Bailey - were named to the USSSA All-State team as the Breakers set a&nbsp;state record in Class C for points won in tournament play. By winning the&nbsp;state title, the Breakers moved up to play in USSSA's B classification&nbsp;this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're consistently one of the better teams in the state. People&nbsp;hate playing us,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;Through the years, we've really grown&nbsp;into a good team. It's been a longtime hobby for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other team members are Terry Gomez, Tim Fuller, Phil Taylor, Mark&nbsp;Williamson, Bo Davenport, Steve Harrison, Kevin Gaines, Tim Gaines, Sam&nbsp;Crowe, Greg Jones, Mike Lahey and Mark Azar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The golf-a-thon started at 8 a.m. Monday at Athens Country Club,&nbsp;which Durham and Goff played in one hour, 45 minutes, with each man&nbsp;riding his own cart. From there, after a 45-minute drive to Lake Oconee,&nbsp;they played the Harbor Club course in about two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lunch at nearby Port Armor, which they played in two hours and&nbsp;10 minutes, they drove a few miles down the road to Reynolds Plantation&nbsp;where, ironically, Georgia Tech's annual golf outing had just been&nbsp;completed. Playing their final course in just over two hours, Durham and&nbsp;Goff completed the 72 holes at 7:05 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither player wished to reveal the final scores, lest somebody&nbsp;remember them when filling out foursomes for all those handicap&nbsp;tournaments to which they regularly are invited, but Durham was the&nbsp;apparent winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We both played pretty good,&quot; said Goff, &quot;but I don't think I saw&nbsp;Hugh miss two or three fairways all day. I wouldn't have wanted to play&nbsp;him for money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you can believe it, though, Durham has spent busier days on a&nbsp;golf course. Last summer at singer Kenny Rogers's Beaver Dam Farms&nbsp;course, he played 100 holes in one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUST WONDERING: When was the last time in this town that there were&nbsp;more people talking about the Braves than there were people talking about&nbsp;the NBA Finals? . . . The NFL and the Atlanta Falcons will conduct a free&nbsp;clinic at 9 a.m. Friday at Morehouse College sponsored by Pro Set and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expected are 12 Falcons players, including safety Scott Case,&nbsp;linebacker Michael Reid and former return man Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot;&nbsp;Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON A MISSION: TNT sportscaster Ernie Johnson Jr. and wife Cheryl are&nbsp;in the process of adopting a Romanian child. Cheryl has been in Bucharest&nbsp;since May 16 with other hopeful parents from the Atlanta area and will&nbsp;bring home a 2 1/2-year-old boy who was abandoned at birth in a park and&nbsp;has lived in an orphanage with other undernourished children. &quot;It's been&nbsp;quite an experience,&quot; said Ernie, whose children, Eric 6, and Maggie, 4,&nbsp;are eager to meet their brother. Aurel Mihia Johnson and his new mother&nbsp;will be home as soon as they obtain a visa. &quot;We're going to call him&nbsp;Michael, which is what Mihia pretty much translates to,&quot; said Ernie, &quot;but&nbsp;if he's got a real good fastball, we might stick with Aurel.&quot; . . . Part-&nbsp;time Channel 46 sportscaster Phil Van Horn was the producer of the ESPN&nbsp;special that ran Wednesday on Georgia quarterback Eric Zeier, the former&nbsp;Marietta High star. What the show didn't detail was the fact that the&nbsp;biggest challenge for the massively recruited Zeier, who graduated from&nbsp;high school early and enrolled in time for the Bulldogs' spring&nbsp;practices, was juggling appointments with the &quot;escorts&quot; he encountered at&nbsp;various schools within the recruiting period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMEMBER, THE ICEBERG'S OUT OF BOUNDS: Talk about taking advantage&nbsp;of good lighting! They're holding the Cross Creek Arctic Open golf&nbsp;tournament in Iceland, just 31 miles south of the Arctic Circle, to take&nbsp;advantage of June 21, the shortest night of the year. There will be&nbsp;enough light available to play 36 holes at the Akureyri Golf Club. . . .&nbsp;The price of going to the ballpark is getting out of hand. According to a&nbsp;Team Marketing Report survey done for Major League Baseball, the average&nbsp;family of four will spend $ 76.22 while watching their team play a single&nbsp;baseball game. The figure covers the cost of four tickets, two beers,&nbsp;four hot dogs, four soft drinks, two baseball caps, two programs and&nbsp;parking. In some cities, don't forget the cost of paying a kid to watch&nbsp;your car so it's there when you return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INGLEWOOD, Calif. - L.A., a city of 3.5 million, is either too&nbsp;sophisticated or too vain to ever admit being in a state of shock. Siege,&nbsp;maybe. Not shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shock is empty freeways. Clipper victories. Surfboard shortages.&nbsp;Thirty consecutive days of cloud cover and no rain. And no sun, either.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what happened inside the fabled Forum on Wednesday was, at the&nbsp;very least, an aftershock. The Chicago Bulls won the title . . . The&nbsp;Chicago Bulls won the title . . . The Chicago Bulls won the title . . .&nbsp;The Chicago Bulls won the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four games. Four victories. Three wins in the Forum, and just like&nbsp;that - it was that easy - Michael Jordan no longer is the lonely Bull. No&nbsp;longer the lonely superstar. Now, he has plenty of friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bird. Magic. Isiah. With this ring, he becomes wedded to Magic&nbsp;Johnson and Larry Bird, who formed an elite club back in the 1980s. Non-&nbsp;champions need not apply. Isiah Thomas finally broke down the door.&nbsp;Pounded on it twice, in fact. Now, Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How good does it feel? Jordan cried. He was so overcome that he hid&nbsp;from NBC. &quot;Where's Jordan, where's Jordan?&quot; a frantic Bob Costas yelled,&nbsp;as he looked around the champagne-drenched locker room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others came and went. The Rev. Jesse Jackson. Spike Lee. Ernie&nbsp;Banks. Johnny Kerr. Lakers GM Jerry West and assistant GM Mitch Kupchak.&nbsp;&quot;Too crowded,&quot; West said, ending his search for Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, no Michael. But somewhere, by now, he was surely smiling. He&nbsp;had guided the Bulls to their first-ever championship in 25 years. A&nbsp;party in Chicago awaits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A.? L.A. can mourn, can shake, can complain that it wasn't fair&nbsp;because James Worthy and Byron Scott were hurt and Magic Johnson too old&nbsp;and Elden Campbell too young, but it was eminently fair, and right, and&nbsp;America celebrates because the Good Guy doesn't always finish last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time the Good Guy won. Jordan ate his Wheaties and did all the&nbsp;right things, and when the time came, he came through. Blocked shots,&nbsp;steals, jumpers, passes, breakaway dunks, scoop shots, Michael being&nbsp;Michael.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For six years, he wondered if it was meant to be. Six long years. As&nbsp;a rookie, he was snubbed in the All-Star Game by some of the (Isiah)&nbsp;Thomas Gang for arriving in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sweatsuit. His second year, he broke&nbsp;his foot and feuded with GM Jerry Krause because - get this - Jordan&nbsp;regained his health and wanted to finish out the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krause said no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan said yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess who won that battle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan would win others, as well, including a race for MVP honors&nbsp;with his good friend Johnson. But that was nothing. Nothing like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan and his teammates arrived at the Forum two hours before game&nbsp;time, eager to learn the condition of Worthy (ankle) and Scott&nbsp;(shoulder).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worthy arrived soon after in street clothes, and remained in street&nbsp;clothes. Scott changed into his jersey and went out to the court to test&nbsp;the shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the Laker faithful - and some non-partisans - suggested that&nbsp;L.A. had a better chance without Scott, who shot 27 percent in the first&nbsp;four games. Consider this exchange during the interview session on Monday&nbsp;at Inglewood High.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horde of media jackals: &quot;How is your shoulder?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott: &quot;Not good. I can't lift my arm. I can't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horde of media jackals: &quot;Ha, ha, ha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, as Vlade Divac might say, &quot;He make joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was no joke. Scott slowly walked off the court. No go. No&nbsp;Worthy. No Scott. No chance? The Bulls hoped not. During the two days&nbsp;between games, they were determined to retain their edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They resisted the lure of Hollywood, with Jordan even declining an&nbsp;invitation to appear on The Arsenio Hall Show, refused to become&nbsp;overconfident because of the injuries to Worthy and Scott, and the&nbsp;wounded ego of Magic, who dropped the Big One right here in the middle of&nbsp;the Forum on Tuesday. He might return for another season. He might not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan empathized, but refused to become distracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But would they win?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They win. When it is finally, mercifully over, Jordan bolts for his&nbsp;coach, Phil Jackson, and engages Paxson, the hero, in the longest of&nbsp;embraces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he enters the tunnel area, he is in tears. &quot;I've never been this&nbsp;emotional in public before,&quot; he says, &quot;but this is a great time to be&nbsp;emotional.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTLAND, Ore. - The Atlanta Falcons would still be in Suwanee&nbsp;tonight, not out west facing the Seattle Seahawks, if all of their&nbsp;expenses were not being picked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost for the Falcons' roundtrip charter alone, approximately&nbsp;$ 70,000, would make the cross-country trip prohibitive under any other&nbsp;circumstances. Falcons expenses have been budgeted at $ 90,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Portland State, the scrimmage's sponsor, hopes to net about&nbsp;$ 100,000 from an anticipated sellout crowd of 23,000 at Portland Civic&nbsp;Stadium. Ticket prices range from $ 7.50 to $ 25. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> located in nearby&nbsp;Beaverton, Ore., is helping pay some of the expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a school our size, the profit we make from the scrimmage will&nbsp;have a substantial impact on our program,&quot; said Portland State sports&nbsp;information director Larry Sellers. &quot;This is a major-league event for us&nbsp;in every way you can think of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOMECOMING: While many fans attending tonight's scrimmage will be&nbsp;coming to see former University of Oregon star Chris Miller, the&nbsp;quarterback most recognized in these parts may be Falcons assistant head&nbsp;coach/offense June Jones, who played at Portland State. A native of&nbsp;Portland who was instrumental in arranging the scrimmage, Jones passed&nbsp;for 3,518 yards and 25 touchdowns while operating the run-and-shoot&nbsp;offense as a senior at Portland State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons safety Tracey Eaton, a native of Medford, Ore., also played&nbsp;at Portland State. Free agent fullback Pat Chaffey, a native of North&nbsp;Marion, Ore., played at Oregon State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRIEFLY: The Falcons are close to a contract agreement with veteran&nbsp;defensive end Tim Green. . . . The three-year, $ 2.325 million contract&nbsp;signed Wednesday by first-round pick Mike Pritchard represents a 21&nbsp;percent hike over that signed by last year's 13th overall pick, Kansas&nbsp;City Chiefs linebacker Percy Snow.. . . The Falcons resume camp workouts&nbsp;with a 3 p.m. practice Sunday.. . . Eight players did not make the trip&nbsp;to Portland because of injuries. Three who did are doubtful to&nbsp;participate.</SPAN></P>

Valvano, who worked as an analyst for ABC and ESPN after&nbsp;leaving N.C. State in the wake of violations by team members, said he was&nbsp;assured of at least one victory against the German national team. &quot;I'll&nbsp;have NBA All-Stars Charles Barkley and David Robinson playing for me&nbsp;for that game,&quot; he said. But that will be their only appearance. The rest&nbsp;of the team will consist mainly of players who just finished college or&nbsp;with minor league pro experience.; Fly So Free wins Jim Dandy by 1 1/4</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fly So Free, beaten twice this year by Strike the Gold, held off a&nbsp;late charge by the Kentucky Derby champion to win the Grade II Jim Dandy&nbsp;Stakes at Saratoga on Sunday. Fly So Free, the 2-year-old champion, swept&nbsp;wide in the stretch to finish 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Upon My Soul. Three&nbsp;lengths further back was Strike the Gold, in his first start since losing&nbsp;the Belmont Stakes by a head to Hansel.; Ben Johnson not wanted for race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Johnson, once one of the biggest names in international track,&nbsp;is now being asked not to show up. Bengt Bendeus, organizer of an Aug. 5&nbsp;meet in Malmo, Sweden, said that he canceled a contract worth a reported&nbsp;$ 160,000 for Johnson to race against Carl Lewis and world record holder&nbsp;Leroy Burrell. Johnson finished fourth in the 100 meters at the Canadian&nbsp;national championships Saturday in a disappointing time of 10.42 seconds.; Puerto Rico beats USBL stars 93-86</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Ortiz, formerly of the Utah Jazz, scored 26 points to lead&nbsp;Puerto Rico to a 93-86 victory over a team of USBL all-stars in the&nbsp;championship game of the Winston World Basketball Cup in San Juan, Puerto&nbsp;Rico. It was the first time a team of U.S. professionals played in a&nbsp;tournament sanctioned by the International Amateur Basketball Federation.&nbsp;Wes Matthews and Lanard Copeland, who played for the Atlanta Eagles this&nbsp;season, scored 12 and six points, respectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kendrick Register knows what he wants to wear back to school.&nbsp;Shorts. Jeans that have been intentionally ripped in the knees. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air&nbsp;Jordans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for 8-year-old Kendrick, his mother has other ideas.&nbsp;Rita Register is buying her son &quot;nice&quot; pants - Dockers, Levi's 501 jeans,&nbsp;Duck Head khakis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Register is still in that enviable position of having control&nbsp;over her son's wardrobe. She also follows the cardinal rule of shopping&nbsp;for back-to-school clothes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the child with you. If you don't, what you buy may hang in the&nbsp;closet all year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cardinal rule is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set a budget, and make sure your children know how much you intend&nbsp;to spend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year, I spent close to $ 300 on his clothes, but that was for&nbsp;everything, including a winter coat,&quot; Mrs. Register said. &quot;The sneakers&nbsp;run us about $ 80, though. It depends on what the Jacksons - Michael or Bo&nbsp;- or Michael Jordan wear. That's what he wants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kendrick and his classmates at Powers Ferry Elementary School in&nbsp;Cobb County will be decked out in old favorite bluejeans and new, bright&nbsp;shirts and pants, according to Deborah Jacobs, the district manager for&nbsp;The Children's Place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boys will be wearing activewear, fleece tops and bottoms, denim and&nbsp;color-block woven tops. Denim in a relaxed-fit' style is popular,&quot; she&nbsp;said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For girls, the No. 1 look is activewear, also,&quot; Ms. Jacobs said.&nbsp;&quot;The big-over-small' look is big for girls, like mock turtlenecks over&nbsp;leggings or stirrup pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. 2 on the girls' list is denim, either blue or bright colors.&nbsp;Turtlenecks and sweaters with jeans are popular,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennis shoes are the footwear of choice for many youngsters, said&nbsp;Stride Rite's Amy Dodge. Some manufacturers have developed a washable&nbsp;leather sneaker, which is a favorite of the parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moms love sneakers they can wash,&quot; Ms. Dodge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dress shoes, durability and versatility are important. Saddle&nbsp;oxfords and camp mocs are popular sellers, Ms. Dodge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before spending money on a new wardrobe, parents need to keep in&nbsp;mind their school system's dress code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, tank tops are banned this year in the Marietta city&nbsp;schools, as are gang paraphernalia and pajama-like clothing. Students in&nbsp;Marietta will be sent home for baring their midriffs or for immodest&nbsp;dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cobb schools determine their own standards for dress, according to&nbsp;school system spokeswoman Barbara Robison. &quot;There are some things that&nbsp;are systemwide, but again, those are enforced locally by each school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principals in Atlanta schools make individual determinations as to&nbsp;what's app ropriate, according to a system spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents were advised to check with their local school or school&nbsp;system for changes to existing dress codes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clayton police said Karlos Brown, 16, of 78 Darwin Drive, was taken&nbsp;to his parents' home in the locked trunk of an automobile at 4 p.m. He&nbsp;had been beaten about the face and the front half of his head had been&nbsp;shaved, according to Clayton Police Lieutenant Doug Jewett.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also&nbsp;missing his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoes and a baseball cap, the lieutenant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager had apparently left home earlier in the day with the&nbsp;same four men who returned him to his home, Lieutenant Jewett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roderick Reid, 20, and Jerrmie Roberson, 18, both of Jonesboro, two&nbsp;of the men who allegedly brought the teenager home, were arrested and&nbsp;charged with aggravated assault and false imprisonment, Lieutenant Jewett&nbsp;said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS - Georgia scored a basketball recruiting coup Tuesday when&nbsp;Cedar Shoals forward Carlos Strong, whose strong showing this summer&nbsp;propelled him among the nation's top college prospects, said he would&nbsp;enroll next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kid is the next Dominique Wilkins ,&quot; said Bob Gibbons, a&nbsp;recruiting analyst. &quot;I saw Dominique play in high school, and I think&nbsp;Carlos at this stage is better than Dominique was. I think by the time we&nbsp;get to the end of the year, Carlos could be the very best player in the&nbsp;country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong, a 6-foot-8 preseason All-American, also considered Kentucky,&nbsp;Tennessee and Miami after earlier eliminating Nevada-Las Vegas,&nbsp;Georgetown and Syracuse. Verbal commitments are non-binding. High school&nbsp;players cannot sign national letters of intent until Nov. 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong, a first-team All-State Class AAAA player, averaged 15 points&nbsp;and eight rebounds last season. He was impressive at the prestigious </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;camp, a showcase of the country's top prep prospects, despite playing&nbsp;only two days after suffering a sprained ankle and broken tooth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong is the second of the nation's top five players to stay close&nbsp;to home. Guard Jason Kidd of Oakland stunned Kentucky and Kansas by&nbsp;committing to California last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like if you're good, people are going to know you're good&nbsp;whether you're on television a lot or not,&quot; Strong said. &quot;The main&nbsp;thing is to go somewhere where you're comfortable and I'm comfortable at&nbsp;Georgia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong has met the NCAA's core curriculum standards but failed to&nbsp;achieve the minimum SAT score of 700 on his first try. He plans to retake&nbsp;the test later this month. Strong missed eight games last season because&nbsp;of academic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia also remains in the running for Strong's Cedar Shoals&nbsp;teammate Terrell Bell. The 6-10 Bell has visited Alabama and Kentucky and&nbsp;will visit Temple, Clemson and Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Griffin High All-American Darrin Hancock, now at Garden City&nbsp;(Kan.) Junior College, has narrowed his choices to Georgia, Kansas and&nbsp;Kentucky.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEMPHIS - The word drops softly in a rich baritone, a towering&nbsp;double-breasted figure letting it go: Memphis. Willie Herenton tries to&nbsp;sell his mayoral candidacy with verse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must build coalitions that cut across race and class. I grow&nbsp;weary. . . . We have an opportunity to send a message to the nation that&nbsp;Memphis,&quot; he says slowly, his opponent two feet away, &quot;a city&nbsp;historically plagued by racial polarization, has made a sudden leap&nbsp;forward. Memphis . . .&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cadence evokes the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and is aimed&nbsp;beyond these 700 Rotarians, most of them white, gathered at The Peabody&nbsp;Hotel. It's aimed at the television cameras. The 6-foot-6 former Memphis&nbsp;school superintendent wants to be the first black mayor of this&nbsp;predominantly black city on the Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters will decide today whether he unseats popular incumbent Dick&nbsp;Hackett, who offers the flip side of the New South coin: economic&nbsp;development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hackett, a 42-year-old business guru without a college degree,&nbsp;as a career politician has managed to transform Memphis into an&nbsp;attractive trading post. Eighty-five businesses, including such titans as&nbsp;Federal Express, International Paper and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have expanded or relocated&nbsp;here in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Herenton, 51, grew up in a housing project 15 blocks from what&nbsp;is now a glimmering downtown. The same determination that made him a&nbsp;Golden Gloves boxing champion earned him a doctorate and made him the&nbsp;first black school superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a post he held with distinction from 1978 until June. Only&nbsp;once was he tempted to leave. In 1987, the Atlanta school board offered&nbsp;him its top job. He accepted, only to withdraw weeks later, after an&nbsp;impassioned plea from the community to stay in Memphis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If ever there is a time for Memphis to elect a black mayor and join&nbsp;Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans, and five of the nation's top 10&nbsp;cities, it is now. Timing, demographics and justice may be on its side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Census figures show that 55 percent of Memphis's 610,000 residents&nbsp;are black. And the U.S. Justice Department filed a voting rights suit&nbsp;against the city to abolish at-large council seats and run-off elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders, who had never united behind a sole candidate for&nbsp;mayor despite only one black ever winning a citywide race, met during the&nbsp;summer to pick a consensus choice. That process ended up anything but&nbsp;unified when two coalitions warred over whose voice would be heeded: the&nbsp;traditional politicians led by U.S. Rep. Harold Ford or activists at a&nbsp;People's Convention.  Mr. Herenton emerged as the candidate of both, but&nbsp;not without casualties. Mr. Ford waited until the final week to lend his&nbsp;presence to the campaign and apparently chose not to issue a traditional&nbsp;endorsement ballot on Mr. Herenton's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Carpenter, Mr. Herenton's campaign manager, warns that no&nbsp;one should underestimate Mr. Herenton's appeal, which peaked after he&nbsp;decided to take the Atlanta job. &quot;At that point it was clear to him,&nbsp;clear to the community, that Willie Herenton was a leader, a role model,&nbsp;and a mentor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incumbent has adopted the look of a winner, attending official&nbsp;functions, dropping in on shopping centers and making speeches only at&nbsp;private fund raisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Hackett says he is running on his nine-year City Hall record,&nbsp;one he claims is marked by sound management of services, no tax increases&nbsp;and a thriving economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely does he mention Mr. Herenton by name, nor are race relations&nbsp;given much comment. Instead he points to six black top city directors -&nbsp;most appointed in the past two years - as examples of his administration&nbsp;of inclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign manager Bill Boyd says the mayor might get up to 15 percent&nbsp;of the black vote as a result of black dissension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has nearly three times the campaign funds of Mr. Herenton,&nbsp;or $ 660,000, enabling him to barrage viewers this week with television&nbsp;ads.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities were trying Saturday to identify a jogger who was lying&nbsp;unconscious at Piedmont Hospital after being struck by a car on West&nbsp;Paces Ferry Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very clean-cut looking,&quot; said hospital spokeswoman Linda&nbsp;Tucker. &quot;His clothes seem pretty expensive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim is about 30 years old, white, 5-foot-8 and 170 pounds&nbsp;with a muscular build and dark brown wavy hair. He was wearing black&nbsp;running shorts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoes and a black sports watch. He has three&nbsp;tattoos - a leprechaun on his right chin, a dragon on his left shoulder&nbsp;and an eagle on his right arm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has a very serious head injury,&quot; Ms. Tucker said. &quot;Right now&nbsp;it's very grave.  Doctors desperately need to talk to family to see if&nbsp;there are any other medical conditions they should be aware of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the jogger was in the path of traffic when he was hit&nbsp;on Friday. No charges were filed against the driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARENTS OF TEENAGE SHOOTING SUSPECT SUED: The parents of a 14-year-&nbsp;old who shot another youth during a basketball game are being sued for&nbsp;negligence because they allegedly left their son alone at home with&nbsp;access to a vehicle and a weapon. The $ 5.5 million lawsuit in Gwinnett&nbsp;State Court alleges that Edward and Denise Nestor &quot;were aware of their&nbsp;son's dangerous propensities.&quot; Casey Brennan, 13, of Snellville was shot&nbsp;between the eyes on June 27. His parents, John and Pamela Brennan, say he&nbsp;has lost sight in one eye. Testimony indicated the Nestors' son, whose&nbsp;name is being withheld, drove his parents' van to a neighborhood&nbsp;basketball game and attempted to shoot Casey's brother, then shot Casey.&nbsp;A Gwinnett Juvenile Court judge ruled the youth committed aggravated&nbsp;battery. He faces a maximum sentence of 18 months in juvenile detention;&nbsp;sentencing is set for Oct. 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLARKSTON MAN HELD IN SLAYING OF FEMALE IMPERSONATOR: A 29-year-old&nbsp;Clarkston man has been charged in the Sept. 26 slaying of a female&nbsp;impersonator in Knoxville. Investigators charged Samuel U. McDowell with&nbsp;murder in the strangulation death of Frank W. Wilson, 46, who was choked&nbsp;with a telephone cord at his house. Mr. McDowell was taken into custody&nbsp;Wednesday in DeKalb County after he made an abrupt turn in front of&nbsp;officers, police said. He was driving a car that belonged to Mr. Wilson,&nbsp;investigators said. Mr. Wilson, who used the stage name &quot;Francine,&quot;&nbsp;performed part time at a Knoxville nightclub. He also had worked for&nbsp;several years at a finance company. Mr. McDowell also was charged with&nbsp;theft of a vehicle. He is being held in the Knox County Intake Center in&nbsp;lieu of $ 22,000 bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO HURT AS FIRE DESTROYS EAST POINT WAREHOUSE: An abandoned East&nbsp;Point cotton warehouse was destroyed Saturday morning in a blaze that&nbsp;sent two firefighters to the hospital with minor injuries. The fire in&nbsp;the two-story wood and brick warehouse at 1149 Central Ave. was reported&nbsp;at 12:46 a.m., and crews were still tending hotspots Saturday night, said&nbsp;East Point Fire Department Battalion Chief Ronnie Few. One firefighter&nbsp;was treated for smoke inhalation, and one slipped and fell on debris.&nbsp;Both were released from South Fulton Hospital. The cause of the fire had&nbsp;not been determined Saturday, but Chief Few said vagrants have been seen&nbsp;in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO INDICTED IN DALTON SLAYING, INCLUDING VICTIM'S WIFE: A Whitfield&nbsp;County grand jury has returned murder indictments against a Dalton man&nbsp;and the wife of the victim. Debra Thomas, 33, of Hartford, Ky., and&nbsp;formerly of Dalton, was indicted on murder charges in the strangulation&nbsp;of her husband, Roger Dale Thomas, 31, in May. The grand jury also&nbsp;indicted Jeffery Sean Roberts, 34, of Dalton on a murder charge. Tammy&nbsp;Rochelle Carpenter, 20, of Dalton was indicted for concealing Mr.&nbsp;Thomas's death. His body was found May 13 alongside Lake Allatoona by a&nbsp;fisherman. He had been strangled with a small rope. Mrs. Thomas filed a&nbsp;missing persons report May 11, telling police she last saw her husband&nbsp;when she dropped him off at a Dalton lounge. Detectives have said no one&nbsp;at the lounge recalled seeing Mr. Thomas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WATERING BAN LIFTED IN CHATSWORTH: Chatsworth residents now can&nbsp;water their lawns and wash their cars without guilt. The city water works&nbsp;lifted its monthlong ban on outside water use Friday after decreased&nbsp;industrial and residential demand boosted the supply. &quot;If people still&nbsp;conserve and not be wasteful, I think we'll be OK,&quot; said water works&nbsp;superintendent Tom Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONVICTED COLUMBUS MURDERER WON'T GET THE CHAIR: Jerry Lee Everett&nbsp;of Columbus has escaped the death penalty by pleading guilty to a 1988&nbsp;murder and armed robbery. Everett, 36, pleaded guilty Friday to the Oct.&nbsp;2, 1988, fatal shooting of Rudolph E. Williams behind the Traffic Light&nbsp;Lounge. Mr. Williams was shot in the head five times. Muscogee Superior&nbsp;Court Judge William Smith sentenced Everett to two life terms for murder&nbsp;and armed robbery and five years for using a firearm during those crimes.&nbsp;The sentences will run concurrently. Assistant District Attorney Ed Berry&nbsp;said Everett's videotaped confession as well as his action in calling&nbsp;police and telling them he committed the crimes led to the offer to&nbsp;escape a possible death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCINTOSH CLERK SUES COMMISSION OVER FIRING: A former McIntosh County&nbsp;tax commission clerk is suing county commissioners, claiming she was&nbsp;illegally fired after her arrest on forgery charges. Dotheria Robinson&nbsp;was arrested in February 1990 for cashing a check that was drawn by a&nbsp;third party and given to her husband. The charge was later dismissed on a&nbsp;technicality. Nine months after her arrest, the McIntosh commission voted&nbsp;to suspend Mrs. Robinson indefinitely. Her suit, filed in U.S. District&nbsp;Court in Brunswick, claims the commission usurped the authority of Mrs.&nbsp;Robinson's boss, the tax commissioner, and failed to follow county policy&nbsp;on firing employees. The suit says commissioners routinely ignore policy&nbsp;when firing black employees, like Mrs. Robinson. She is seeking&nbsp;unspecified back pay and damages, and reinstatement in her job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEDS ASK GROVETOWN TO RETURN EPA FUNDS: Federal environmental&nbsp;officials are asking the city of Grovetown to return $ 169,000 for failing&nbsp;to award a 1986 sewer plant contract to the lowest bidder. Mayor Dennis&nbsp;Trudeau said the Environmental Protection Agency provided a $ 2 million&nbsp;grant for the city's wastewater plant, which was built after three&nbsp;separate contracts were awarded for segments of the work. W.L. Carey&nbsp;Construction Co. was the low bidder on the first two contracts, but&nbsp;Beacon Industries Inc. was the low bidder on the third contract by about&nbsp;$ 269,000, Mayor Trudeau said. City officials gave the entire project to&nbsp;the Carey firm after it agreed to drop $ 100,000 off the price of each of&nbsp;the three contracts. Although the $ 300,000 discount on all three&nbsp;contracts made Carey the low overall bidder, EPA decided that Beacon&nbsp;should have been awarded the third contract. EPA has ordered the city to&nbsp;repay the $ 168,000 difference between the low bid and the Carey price on&nbsp;the third contract. Mayor Trudeau, who was not mayor at the time, said the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet of late, Michael Jordan's halo is teetering, threatening to&nbsp;tilt, and all because of a Meet-the-President photo shoot last week in&nbsp;the Rose Garden.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath, Jordan's absence was added to the growing list of&nbsp;national crises. He was found guilty of a conspiracy of one, of (ye&nbsp;gads!) orchestrating a solo plot, a snub, against the Prez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children cried. Mothers cringed. Both suggested that Jordan be&nbsp;flogged with a bowl of wet Wheaties, or, at the least, be grounded by a&nbsp;pair of P.F. Flyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, including members of the Chicago media, deemed a verbal&nbsp;spanking more appropriate.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan must indeed be a man of few sins. Unless we missed it, he&nbsp;does not use drugs. He pays his bills on time. He loves his children. In&nbsp;general, he comports himself like a gentleman, the same which can not&nbsp;always be said of his brethren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Bird shoots his mouth off and often hits his own foot. Charles&nbsp;Barkley shoots his mouth off and hits both feet. Isiah Thomas, both feet&nbsp;and both ankles. Magic Johnson keeps mum. Much safer that way. Until&nbsp;recently, so did Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First he hinted that he might prefer golf to the Olympics. Amid a&nbsp;sizable uproar, he quickly reconsidered. Then he was blamed - unfairly -&nbsp;for Thomas's absence on the U.S. squad. Now he is perceived as sticking&nbsp;out his very famous tongue at Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were he more of an activist, Jordan's absence might have suggested&nbsp;that Bush tend to the weeds in the back of his other garden, the one that&nbsp;provides a less-than-rosy vision of America, featuring its homeless, the&nbsp;health-care crisis, unemployed workers, our illiterate children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jordan's statement was personal and pragmatic, though impolitic&nbsp;as well. He simply chose to spend the final days of the offseason with&nbsp;his children, which, given the state of the American family, ought to be&nbsp;commended.; He owed fans answer, not justification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush most assuredly will recover more quickly than our economy. So&nbsp;will the Bulls, even those angered by a perceived double standard, and so&nbsp;will Jordan, though the MVP has gained new insights into the plight of&nbsp;the superstar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble with sports heroes is that they aren't angels. They may&nbsp;leap into the heavens but they eventually land, often with a thud. Even,&nbsp;the Michael Jordans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one sense, his timing is lousy. Bird had Magic. Magic had Bird.&nbsp;They were basketball's dueling duo of the 80s, enemies, then rivals, and&nbsp;ultimately friends, each one's actions measured by the other's. Together,&nbsp;they shared the glories and the burdens of superstardom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would always say, What would Larry do?' &quot; Magic once admitted,&nbsp;deep in thought. &quot; How would he react?' Having him out there . . . well,&nbsp;we helped each other's careers in a lot of different ways. We understand&nbsp;each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jordan stands alone. He lacks the kinship of a Magic-Bird, and&nbsp;unlike his predecessors, veteran teammates with the stature of a McHale,&nbsp;Parish, DJ, Kareem, Wilkes, Worthy, Nixon. Jordan has only Jordan.&nbsp;Pippen? Not yet. Horace Grant? Just another good player. John Paxson?&nbsp;Right place at the right time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Jordan is to be chided, it is only for this: He owed his fans the&nbsp;answer to his whereabouts. Not a justification. An answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But irresponsible? Disturbing? Irrational? Nonsense. Jordan should&nbsp;simply tell the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just explain that he's a Democrat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauly Chu, a kindergarten teacher at Canby Lane Elementary School,&nbsp;structures her class in the normal fashion of most other kindergarten&nbsp;teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They read some, do math, learn Chinese, take naps and have play time&nbsp;- yes, they have been learning Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chu, a Chinese-born American citizen, spends at least 30&nbsp;minutes a day teaching the 5-year-olds numbers in Chinese, math on an&nbsp;abacus and Chinese characters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she doesn't stop there. Some old Chinese culture is also&nbsp;incorporated into her classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, according to Mrs. Chu, the old way was the best way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A long time ago in China, the teacher was more important than the&nbsp;parents,&quot; Mrs. Chu said. &quot;Discipline and respect was incorporated in the&nbsp;school; the most important thing was respect to the teacher. But when I&nbsp;came to the United States, I saw that that's not always the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowing when thankful is natural for the 15 students who sometimes&nbsp;wear Chinese farmer hats made out of paper. Five-year-old Michael&nbsp;Witherspoon wishes everybody would do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Learning Chinese makes me happy,&quot; Michael said. &quot;I think everybody&nbsp;should bow and say thank you' because it's a really nice thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exposure is also important to Mrs. Chu. She believes understanding&nbsp;different cultures makes for better relations in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My students can see that I'm different from them, they know that&nbsp;that difference is that I'm Chinese,&quot; Mrs. Chu said. &quot;Sharing some of my&nbsp;culture with them helps them understand that difference is a way of life,&nbsp;that it could be good and there is no reason to feel threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown-eyed Benjamin Carson credits Mrs. Chu with helping him make&nbsp;his career choice. The 5-year-old Stone Mountain resident said he wants&nbsp;to be a Chinese-speaking &quot;rocketeer&quot; when he grows up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They love her - both kids and parents,&quot; said Mary Dugett, the&nbsp;school's principal. &quot;We have parents that come in wanting to see the&nbsp;teacher who teaches Chinese. After watching her, they inquire about&nbsp;getting their kid in her class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't learn Chinese at my old school,&quot; 5-year-old Desiree&nbsp;Hillman said. &quot;But Mrs. Chu is a Chinese teacher, and I like her because&nbsp;she teaches Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chu said she's proud to have the opportunity to teach children&nbsp;another language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really think Americans should learn more than one language,&quot; she&nbsp;said, &quot;and I'm happy to be able to contribute towards that goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the unsavory types you would not want around your children.&nbsp;If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware&nbsp;upon their departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting&nbsp;five-figure contracts to try and sell you on what deodorant you should&nbsp;put under your arms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid&nbsp;distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles&nbsp;Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside&nbsp;and threw water on another fan last season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a&nbsp;former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger&nbsp;than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the&nbsp;Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive&nbsp;steroid test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why would Gillette, the makers of Right Guard, spend money on&nbsp;these guys?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are playing off their bad boy image,&quot; says a spokesperson for&nbsp;N.W. Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. &quot;It's the way&nbsp;the campaign is supposed to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,&quot; says Gary Wichard,&nbsp;Bosworth's agent.&nbsp; So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,&quot; says David Falk, vice-&nbsp;chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host&nbsp;of athletes, including the Atlanta Hawks' Dominique Wilkins. &quot;But I've&nbsp;got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased&nbsp;awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in&nbsp;contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what are the bounds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,&quot; says Bob&nbsp;Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San&nbsp;Francisco. &quot;With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea&nbsp;can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorfman points to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe commercial that ran after Barkley&nbsp;had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial,&nbsp;David Robinson, the clean-imaged center for the San Antonio Spurs and&nbsp;another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorser, asks Barkley, &quot;Can you spell fine, Charles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is a line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of&nbsp; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving&nbsp;charge,&quot; Dorfman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi&nbsp;Berra said, &quot;Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who&quot; back in the 1950s.&nbsp;And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday&nbsp;Night Fights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft&nbsp;drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches&nbsp;are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver&nbsp;Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Sabatini and Steffi Graf, both tennis players, rank among&nbsp;the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is&nbsp;largely a man's game in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tennis and golf both have international appeal,&quot; says Clive Chajet,&nbsp;chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an&nbsp;identity consulting firm. &quot;But in the U.S. the hottest market right now&nbsp;are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wider U.S. market, women athletes have a much more limited&nbsp;appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play&nbsp;tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just&nbsp;because Monica Seles wears the same kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid&nbsp;athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the&nbsp;salaries their teams pay them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a&nbsp;Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is&nbsp;paying Jordan a reported $ 19 million over 10 years to try and get people&nbsp;to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;contract went unrevealed but advertising executives suspect it was the&nbsp;single largest endorsement deal ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at&nbsp;$ 10 to $ 15 million yearly. His salary is $ 2.1 million annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael transcends everything,&quot; says Chajet. &quot;His image has&nbsp;redefined marketing.&quot;&nbsp; Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped&nbsp;from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $ 5&nbsp;million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image&nbsp;is of common man perfection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a&nbsp;sought-after endorser,&quot; says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns&nbsp;Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. &quot;There has got to be personality and&nbsp;a sense of acceptance of the person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes&nbsp;have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their&nbsp;image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are&nbsp;former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger&nbsp;Jose Canseco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and&nbsp;steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins&nbsp;with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation&nbsp;for multiple traffic offenses. And after being a no-show at numerous&nbsp;public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could&nbsp;hear his side of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to&nbsp;cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone&nbsp;his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander&nbsp;Holyfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,&quot; Dorfman says.&nbsp;&quot;He's scary . . . You have to have some pleasantness about you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of &quot;pleasantness&quot; has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988&nbsp;Pepsi agreed to pay him about $ 1 million to push its products, but the&nbsp;contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former&nbsp;wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only so many dollars out there for the credible&nbsp;athletes,&quot; says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former&nbsp;Brave Dale Murphy. &quot;The involvement costs are too high to gamble with.&nbsp;The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message&nbsp;out in front of the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a&nbsp;star, there is some degree of risk,&quot; Chajet says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To most, the line is distinct: Law-breakers are taboo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of&nbsp;legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,&quot; says Lanktree.&nbsp;&quot;Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And&nbsp;I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to&nbsp;be all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of&nbsp;sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records&nbsp;after testing positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Johnson did not have a many lucrative endorsement contracts,&nbsp;the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international&nbsp;possibilities for him, Lanktree says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,&quot; she says. &quot;What he did was&nbsp;not illegal, but he totally lost all his value as a spokesperson .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult,&nbsp;unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality&nbsp;cinched it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is&nbsp;a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-&nbsp;Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever Boggs's attitudes was, he was not seen by the people of&nbsp;Boston as s aying, Screw you. I don't care what you think,' &quot; she says.&nbsp;&quot;On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think&nbsp;that was very significant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing&nbsp;products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Jordan deal was monstrous,&quot; says Dorfman. &quot;How much Gatorade&nbsp;will people have to drink for that much money to pay for itself? But I&nbsp;think what it says is that advertisers think the market is bottomless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more,&quot; says Lanktree. &quot;I don't know that there is a&nbsp;limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dave's commercials are a lot like sausages,&quot; joke creators Paul&nbsp;Basile and Jim McKennan. &quot;If you like them, you probably don't want to&nbsp;see them being made.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas will sign copies of his book, &quot;Dave's Way,&quot; from 1 to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. today at Oxford Book Store on Pharr Road. An adopted child, Thomas&nbsp;is President George Bush's national spokesperson on adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING?: There was lawyer John Johnson at the&nbsp;World Series the other night, having a great time and entertaining&nbsp;clients, when he was paged in the third inning and told by wife Chris&nbsp;that their son Drew, 4, could not be found. She wanted Johnson to check&nbsp;for him in, of all places, his car, remembering that Drew had pleaded to&nbsp;go with his dad to the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson got to the parking lot, he saw several police officers&nbsp;encircling the car. They were talking to Drew, who had climbed into the&nbsp;back seat, fallen asleep and was now awake. Johnson took him home and&nbsp;returned to the game, missing two innings. &quot;I'm not sure he's learned his&nbsp;lesson,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;He thought he was a celebrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KNOWING THE AUDIENCE: Pity the person scheduling an event these past&nbsp;couple of weeks without taking Braves fever into account. Cartier sent&nbsp;mailgrams Fri day informing those planning to attend the gala opening of&nbsp;its Lenox Square store Sunday that TV monitors would be placed &quot;so that&nbsp;no fan will have to worry about missing the game.&quot; . . . Santa Claus,&nbsp;scheduled to arrive at CNN Center today to initiate the local Toys for&nbsp;Tots drive, switched the trip to Nov. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOOD OBSERVATION: Members of a second-grade class at Fifth Avenue&nbsp;Elementary School in Decatur wondered why the World Series is being&nbsp;called &quot;the Cinderella Series.&quot; The teacher read &quot;Cinderella,&quot; then asked&nbsp;if they noticed any similarities between the story and the World Series.&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; said student Jamarco Williams. &quot;They both get over at midnight.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes Father knows best. But other times you've got to make your&nbsp;own choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lesson Greg Asman learned in last year's AT&amp;T Collegiate&nbsp;Investment Challenge when he bought stock in his father's company,&nbsp;Schlumberger Industries - and lost money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the last time I'm going to do that,&quot; said Greg, a junior at&nbsp;North Springs High School in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily, he had stuffed his portfolio with other stocks, including&nbsp;NCR Corp., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. and Walt Disney Co., so he still managed an&nbsp;imaginary four-month profit of about $ 200,000 on his $ 500,000 investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, about 12 students from North Springs's 70-member chapter&nbsp;of Future Business Leaders of America are playing in the contest's high&nbsp;school division. Each has paid $ 39.95 for a contest kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and Feb. 28, their goal is to turn a fictional half-&nbsp;million-dollar investment into a money-making machine. They're competing&nbsp;against about 12,000 high school students nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rules of the trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants trade stocks by calling an 800 number during regular&nbsp;stock market hours. They can buy stocks on margin by borrowing from the&nbsp;&quot;broker,&quot; Wall Street Portfolios, or sell stocks short. A commission is&nbsp;charged for each transaction. Each player is allowed 50 transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 students who can make their portfolios grow the most win the&nbsp;contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After making six-figure stock deals, the $ 1,000 prize may seem like&nbsp;chump change. It's a good thing they're not all in it for the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Reynolds, a junior who is a novice in the world of high finance,&nbsp;is looking at the contest as a learning experience and expects &quot;hard&nbsp;study&quot; ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's encouraging to the business club's advisers, teachers Mary&nbsp;Henson and Cindy Greene. Ms. Henson says the contest is a &quot;great&nbsp;opportunity for kids - lots better than anything we can simulate in&nbsp;class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock preferences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several students are using research from class to choose&nbsp;investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophomore Jay Carroll is considering investing in Pepsico, a company&nbsp;he researched for an economics class. He's also thinking about baseball&nbsp;card makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg is considering &quot;stocks based in the South, just because I don't&nbsp;think the recession has hit as hard here.&quot; He also likes airline stocks,&nbsp;Disney and Microsoft Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Greg's experience last year, several students are investing&nbsp;in a parent's company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Seidband's father works for IBM Corp. &quot;I'm putting my money in&nbsp;IBM and Hershey,&quot; said Marc, a senior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His investment strategy: &quot;Buy low, sell high. That's all you need to&nbsp;know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learning from pros</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may be the key to winning AT&amp;T's four-month-long contest,&nbsp;actual investors must look at things a little differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillip M. Larkins, director of investments for Bank South Corp.,&nbsp;suggests remaining in the market at least three years, because in the&nbsp;short term, &quot;you can be blindsided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market is volatile, subject to major moves up and down,&quot; he&nbsp;said. So if you stay in stocks for a short period, &quot;you're speculating,&nbsp;rather than investing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Dasher, a Georgia Tech student who was the top-placing national&nbsp;sophomore in last year's college division, agrees that real investors&nbsp;must have a long-term perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining why, he invoked the name of the legendary former manager&nbsp;of Fidelity Investments' high-flying Magellan Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't have one good three-month stint in the contest,&quot; Mr.&nbsp;Dasher said, &quot;and think you'll be the next Peter Lynch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Hodges coaches and&nbsp;teaches at Metter High while Hite does the same at Statesboro High.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLACK SUNDAY: Alma Alta, the Soviet basketball team in town to play&nbsp;Georgia State today in an exhibition, asked to meet &quot;the football coach&nbsp;in black,&quot; no doubt reminded of their own KGB. So the 17 Soviets watched&nbsp;the Falcons practice Friday and the man in black, Jerry Glanville, came&nbsp;up with 17 tickets for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE &amp; THERE: Michael Jordan drew a $ 250 fine from coach Phil&nbsp;Jackson for sleeping through a practice. George Shirk of the San&nbsp;Francisco Chronicle computed the fine was equivalent to a $ 50,000-a-year&nbsp;person losing 60 cents. . . . The Bulls' Scottie Pippen has his name on a&nbsp;new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe that'll hit stores next month. The shoes will be called Air&nbsp;Flight Mid. . . . New Notre Dame coach John MacLeod has renamed the Irish&nbsp;basketball arena The Thunderdome. That's the nickname the school is using&nbsp;for a marketing campaign. MacLeod wants to enliven games with all the&nbsp;hoopla that surrounds NBA contests. . . . Louisville coach Denny Crum has&nbsp;a 75-acre horse ranch in Kentucky. Says Crum: &quot;When I get out of&nbsp;coaching, I plan to train thoroughbreds I've raised on my own.&quot; Might be&nbsp;less stressful for him. Whoever heard of graduation rates for horses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIM SHOT: After Orlando rookie center Stanley Roberts shattered two&nbsp;backboards in practice, team GM Pat Williams came up with a way to raise&nbsp;money for charity. The club collected the shards, put them into bags and&nbsp;is selling them to fans for $ 10 a bag. At the first game - labeled as&nbsp;&quot;Roberts' Rim Wreckage&quot; - 34 were sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUOTABLE: After a 7-0 loss to Minnesota, Maple Leafs coach Tom Watt&nbsp;said: &quot;It's pretty tough to find anything positive in this one. We didn't&nbsp;tear the jerseys - I guess that's it.&quot; . . . FSU's Bobby Bowden says&nbsp;today's showdown vs. Miami will not be the biggest game he has ever&nbsp;coached: &quot;I have a lifetime contract. The biggest games I ever coached&nbsp;were when I had a one-year contract.&quot; . . . Oiler defensive end Sean&nbsp;Jones, on the Cowboys: &quot;The Cowboys are like a bunch of little maggots.&nbsp;Right when you get them off you, they keep coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIP RIPS DUKE: Former Georgia Tech assistant and current James&nbsp;Madison football coach Rip Scherer said he will withdraw his name from&nbsp;consideration for the Tulane job if David Duke wins Louisiana's&nbsp;gubernatorial election today. &quot;It's a matter of principle. You'd be&nbsp;endorsing Duke's philosophy. I wouldn't want my name associated with&nbsp;anything of that kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAPPENINGS: Quarterback Chris Miller and 15 Atlanta Falcons&nbsp;teammates will sign autographs for charity today from 1 to 3 p.m. at&nbsp;Baselines Sports Cards in Duluth. Autographs of all players can be&nbsp;received for a $ 10 donation, which goes to the Christian Council of Metro&nbsp;Atlanta Shelter for Women and Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO?: What a quarterback matchup - Steve Bono vs. Stan Gelbaugh.&nbsp;That's the 49ers vs. the Cardinals in case you don't recognize the names.&nbsp;How obscure are they? The 49ers couldn't find a scouting report on&nbsp;Gelbaugh. No wonder. He's been signed and released 20 times by eight&nbsp;teams in three leagues since 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GREAT GUY: Tampa Bay linebacker Broderick Thomas was named NFC&nbsp;defensive player of the week after 11 tackles and two sacks against the&nbsp;Lions. He immediately announced his desire to renegotiate the remaining&nbsp;two years of his five-year, $ 4.3 million contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW WORD: Before fighting Ray Mercer, heavyweight Tommy Morrison&nbsp;said: &quot;Losing is not in my vocabulary.&quot; During the fight, says the Boston&nbsp;Globe's Ron Borges &quot;Mercer made unconsciousness part of Morrison's&nbsp;vocabulary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors pushed stock prices sharply higher for much of the day&nbsp;Monday, although a late sell-off deflated most of the gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip industrial stocks, up as much&nbsp;as 19 points just 15 minutes before the market's regular close, ended the&nbsp;day with a gain of 4.69 points to 2,919.05 in fairly heavy trading.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was enough to keep alive the market's advance, which began last&nbsp;week. On Monday, the prospect of another interest rate cut by the&nbsp;Federal Reserve was enough to stimulate buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is expected to decide&nbsp;the issue when it meets in Washington today, although analysts said there&nbsp;is no guarantee a cut in rates would occur the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the market is still cautious in light of the weak economy,&nbsp;some analysts interpreted the Dow's latest gains as further evidence that&nbsp;the worst of the market's monthlong slide may be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert S. Robbins, market strategist for Robinson-Humphrey, said the&nbsp;Dow's low of 2,844 last Wednesday may have been the start of the market's&nbsp;usual year-end rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Monday's trading, two companies with improved earnings posted&nbsp;gains: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> up $ 2.62 1/2 to $ 64.50 after reporting second-quarter&nbsp;earnings of 80 cents a share against 77 cents a year ago, and Circuit&nbsp;City, up 12 1/2 cents to $ 23.25 after reporting earnings of 19 cents a&nbsp;share versus 5 cents a year earlier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'THEY kill for Reebok pumps. You only get mugged for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Air - they're commoner.' So I was informed by my 11-year-old son, who had just returned from the first day at his new secondary school wearing the gleaming pair of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Airs which had gobbled up most of the household fund the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a remark going straight to the heart of a moral dilemma which, if the conversations I took part in during the last weeks of the holidays are anything to go by, has caught parents of children in our style-conscious society, where status currently resides in footwear, by the short and curlies. Should we succumb and fork out inordinate sums of money for shoes which, to the uninitiated, look much like those available at a fraction of the price, just because they carry the crucial name and have the attraction of added air?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If common sense were the only guide, the answer should be a resounding no. But we are a child-centred generation of parents and we know only too well the depth of the anguish our young may feel if they cannot hold their own among their peer group. I still remember how mortified I felt when my mother adapted an ancient, baggy pair of her ski trousers for me, when everyone else on the school trip had the sleek, chic elasticated kind. For our kids, starting at new schools, there seemed to be a particular urgency to reach a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there was a practical side to the dilemma. In the US there have been cases of youngsters murdered for their expensive, ultra-fashionable shoes, and not long ago the son of a friend of mine was 'persuaded' by a couple of heavies at a north London bowling alley to accompany them to a quiet spot and part company with his new, modish trainers. What sort of parent is willingly going to put their kid to that kind of risk when a pair of cheapo, label-less shoes are risk-free?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistically, my son pointed out, this argument is thin - no more than half a dozen cases of nasty incidents concerning shoes have been reported and in our circle just two are known about. And, he asked in his most persuasive, hectoring manner, how many pairs of fashionable shoes are bought and worn by young people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But let's get to the heart of the moral dilemma. How can we right-on parents, desperately trying to impart values which will challenge the superficial materialism of our age - a culture in which the adman rules and you are admired more for how you look than who you are - go out and buy our kids these absurdly over-priced shoes, thus confirming the idea that this is where their status lies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British Telecom lines crackled with the anguished sound of the older generation battling with its conscience as the start of the new term drew near.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My conclusion was that there are times, the first day at a new school being one of them, when my principles, my pious pride in being seen to provide the right ethical environment for my young, have to go hang. Watching Cato putting on his new purple and white shoes with enormous pride, seeing the boost they gave to his confidence as he set off to school, I was glad he had them. It might not be the most satisfactory or the most enduring way to build self-esteem but as a one-off it had real value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He arrived home after the first couple of days happy with the school, pleased to be making new friends, excited even about his homework. I can't help feeling that if he had not felt so sure about his image, he might not have felt so positive about all these other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was not, apparently, alone in my judgment. Walking into the entrance hall of my son's new school that first day, the most striking sight was a dazzling array of feet in state-of-the-art footwear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: Drug testing<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Rod:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just received a copy of the proposal on drug testing and have some comments to make on it and a small favor to ask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning first to the Report, I think that it spends too much time of the details of legislation without explaining why we need any legislation at all, especially for private employers.  I agree that drug testing is a hot and sensitive issues.  People do not like to be tested even if they are innocent, and firms are uneasy about having workers who use drugs (or alcohol) on their workforce, both for the safety and business risks that they could cause, and the more diffuse reputational risks that go with trying to maintain a client base.  So clearly some balance has to be drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulty with your report is that it asks only one question, not two.  The question asked is the second in the sequence: what should be the nature of the balance between firm and individual?  The prior question is who should make the balance?  I find it a little ironic that a Bill of Rights Institute, which should be dedicated to keeping government at bay instinctively leaps to a legislative solution.  Why not the contractual solution?  There are of course some problems with disclosure and variations in terms, but skilled drafting can deal with those problems especially on an institutional issue of such moment and import.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*178]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One advantage of the contract solution is it does not require once-and-for all balancing.  Stated otherwise, there is an implicit assumption in your report that all firms have roughly the same interest, and all workers have roughly the same interests.  But why should this be so, even within certain categories of workers (e.g. high or low risk jobs).  The best way in which to find out the relative intensity of preferences (even legitimate preferences) is to have them in bidding tension with each other.  If an employer says that we regard this as very important, then it has to be prepared to pay the price.  It will lose some workers who do not want to go through the testing, or it will make accommodations on wages or other terms of employment.  Some employees will find the deal not to their liking, but they can seek out another firm whose policies they find more congenial.  There is a sorting equilibrium, so that firms which want extensive testing get workers who are relatively indifferent to the indignities involved.  There is no reason to ask whether the concern with drugs is &quot;justified&quot; with reference to the workplace.  The standards of relevance are defined internal to the workplace, and do not have to be validated in any public forum.  Likewise there is no need to figure out what kinds of jobs call for random testing and which only allow it to be for cause.  There are private solutions that courts can enforce.  There is no need to convert intelligent hunches into binding law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This position should help with drug enforcement.  I suspect that the balance on this issue in the marketplace is more toward testing than you would like, but I don't think it is a bad thing.  The standard enforcement of drug policies is coercive.  The state takes after those who seek to mind their own business.  Here the employer in effect waits until private individuals come to it.  Keeping off drugs now gets you something you want, and as the incidence of drug use is reduced, the external benefits to the rest of us should increase.  Drug testing by employers can operate as a (relatively) efficient substitute for public enforcement.  Why then treat it with such deep suspicion and concern?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a second element that needs a brief mention as well: government employees.  Does the fourth amendment have anything to do with the types of drug tests that should be imposed.  I think not.  Here is a case where consent by individual workers should be sufficient to validate the consent.  While I am a great fan of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, I don't think that it has any application where the government functions in some sort of a competitive system, but should be reserved to those cases where its monopoly position (with regulation or taxation) carries with it the prospect of abuse.  So in this regard I don't think that the public/private distinction is of much moment, although it surely is in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which gets me to my brief favor: You mention in your report that there are lots of statutes that now work on the area.  Is there any memo or collection of materials that you have that I could see.  I might want to include &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*179]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  something on this question in a book on which I am working -- &quot;Bargaining with the State&quot; which is an expansion and revision of my Harvard Foreword on Unconstitutional Conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 5, 1990<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dr. Paul Marcus, Professor of Law, College of Law, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Dr. Marcus:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>This is in reference to your letter of August 16, 1990, in which you requested that I provide you with a position paper regarding some of the issues under consideration by the Task Force for the Drug Testing Project of the Institute of Bill of Rights, College of William and Mary.  It will indeed be my pleasure and honor to provide you with the material you requested.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Drug testing is a valuable and effective tool in combatting drug abuse.  The ultimate goal of drug testing is to serve as a deterrent to individuals who start out using drugs in a &quot;recreational&quot; fashion but who might end up using them more and more to the point of addiction.  Drug testing also helps those individuals who are already having difficulty abstaining on their own to come forward and seek professional help.  When carried out properly, drug testing is a valid means by which to identify individuals who have used illicit drugs in the near past.  Depending on the drug to be identified, the individual's personal use habits, rate of metabolism, and the test cutoff level, one could detect previous drug use for periods of days or even weeks.  What a single drug test will not do, however, is identify whether the drug was used knowingly or unknowingly, the method, or the exact time of use.  This is particularly true when urine is used as the biological specimen for analysis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Laboratories involved in drug testing must operate in a strict forensic manner, since in most cases the only evidence is the specimen submitted for analysis.  Maintaining proper chain of custody throughout the testing process and proper documentation of the testing results are essential for the validity of the test.  Today, most drug testing laboratories, especially those certified under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines, abide by these requirements and provide test results which are both scientifically and legally defendable.  Under the guidelines, the testing process is delineated in such a way that specimens must be tested at least two times using two independent aliquots from the original bottle using two techniques operating by totally different principles.  One of these techniques (the confirmatory test) is mandated to be gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) which is a very &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*181]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accurate &quot;state of the art&quot; test.  Quality control procedures, both open and blind, mandated within the laboratory, coupled with external quality control carried out by the testing agency (also mandated under the guidelines), provide necessary assurances to the accuracy of the testing process.  The continuous monitoring and evaluation of the laboratories' performance through proficiency testing (six cycles per year) and on-site inspections (twice a year by DHHS) provide added assurances to the accuracy and reliability of the testing process.  Testing for drugs of abuse under DHHS guidelines is perhaps the most accurate and reliable laboratory test one can get today.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I hope the information provided above gives you my position on the issue of drug testing.  In the meantime, should you need additional information, need me to elaborate on any particular point, or discuss another area of interest to the Task force, please let me know.  I will be glad to get it done immediately to meet your schedule.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>With best regards, and good luck with your assignment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 11, 1990<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Paul Marcus, Professor of Law, The University of Arizona, Tuscon, Arizona 85721<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Professor Marcus:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is exactly one properly done study to ascertain whether pre-employment testing to detect drug users sanitizes the workplace.  Dr. David Parish when asked to implement a testing program for pre-employment applicants at an Atlanta Hospital suggested a study of pre-employment testing instead.  For six months all applicants for work at the hospital were tested.  All qualified were hired whether they tested positive or negative.  The information about the test results were kept confidential.  Most of the positive group were positive for marijuana metabolite.  All employees were carefully evaluated one year after hiring as to their suitability and work performance.  There was no evaluation differences between those testing positive and those testing negative.  More of the study group who tested negative had been fired than those testing positive.  I recently spoke with Dr. Parish who told me that a year after his study, despite his protests, pre-employment testing was instituted at the hospital because management thought it best.  This is, of course, a decision to conduct a crusade rather than an evaluation of policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urine testing of unimpaired workers for evidence of illicit drug use has become widely accepted.  When I entered the arguments and controversies in 1983-1984, I would have characterized this governmental and management-executed action as a data-free policy.  I would now in 1990 characterize testing as a data-proof policy.  Workplace-based drug testing has become less of a policy to be evaluated than a crusade.  Policies can be evaluated for what they accomplish; crusades are evaluated by the degree of righteousness we feel in conducting them.  Those conducting the crusade produce little or no credible evidence that the goals of drug testing are being achieved.  In fact, the statements indicating that drug testing works as a policy were generated in 1984, and they are simply repeated over and over in various forms today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*184]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Kleber's Letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accomplishments cited in this letter to Professor RA Smolla in June of 1990 have a familiar ring:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drug testing . . . has proven to be a deterrent to drug use by the casual user and an impetus to seek help for the addict.  Many companies use drug testing to improve safety, to deter use, to improve productivity and to reduce health benefit costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two things to say about the above quotes.  How could anyone oppose a policy which accomplished such things, and where is the documentation proving that workplace testing would accomplish them?  The answer to the latter question is: nowhere. I'll discuss briefly the technological dilemmas which remain but more importantly, nowhere is there any proof at any acceptable level that urine testing of apparently impaired workers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) has proven to be a deterrent to casual use,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) forces addicted users to seek help,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3) improved productivity,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4) reduced health benefit costs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5) augmented safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Overview of Testing in 1990</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the testing does is fairly simple conceptually.  If an individual chosen for testing provides an authentic specimen, a screening immunoassay followed by a confirmatory GC-MS may identify the reaction product (a metabolite) of an illegal drug.  Recent refinement of testing (and the narrowing of the searching) means that it is rare for a false-positive test to occur.  Most workplace positives are secondary to the identification of delta-9-THC-carboxy acid, a marijuana metabolite.  In truth, the development of the ability to detect extremely small amounts of marijuana metabolite is the essence of the entire drug-testing enterprise.  The percent positive for illegal drugs in the Federal Workplace tested heretofore is less than 1%.  Most of these are secondary to marijuana metabolite.  The reported range of all positives due to marijuana metabolite is 60-90%.  Of the remaining drugs tested for in the Federal programs (opiate, cocaine, amphetamine, and PCP) opiate positives have essentially been withdrawn from consideration.  The end result of heroin metabolism in the urine is morphine glucuronide.  This is the same resultant if the testee has consumed legal codeine or morphine or ingested poppy seeds or poppy seed products.  Although there is a test to assess a specific heroin metabolite, this is not routinely done.  Within the Federal Program, if an individual tests positive for morphine metabolite, he or she is simply exonerated by a Medical Review Officer if the test is not confirmed by clinical evidence of opiate dependence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*185]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A positive test for PCP or amphetamine is rare.  Although there is some non-dependent or recreational use of cocaine by Americans in the workplace, little is detected because the metabolite persists for such a brief period of time and most users consume off worktime and off premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on marijuana should help us think about the other claims of the benefits of testing.  There is little evidence of dysfunctional work caused by the occasional use of marijuana and despite hyperbolic claims, there is little evidence that most users of marijuana go on to particular trouble or heavy use.  For example, the most recent data of the High School Senior Survey, confirms that use is conservative.  Less than half of high school seniors have ever tried marijuana.  Of these who have ever tried, only 38% have used in the last month, and 30% of those who have ever tried have not used in the past year.  Of those who have ever tried, approximately six percent have smoked 20 of the last 30 days and constitute regular users.  Now if this is true, the rate of dysfunctional drug use (mostly potential high dosage use of marijuana) is very low in the workplace.  Therefore, the current testing simply detects at a high cost the use of marijuana and not those in need of help and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Firestone Study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kleber's statement is very familiar.  I have previously written of the repeated use of a cadence of &quot;facts&quot; about the workplace performance of drug users since 1984.  These untruths are repeated almost daily by those justifying a policy of testing and they have been accepted as a true reflection of the workplace drug problem.  Dr. Sidney Cohen, supposedly quoting a study of the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company generated this list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recreational drug user is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 4-5 times more likely to be involved in accidents on or off the job,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* will be absent or late to work or leave early more than twice as often as the non-user,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* will apply for sickness benefits 4-5 times more often than the non-user,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* will exhibit a diminished (usually 33%) productivity,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* will be involved in substantially more grievance matters and file many more worker's compensation claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. E. Gates Morgan of the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company Medical Department could not understand how the idea emerged that there was such a study and he recently told a newspaper reporter that there was no Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company study.  However, these facts with little variation have been cited by Michael Walsh who heads the NIDA Office of Workplace Initiatives in a number of declarations in lawsuits filed by Federal Unions trying to stave &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*186]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  off testing.  They are cited by Roche Biomedical in its literature promoting urine testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncritical citing of these documents is surprising.  It takes only a second to realize that since most workplace drug use is secret, and we &quot;need&quot; to test millions to learn about it, how could we know these imposing facts about recreational users?  Since they are seldom caught, how could we know that they have filed five times the number of compensation cases and are 2.2 times more likely to be absent from work?  These numbers are made up and Dr. Kleber's citing of these justifications for testing simply indicate the completeness of his new affiliation to the Czar's office as opposed to his prior affiliation to an academic ideal of skepticism, criticism, and truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents of testing who move beyond the repetition of fraudulent Firestone data will often cite the Postal Study.  Although this actually exists, it does not make the case for testing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Postal Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Postal Service decided to conduct an evaluation of pre-employment testing.  Preliminary reports of the study indicate that a slightly higher percentage of those testing positive had been fired than those testing negative (15.4% versus 10.5%).  The study simply has no validity and was improperly designed.  Almost all the positives were significantly younger than the negatives.  It is well established that for first hires, the retention rate of mature workers exceeds that of youthful workers.  In fact, the Post Office Study generated a positive group consisting almost exclusively of youthful Black males while the &quot;control&quot; group contains older, white applicants.  The study does not at all indicate that the 4-5% differences in retention in a youthful minority group of workers from a &quot;control&quot; group of older non-minority workers had anything to do with the positive marijuana test rate.  The positive marijuana use was associated with this group of hirees who were not retained.  One could as well postulate that some other factor predominantly associated with the youthful group caused their job loss - how about a preference for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> footwear or a greater mass of hair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compiled Testing Results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent NIDA monograph, there is a report of data generated under a California law requiring composite evaluation of results from some California laboratories engaging in drug-abuse urine testing.  The results are somewhat skewed in the direction of positives because the laboratories were reporting both screening positives and later confirmations as two separate tests.  Despite this, the incidence of positives in the workplace was very low.  To quote this article:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*187]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The first-year results, however, raise serious questions about the value of drug testing in the workplace.  When we consider that only 1 or 2 out of each 100 tests in the employee population are positive and that due to the limitations previously discussed, even those 1 or 2 positives may represent an overstatement of the actual number of positive tests in general, we have to decide whether we really need to test for drugs in employee populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aggressive repeated random testing in the workplace, or at schools, or at the Republican National Convention, may deter some casual users.  I accept that, although the proof is still lacking to confirm even this benefit.  This result would constitute preventive surveillance - exactly the sort of political solution that has been unacceptable heretofore in a constitutional democracy.  Actually, despite the enormous cost of our testing programs, they probably do not go far enough to accomplish even the goal of deterrence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug testing does not sanitize the workplace nor does it enhance productivity or safety or decrease health costs.  It stands as an expensive symbolic folly which harms individual workers and fools us.  It is drug abuse abuse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leo Wilson Jr., 16, was shot to death for his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sneakers and satin sports jacket, police say.  Police were questioning three people ages 18 to 22 in Wilson's murder, said Lt. Steven Jacobsmeyer of the homicide division.  A charge of first-degree murder against one of the three was taken under advisement Friday by the St. Louis circuit attorney's office.  Police were continuing to investigate, Jacobsmeyer said.  Wilson was shot moments after leaving his girlfriend's house shortly before midnight Monday in the 6000 block of Etzel Avenue, in the Cabanne neighborhood, police said. He was robbed of his black-and-white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes and a satin black-and-silver jacket bearing the logo of the Los Angeles Raiders, said homicide Detective Joe Nickerson.  Wilson lived nearby, in the 5800 block of Page Boulevard.  He was shot once in the abdomen and twice in the leg. He was found on a driveway on Etzel and died at 6:50 a.m. Tuesday at Barnes Hospital.  A neighbor of Wilson's girlfriend told police that she had heard what sounded like Wilson say, ''Are you all going to kill me?'' That was followed by several gunshots, the witness told police, Nickerson said.  Police say the three being questioned accosted Wilson. They were part of a group of five who had committed five other robberies between 11:30 p.m. and midnight Monday. In each case, the youths took satin pro team jackets, satin caps or tennis shoes from their victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nickerson said the three youths claimed to be part of the ''Crips'' gang.  But Lt. Thomas Malecek of the police department's juvenile division said the youths were probably gang ''wannabes.'' Teen-agers in cities along the coasts have been killed for their sports jackets or sneakers, and robberies of those items are on the increase in St.  Louis, said Malecek. Teen-agers here have been shot for their jackets or shoes, but Malecek said this was the first case he knew of in which a youth had been killed.  ''It's becoming a growing problem, because apparently these items have a lot more identity value than in the past,'' Malecek said.  Wilson's mother, Reata Wilson, said Friday that she could not believe her only son had been killed for a pair of sneakers and a jacket.  ''If they wanted it, they could have took it and let my child live,'' she said. ''He was a good child, very playful, and always kept us laughing.  We're going to miss him.'' Leo Wilson was a sophomore at Southwest High School and enjoyed weight-lifting, his mother said. Among the other survivors are two sisters: Michelle Wilson, 19, and Cher Wilson, 15.  Reata Wilson said her son had wanted to start his own carpentry business when he graduated from high school. She said he liked to work with wood.  ''We've got a lot of pieces here at the house that he made himself,'' she said.  ''I want the police to find out who did this, so that person can be punished,'' she said.  Bill Bryan of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed information for this story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOOTING A BULLET with a bullet is, in effect, what the Army's Patriot missiledoes when it kills an incoming Scud.  So far, the Patriot appears to be knocking down each Scud that has come under fire. This success stems from a mixture of high technology and luck.  Finding a defense against ballistic missiles - missiles whose flight path forms a high, inverted ''U'' at thousands of miles a hour - has become for military researchers the hunt for the Holy Grail.  For more than 40 years, the United States has invested tens of billions of dollars in trying to develop an anti-missile missile. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Zeus program of the '50s gave way to the Spartan and Sprint programs of the '60s.  The search slowed slightly after 1972, when the United States and the Soviets signed an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting each to only one anti-missile launching area.  Still, anti-missile research continued through the '70s. It exploded in the '80s under President Ronald Reagan, who launched the Strategic Defense Initiative - instantly dubbed ''Star Wars.'' Although the Patriot incorporates some of the Star Wars technology, the program itself dates back almost 30 years and is rooted in the Sam-D anti-aircraft missile of the early '60s.  At that time, the Army wanted: A replacement for its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hercules (a high-altitude anti-aircraft missile) and its Hawk, at least as its medium-altitude role.  A more self-contained missile unit, or battery, that would allow soldiers to move it more quickly around the battlefield.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most accurate missile in the world - a specification that caused big problems.  This cutting-edge-of-technology approach nearly killed the Patriot in Congress because it added billions of dollars in cost and forced a 15-year development program.  But in the end, the extra money and time let the Patriot blast Scuds from the sky.  Each Patriot battery has a radar set, a command center, an electric power plant and eight boxy ''launching stations,'' which look like large freight containers, each with four missiles. All the equipment rides on vehicles or trailers.  The core of the system is called ''phased-array'' radar - the latest radar, in which the antenna stands still while the electronic signals move in high-speed bursts.  The radar first detects the incoming Scuds, then ''tracks'' them - plots their course - and finally guides the Patriots to the Scuds. The radar performs the tasks of nine types of radar of the old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hercules and Hawk missile batteries.  The solid-fuel Patriot is 17.5 feet long and 16 inches in diameter. In theory, even a near-miss with its 200-pound fragmentation warhead will kill a Scud. But for all practical purposes, the speeds involved demand a direct hit.  The Scud is coming in at several thousand miles a hour, and the Patriot is going out at more than three times the speed of sound - about 2,200 mph at sea level.  That makes timing critical, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham of High Frontier, a private group that pushes Star Wars.  ''You've got only a couple of minutes,'' Graham said, to detect and track the Scuds and fire the Patriots. Even with their range of more than 40 miles, the Patriots destroy the Scuds only 2 to 4 seconds before the Scuds would otherwise hit.  At this point, the element of luck is critical.  Graham said the Patriot crews were improving the odds by double-teaming each Scud with two Patriot missiles.  But continued success for the Patriot depends on two critical factors: Whether the Scuds will be fired at targets within the Patriot's protective umbrella.  Whether the Scuds will be fired in limited barrages.  The Patriot has a limited ''footprint'' - the area it can defend.  ''The exact footprint is classified, so I'm not going to give you that,'' Graham said. ''But I can say the Patriot is designed to defend something the size of an airfield rather than an entire city.'' And just as the Patriot's area is limited, so is its ability to cope with mass waves of missiles.  Although the radar is said to be able to track 100 targets at a time, Graham warned that the number that can be actually shot at is limited.  ''Each battery has eight launchers with four missiles each, so that's 16 targets,'' Graham said, assuming two Patriots for each Scud.  Before the war, the Army had four Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia. Graham said he had not heard of any more being sent. But he says that given the experience of recent days, more might be.  Few people say the Patriot fulfills the promise of Star Wars. An Iraqi Scud is a far easier target than a Soviet intercontinental missile with maneuverable warheads.  But as long as Iraq keeps hitting warfare's equivalent of high pop flies, Patriot crews should continue to catch the Scuds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three National League club owners say they will not support any move by John McMullen to sell his Houston Astros to out-of-town buyers who could move the team to another city.  ''I can't see going along with that,'' Pittsburgh Pirates owner Doug Danforth told The Houston Chronicle.  Bill Giles of Philadelphia said he would not approve of moving the Astros from the Astrodome ''unless they could prove it was an extreme situation.'' Bob Lurie of San Francisco said he would not vote for such a move.  McMullen and Louis Susman, a former Cardinals official who now works for Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm retained by the Astros, met with the eight-member major league ownership committee in Santa Monica, Calif.  Meanwhile, Commissioner Fay Vincent formed a committee to study the conditions under which major-league teams would be able to transfer cities.  Vincent, who has opposed franchise moves, asked Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad to join a small group that will examine if the policy should be changed.  BASEBALL Saberhagen To Miss Start Kansas City pitcher Bret Saberhagen has tendinitis in his rotator cuff and will miss his next start, the Royals said. Saberhagen (6-3) was to start Monday in Texas. The Royals said his condition would be re-evaluated next week.  HOCKEY Jets Still On Hold The Winnipeg Jets' would-be ninth head coach in franchise history still remains with the New York Rangers. Jets general manager Mike Smith has all but confirmed that he has offered the NHL job to John Paddock, 37.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paddock, who coached the Rangers' American Hockey League affiliate in Binghamton, N.Y., last year, has not yet been given clearance by the Rangers to sign a contract.  Former Jets coach Bob Murdoch was fired after the team finished 18th out of 21 teams last season.  Lindros Bidding Stirs NHL NHL teams are lining up to try to put together a package for highly touted prospect Eric Lindros, who has said he doesn't want to play in Quebec, Hartford Whalers general manager Ed Johnston said.  Quebec has said it wants to take Lindros with the first pick, but Lindros has indicated he will skip the NHL draft on June 22 and will attend the newly formed Continental Hockey League draft on Thursday, Johnston said.  Nordiques officials said they had not heard that Lindros would skip the NHL draft or that he would attend the CHL's draft.  BASKETBALL Warriors' Richmond Arrested Golden State Warriors star Mitch Richmond was arrested on traffic violations in Manhattan, Kan., early Wednesday. Richmond, a former Kansas State star who was the NBA's rookie of the year in 1989, was arrested for traveling 43 mph in a 30 mph zone, not having a driver's license in his possession and for refusing to take a preliminary breath test, the Manhattan police said. He was released on $87 bond.  Brown Says He'll Stay With NBA San Antonio Spurs coach Larry Brown, 50, said he will remain with the National Basketball Association club, ending speculation he was headed to the University of South Carolina. Brown is entering his fourth season with the Spurs.  Daly Tells Pistons He'll Return The Detroit Pistons said Chuck Daly, their coach of eight seasons, will be back next season. Daly signed a two-year contract last summer that included an option for 1991-92. Daly, the NBA's oldest coach at 60, told general manager Jack McCloskey of his decision in an informal meeting Wednesday.  More Violations Found At Nebraska A University of Nebraska investigation of its men's team apparently has turned up new violations of NCAA rules, a school official said.  Al Papik, NU's head of compliance and academic services, said the investigation focuses on the auto loans to two players from Ray Peery, the former executive director of the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. Peery was arrested in April and charged with diverting nearly $750,000 of the compact's money for his own use.  HORSE RACING Two-Year-Old Sets Record Claiborne Farm's Lure, a 2-year-old, set a track record for 5 furlongs at Belmont Park in New York with a clocking of 56.1 seconds. Lure raced on or near the lead throughout the fourth race and won by 5 lengths.  The colt, carrying 118 pounds and ridden by Jerry Bailey, sliced three-fifths of a second off the record set by Buck's Best in 1986 and tied by Celeste Cielo in 1991.  BOWLING Devers Leads Kessler Open Scott Devers averaged 225 for six games and took the lead after three rounds of the PBA Kessler Open in Dublin, Calif. Devers, who moved up from second, has 4,072 total pins.  In second is Dave Arnold with 3,963. Parker Bohn III is third, another 14 pins back. Del Ballard Jr. climbed into fourth with a 3,932 pinfall total.  Walter Ray Williams Jr. dropped to fifth with 3,925.  FOOTBALL Court Decision Favors NFL Players A federal appeals court declined to hear an appeal by the National Football League in a dispute over restrictions on veteran free-agent players.  The NFL Players Association called the ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis a ''tremendous victory for the players.'' A U.S. District judge ruled May 24 that the league's labor exemption for restrictions on veteran free agents ended when the players association terminated its union status in 1989.  The circuit court declined to consider the appeal now, although the league could still raise the issue after trial of the underlying lawsuit, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 17.  MISCELLANEOUS AD Leaves K-State To Join </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Miller resigned as Kansas State athletic director to join </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for ''a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' K-State President Jon Wefald said.  Miller, 47, will become athletic director for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International for a six-figure salary, according to a newspaper report. A former Kansas State track coach for 21 years, Miller became athletic director in 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE MICHAEL, 11, tried on the Air Jordans his parents had promised him for basketball camp, his 8-year-old sister, Kate, fondled the little-girl-sized Reebok Pump from the display. It's her dream shoe, but at $80, her parents won't go for it.  What makes it so cool?  ''When you push the pump button,'' she explained, ''it makes you, like, run faster, or it makes you, like, jump better. It helps you do aerobics. It feels like air is floating inside of your shoe.'' Then, ''when you don't want to run real fast or jump, you press the button'' and the sneaker deflates.  How does she know all this if she's never worn a pair?  ''Everybody knows about them,'' she said, clearly appalled that I'd had to ask. ''Like, it's a popular shoe.'' One more child hornswoggled by advertising, you might think, but no.  Reebok's ads don't claim the Pump - which pumps air into bladders in the shoe's lining to create a closer fit - makes you run faster or jump higher.  Reebok's John Morgan admits right up front that it doesn't.  And he's right. Zillions, the kid version of Consumer Reports, proved it.  They heard the same run-faster, jump-higher playground myth and decided to test it out. When they outfitted their kid testers in three kinds of shoes - the Reebok Pump, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Jordan and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quantum Force - they found that the kids jumped to exactly the same heights in all three models, and actually ran a little bit slower in the Pumps, which were noticeably heavier than the other two.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the testers were told they could keep the shoes they liked best, nobody chose Pumps.  According to Morgan, those results may need updating soon. Since Reebok introduced the first Pump, he says, they've streamlined its air-pump technology. The Pump they'll introduce in August, he says, weighs only 15 ounces per shoe, more than 5 ounces lighter than the model Zillions tested.  It still won't make you run faster or jump higher. What it does do, Morgan says, is reduce ankle injuries. He says tests at the University of California at Berkeley matched 200 kids in low-tops against 200 kids in regular high-tops and 200 kids in Pumps - and found that the Pump cut ankle injuries by 60 percent.  So where'd the run-faster, jump-higher rap come from? Morgan doesn't know, but it doesn't surprise him. Kids, he says, ''have a tendency to build stories around shoes.'' For instance, a black high-t op basketball shoe Reebok happened to introduce shortly after the death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias came to be known in the Washington, D.C., area as the Len Bias Memorial Shoe. And, on New England playgrounds, the black high-top Pump that the Boston Celtics' Dee Brown wears - and that he so effectively called attention to during the NBA All Stars Slam-Dunk Contest last February by pumping and repumping before every try - is known as the Deebok.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE'S A LOOK at some of this season's hot new fitness items that could make your exercise time more enjoyable.  Body Reach. ''Not enough time'' is the oft-given excuse for not exercising.  But if you can spare 30 minutes three times a week, you can work out at home effectively with the Body Reach System ($100 to $140).  The heart of this exercise routine, which develops flexibility, strength and endurance, is the padded and weighted Body Bar that you hold as you bend, twist and step up with in a workout designed by an Olympic coach. For ordering information, call Body Reach at (718) 271-7929.  Inshore Foul Weather Jacket. There's nothing worse than trying to put in a full day of sailing and racing while getting chilled to the bone.  Patagonia's lightweight (26 ounces), waterproof Inshore Foul Weather Jacket ($200) is mesh-lined, comfortable enough to wear against bare skin and perfect for inshore or offshore sailing.  It's hip-length for greater maneuverability and lined at the waistband with gripper elastic.  The complementary Inshore Foul Weather Bib ($205, 25 ounces) has a Supplex back from mid-body to shoulders for ventilation and pre-bent knees to mimic the natural stance on a boat and to prevent chafing. For ordering information, call Patagonia at (800) 638-6464.  Air Huarache. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has found a way to provide a minimalist running shoe that's packed with extras to make your running faster and more comfortable.  The innovative Air Huarache ($110) is now the lightest training shoe on the market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">To weigh it in at just 9.5 ounces, the designers removed the traditional heel counter and replaced it with a unique strapping system borrowed from water-ski boots. You just step into the shoe, and the rear strap gently holds your heel in place. The strap not only reduces weight as it provides stability, but drastically reduces heat buildup and blistering.  For a store near you, call </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at (800) 344-6453.  BottleRocket. It's the little things that make bicycling so rewarding, like reaching down for a water bottle and being able to get a big gulp without getting splashed, or worse, have the water come dribbling out of the spout when you squeeze.  The completely leakproof BottleRocket ($11.95, 22 ounces) from Giro Sport Design solves these problems. The over-sized container has a no-slip rubber strip around the middle and a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning. It also has an indexed spout with two flow rates, and it comes in three interchangeable parts and enough colors to make 64 different combinations.  For a store in your area, call Giro at (800) 969-4476.  Prolite Shield. Sunglasses are an essential piece of outdoor athletic gear, but there's nothing more annoying than going for a spike in volleyball or grunting your way up a steep hill on your bike and having to push your glasses back up the bridge of your nose.  The Prolite Shield ($20) from Smith Sport Optics solves this problem by eliminating the temple pieces altogether from the Lexan glasses and replacing them with a snap-on terry-cloth headband. This not only keeps sweat from dripping in your eyes but holds the glasses snugly to your head. Call Smith at (208) 726-4477 for the deal er nearest you.  Individual Trainer. Reaching fitness goals is too often a hit-or-miss proposition for most people, so Leap Inc. of Eugene, Ore., created the Individual Trainer ($379, 1 1/2 pounds), an exciting hand-held computer that will design an effective individualized exercise program.  Simply enter your answers to questions about your exercise history, fitness goals and personal characteristics, and the computer comes up with a customized workout. For more information, call Leap at (800) 695-3353.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIANAPOLIS - Stars surround Richard Keene. This is his chance to see if he belongs.  And maybe, in a way, he doesn't. Not in this setting, at least.  The setting is the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABCD Basketball Camp. ABCD stands for Academic Betterment and Career Development, and the camp's devotion of about five hours each day to preparing the 120 high school campers for the academic side of college life makes it unique among summer basketball camps.  That and the fact that those 120 campers come by invitation only. They're regarded as the top high school players in the nation.  On paper, Keene fits right in. He will be a senior at Collinsville High, which has a rich basketball tradition. He stands 6 feet 5 but plays with guard skills, has started for three seasons, has led his team in scoring for two seasons. He hits the 3-pointer with regularity and is a better passer than shooter.  Among senior off-guards, Keene is ranked No. 17 in the nation.  No question that he merited the invitation to the ninth annual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp, which was moved to Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis this year after developing its reputation at Princeton University. The atmosphere is first-class: every player a major-college prospect, almost every face in the stands one of a major-college coach.  They haven't seen Keene at his best.  ''I talked to a lot of the coaches recruiting me before I came here,'' Keene said. ''They told me a little of what this would be like.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They just said, 'You won't get the ball much. So don't get frustrated by that.' '' The players were divided into 12 teams of 10 players each. They play two games a day, with each playing about 21 minutes in each game. Keene usually was on the floor with Rasheed Wallace, a 6-10 center from Philadelphia; Otis Hill, a 6-8 power forward from Pleasantville (N.Y.) High; Danta Bright, a 6-6 forward from Baltimore's Dunbar High; and Kiwame Garris, a 6-1 point guard from Westinghouse High in Chicago.  Often, Keene would be standing wide open on the wing while one of his ''teammates'' stood with the ball on the other side, guarded to the point of suffocation; yet still that player would pump up a shot, which often was jammed back in his face, or would drive to the basket and shovel the ball upward through a sea of arms.  On the rare occasion when Keene would touch the ball, he might make an impressive pass - he had five assists in his first game. Or he might shoot.  But shooting twice every five minutes doesn't give Keene the chance to show how hot a scoring hand he can have.  ''I just can't get a rhythm going,'' Keene said. ''Really, I'm just playing defense and hoping for the best. All I can do is try as hard as I can with whatever I'm able to do. There's not a whole lot of attention to team play out there, though.'' Keene wouldn't mind impressing some of those coaches in the stands, though it's not exceedingly necessary. He already is busy listening to the likes of Bobby Knight, Dale Brown, Lou Henson, Roy Williams and Jim Harrick.  Mike Krzyzewski, head coach of national champ Duke, was in the stands; the coaches can't discuss recruits, but a peek at Krzyzewski's camp roster showed he had Keene's name marked in yellow highlighter.  Keene hopes to leave Indianapolis with his top-20 standing among off-guards intact because he'd like to have a chance to play in some of next spring's all-star games.  ''Those rankings are nice, but it's not really that important to me,'' Keene said. ''I'd like to be up there as high as I can be, sure. But I'm looking to get to college.'' He will get to college, and he won't have to thumb for his ride, either.  That is safe no matter how he plays at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp.  No, Keene isn't quite as concerned with the on-court education he is gaining in Indy as he is in the off-court lessons. The longer he is in the camp, the more self-assured he becomes that he will be able to play big-time college basketball and will be able to handle the academics side of that life.  ''It feels good to be here with all of these players,'' Keene said. ''The first night before we played here, I was a little nervous. I've never really been in a situation like this before.'' Keene's name has been listed among the best for about eight months. But his abilities hadn't been measured alongside so many others with similar abilities until this week. He was supposed to play in some top camps last summer, then had to sit out because of a broken wrist.  Suddenly, after an outstanding junior season, he is the focus of tremendous recruiting attention.  ''The great thing about being here is that I know that I'm not the only one going through it,'' Keene said. ''I've got such a big decision I'm going to have to make, and now I'm getting to talk to a whole bunch of other guys that are making the same decision as me. It really is helping out.  ''It's kind of funny, but I'm ranked 17th at my position and my roommate up here for the week is ranked 18th. We're talking a lot.'' Keene's roommate is Dante Calabria, from Beaver Falls, Pa. He is a fraction of an inch shorter than Keene. They found they shared more in common than their position and hit it off from the start.  ''It kind of feels like I'm meeting guys I'll be seeing for a long time in the future,'' Keene said. ''I'm sure I'll play against some of the other guys here when we all get into college.'' He also will know much more about college life than he would have otherwise. Keene recently found out he passed the testing requirement under Proposition 48 eligibility guidelines, so the test preparations aren't something he needs anymore. But the other hours of the day have been beneficial, he said.  ''It's fun, but not too much fun,'' Keene said. ''I'm not having a bad time. The fun part is when I'm out there playing. The rest of it, it's kind of like school. That's something you have to do in order to be able to play the basketball part.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How come baseball coaches wear baseball caps but football coaches don't wear football helmets?  A: Because football helmets are equipment, good only for playing football, while baseball caps are clothing, and can be worn virtually anywhere by anybody.  The equipment/clothing distinction is more fluid than you might think. For instance, D'Artagnan's sword was equipment, but what about the swords that are part of the dress uniforms of men - whether Knights of Columbus or Army officers - who never use them and may not even know how? These non-fencers' swords are elements of costume, just like their epaulettes and brass buttons.  Until 10 years ago, hiking boots were equipment; now most of them are clothes. One result: Hiking boot sales have tripled.  A couple of weeks ago I tried on a 5-pound pair of serious-equipment-type hiking boots, the kind designed for people who feel obliged to climb tall mountains just because they're there. They felt like a couple of concrete blocks strapped to my feet - and not for nothing. You need that rigidity, the salesman explained, if you want to put on some crampons and walk straight up an iced-over waterfall or traverse a glacier.  Of course, most people who want to get out into the outdoors and have fun have something less ambitious in mind, like a 3- or 4-mile hike with the family. Or just something different, like trail-running or a hell-for-leather ride on a mountain bike. Something you could almost do in sneakers, except that this is a culture that's managed to convince 12-year-olds that they need $125 basketball shoes to ride the school bus, so nobody has to tell these hikers and bikers and trail-runners that they need special shoes, shoes that at least look like equipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't need the full steel shanks and stiff leather of waterfall-walkers, and they won't put up with the weight, or put in the month or two it takes to break a pair in.  And they don't have to. Lightweight, instantly comfortable hiking boots were first introduced 10 years ago; Hi-Tec's Sierra Lite and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lava Dome were among the first.  ''We basically made our running shoes more rugged,'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Craig Duerr says.  There's still some arguing about whether the lightweights were designed to meet the needs of casual hikers - or just to create a new market niche athletic shoe companies could fill.  Whichever, lightweight hikers were a big success. Art Kenyon of Vasque, an old-line hiking boot manufacturer, estimates that today, the lightweights account for 60 percent to 65 percent of the market.  According to a survey by the National Sporting Goods Association, sales of hiking boots nearly tripled over the past five years - though hiking increased by only 30 percent. What this must mean is that lots of the people who buy hiking boots aren't hiking in them.  Tom Doyle, spokesman for the association, says that ''about 60 percent of athletic shoes are never used for their intended purpose.'' But, when most hiking boots weighed 5 pounds and took weeks to break in, hardly anybody bought them to mow the lawn in. (Though, in the late 1960s, people who'd bought them for mountaineering sometimes wore them to English class as a badge of outdoorsy cool.) The lightweights, Kenyon says, are more ''multiuse'' - in other words, they're clothes, not equipment. He says people wear them ''to watch the kids play football, mow the grass, clean out the garage,'' and landscapers wear them as work boots because they're ''not too dorky'' to wear after work.  Now lightweight hikers are mutating again to produce a new shoe category designed for what the manufacturers call ''outdoor cross-training.'' Outdoor cross-trainers, clearly inspired by the success of the geographically non-specific cross-trainers that hit the market a couple of years ago, are designed for trail-running, mountain-biking and hiking.  You might not think those three activities would attract enough people to sustain a whole shoe category, and you'd probably be right. But Dave Getchell, Backpacker Magazine's equipment editor, points out that, though only a limited number of people actually hike, run trails and ride mountain bikes, lots more like the idea and may want ''to identify with these nice green activities'' by wearing the shoes, ''just the way people who live in the suburbs drive Jeep Cherokees and kids who don't play basketball wear Air Jordans.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK. What are the best-selling athletic shoes of the moment?  You'd be right if you said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (particularly ones in the Air series, as in Air Jordan basketball shoes and Bo Jackson cross-trainers), Reebok (the Pump series is hot, Blacktop and otherwise) and L.A. Gear (especially for little kids).  And don't forget good, old Keds.  While everybody and their teen-aged brother has been buying $100-plus, status sports shoes, Keds have been steadily sneaking out of the stores.  For the last 75 years, Keds has been cranking out canvas sneakers with blue labels on the heels and surviving all the trends.  Mark Waldman, president of Lauries Shoes, which just opened the nation's first Keds store in Chesterfield Mall, said that when status tennis shoes were in, ''Keds kept selling.  ''Then it was running shoes . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then it was aerobic shoes . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then cross-trainers . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then cute little styles from L.A. Gear. . . .'' And, well, you get the idea. Keds sold 20 million pairs last year alone, giving it a 5.1 percent piece of the $5.3 billion athletic footwear market.  Not too shabby for a humble sneaker that can be traced back to Charles Goodyear's discovery in the 1800s of the vulanization process that enabled manufacturers to use heat to meld rubber to cloth.  At the turn of the century, the rubber footwear divisions of the U.S.  Rubber Co. were turning out shoes under 30 different brand names.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the company decided in 1916 to consolidate the shoes under one name, it originally settled on ''Peds,'' from the Latin word for foot. That trademark was held by other firms, so Peds became Keds, and the rest. . . .  Well, you know.  ''We've had this store for 40 years,'' said Waldman of his family's first shoe store situated in Glendale, ''and Keds have always been strong because Keds are just Keds. They're classics.  ''Right now, Keds is probably feeling one of the biggest explosions (in sales) it has had in many, many years.'' One important reason for that, Waldman said, is because the basic, canvas shoe - the Champion Oxford - sells for only $26 at full retail.  ''They sell like crazy because of the price,'' he said.  A spokeswoman for Footlocker, which has several locations in St. Louis, said Air Jordans (priced at $80 to $130) and Bo Jackson crosstrainers ($110) are ''flying out of the stores.'' The same is reported by a spokesman for Athlete's Foot stores, who adds to the list Reebok's Boulevards, from the ''Blacktop'' series. ''But,'' he added, ''we're doing very well with some of our special sale shoes,'' which are not the high-profile, high-priced shoes, but basic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air cross-trainers or shoes from the Reebok ''Classics'' line priced in the $45 to $60 range.  Phil Landes, general manager for the Omni sporting goods stores here, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok are ''beginning to feel some price resistence'' from customers because of the cost of the high-profile shoes.  ''Once the price starts going over $70,'' Landes said, ''parents start going, 'Whoa.' '' By spring, he continued, ''you'll b e seeing more basic athletic shoes and more plain white shoes'' from the big manufacturers at prices less likely to make a parent's heart stop.  Pretty much what Keds has known all along.  Women and teen-aged girls account for about 50 percent of the Keds sales for Lauries, and Waldman said that both price and a return to more feminine clothing styles have caused many women to abandon the chunkier athletic shoes for the softer-looking Keds.  Then there's a matter of comfort. ''Every shoe company is finding that the comfort shoe is here to stay,'' Waldman said by way of explaining the popularity of Keds and Keds' 18-month-old line called Essentials.  Keds describes Essentials as ''lifestyle'' shoes. Waldman elaborated a bit, saying the shoes are made by combining ''rubber, comfort bottoms with neat tops.'' Included in this group are suede chukka boots that come in a range of colors, skimmers with a variety leather, suede or metallic tops, and leather oxfords. Prices rarely exceed $40 for any Keds shoe.  Gordon Edwards, regional sales manager for Keds, said that until about a year and a half ago, the East Coast and the South had been the best markets for Keds, but that the company's fastest growth these days is in the Midwest.  ''Right now,'' he continued, ''we're on fire in St. Louis. Famous and Dillard's can't get enough shoes.'' And they're selling well at J.C. Penney and Sears stores, and at the many other shoes stores that offer Keds.  What's different about the new Lauries Keds store in is that it offers every style and size of men's, women's and children's shoes made by Keds - including hard to fit. The women's basic, canvas oxford, for example, will be available in 18 colors and patterns for spring. This includes the plain, white canvas oxford, which is available in more than 150 sizes.  When Waldman and his brother, Scott, proposed the idea of opening the store, Edwards said, ''It was a natural because of what Lauries has done in the children's business, and because you're dealing with two companies that have been in business a long time.'' The Chesterfield location, Edwards continued, was a natural, too, ''because there are kids all over West County.'' Keds worked with the Waldmans on the concept for the store and the design, which includes a bright, blue neon Keds logo over the entrance. So far, Waldman said, sales have exceeded original expectations.  That's something executives at Keds headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., are watching closely.  ''If this continues to be successful,'' said Keds spokeswoman Joy Pratt, ''we absolutely will consider doing the same thing with other stores in other cities. We've already been approached by people in a couple of other markets.'' Pratt attributes the early success of the Chesterfield store partly to Keds' price and quality.  ''It's a brand people grew up with and are going back to,'' she said.  ''Keds fit right in with this whole '90s, back-to-basics attitude.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's fascination with fitness is muscling up business for sporting goods dealers, officials in the industry say.  And its adulation of athletes is pumping up demand for athletic shoes and clothing. Sales have been rising like a 400-foot homer, with a downward curve not yet in sight.  ''People want to stay fit, and sports is an easy and fun way to do it,'' said editor Steve Fechter of The Sporting Goods Dealer, published here.  Celebrity athletes underline the fun in their paid endorsements. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.  has Bo Jackson, a star in two sports, dancing in an ad for cross-trainers and Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls dunking a basketball to plug Air Jordans.  The hoopla, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other companies hope, will send some of the masses out to play or, at least, get them to dress for play. With every convert, retailers gain potential sales of specialty shoes, gear and clothing.  Sporting goods sales in those three categories reached nearly $30 billion last year, up about 4 percent over the previous year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, based in Mount Prospect, Ill.  Baby boomers in their 40s are finally realizing that they are not invincible, said Larry Weindruch, a spokesman for the association.  ''They've started to take care of their bodies.'' At the same time, many of the boomers' children - even non-athletic ones - are pressing their parents to spend chunks of the back-to-school budget on highly advertised athletic shoes like high-tops and Pumps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales of athletic shoes got really hot in the early 1980s when walking around in this brand or that ''became cool,'' Weindruch said.  Among the companies that have capitalized on this fever is Woolworth Corp.'s Foot Locker, a rapidly growing chain that sel ls athletic shoes and clothing.  Foot Locker topped a survey by Sports Trend of the 100 biggest sporting goods retailers. Sports Trend, a trade publication, estimated Foot Locker's sales last year to be $975 million at nearly 1,300 stores, 14 in this area.  A sister division - Lady Foot Locker - gathered more than $250 million in sales, Sports Trend estimated. A new concept, Kids Foot Locker, is gaining a following in the younger set.  The founding of Foot Locker dates to 1975, but other chains have sprung up more recently to cash in on the spell sports seem to cast.  Sports Authority, which entered the St. Louis market this summer with three stores, started in 1987 with just one outlet. By the end of this year, it expects to have 36.  The chain picked St. Louis as one of its early locations because ''we think it's a growing community,'' said President Jack Smith in an interview last month. ''St. Louis has always been a major-league city.'' Chris Schwartz, president of MC Sporting Goods Inc., agrees. Retailers find a ''very sports-minded enthusiast in St. Louis,'' he said.  Businesses have lined up to cater to this crowd. The Yellow Pages here list more than 100 retailers in the sporting goods category, and those listings omit discount and department stores, which also are major players.  Kmart Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., J.C. Penney Co. and Target all rank in the top 10 in Sports Trend's annual survey of sporting goods sales.  Yet competition for sporting goods sales in St. Louis ''is not any worse than we find in other cities,'' said Schwartz, speaking from his headquarters in Grand Rapids, Mich.  Schwartz opened 10 MC Sporting Goods stores here last month (transformed from Gart Brothers/Casey's Sports Stores). MC bought a group of 20 Gart stores earlier this year.  Although the number of sporting goods stores nationwide is growing, the rate of growth is not that fast, said Weindruch of the National Sporting Goods Association. The bigger story, he said, is that these stores seem to be owned by fewer companies.  For example, a company called Thrifty Corp., based in Los Angeles, is the parent of three major sporting goods chains - Gart, MC, and Big 5 Sporting Goods, based in California.  And Kmart Corp. sold more than $1 billion worth of sporting goods last year if you count the $100 million contribution from The Sports Authority, one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sports Trend estimates.  ''Big companies are getting bigger at the expense of some of the smaller, independent sporting goods retailers,'' Weindruch said.  To compete, independent retailers are using ''niche marketing,'' Weindruch said. They take one or two things they're best at and ''try to be awfully good at that and really not concern themselves with things they aren't so strong in,'' he said.  Three brothers - John, Bob and Rick McArthur - have one niche in St. Louis with their four stores called Johnny Mac's Sporting Goods, in business for more than 25 years.  Selling goods to teams and schools makes up half the company's business, said Bob McArthur, general manager. The company gets its name across by sponsoring more than 100 baseball, softball and soccer teams a year, McArthur said.  Inside the store, Johnny Mac concentrates on products for team sports, plus services like sharpening skates and relacing baseball gloves.  Some of its main competition in St. Louis comes from mass merchants that sell the goods but don't offer the services, McArthur said.  Sportsprint Inc., another company with a focus on team equipment and sportswear, has five locations here.  It finds a second niche in producing licensed sportswear, handling ''all the graphics from start to finish,'' said Ralph F. Rockamann Jr., president.  The company is licensed with most colleges and universities, he said.  Licensed products are the sole focus of Superstars, also based in St.  Louis.  Founded in 1988, the company expanded outside this area and now has 27 stores in 11 states. Five of the stores are in malls in this area.  Tom Noblitt, president, said the company sells anything with a team name on it - from jerseys to waste baskets to barbecue grills.  Sales of licensed sporting goods continue to excel. Last year, they rose by 5 percent to about $2 billion, said Karen Raugust of the Licensing Letter, a trade publication.  With figures like that in mind, Superstars plans to expand aggressively.  Noblitt said three more stores might open by the end of the year. He qualified his plans by saying the company would be watching the economy.  But he may not need to, according to Weindruch of the National Sporting Goods Association.  The sporting goods industry grows even in periods of recession, Weindruch said. ''We outperformed virtually all retail categories'' in the recession of 1981 and 1982, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the unsavory types you would not want around your children. If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware upon their departure.  So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting five-figure contracts to try to sell you on what deodorant you should put under your arms?  Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside and threw water on another fan last season.  The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive steroid test.  So why would Gillette, the maker of Right Guard, spend money on these guys?  ''We are playing off their bad boy image,'' says a spokesperson for N.W.  Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. ''It's the way the campaign is supposed to work.'' ''Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,'' says Gary Wichard, Bosworth's agent.  So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.  ''To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,'' says David Falk, vice-chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host of athletes. ''But I've got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.  But what are the bounds? ''You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,'' says Bob Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San Francisco. ''With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.'' Dorfman points to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe commercial that ran after Barkley had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial, David Robinson, the clean-imaged center for the San Antonio Spurs and another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorser, asks Barkley, ''Can you spell fine, Charles?'' Still, there is a line.  ''For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of (Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving charge,'' Dorfman says.  Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi Berra said, ''Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who'' back in the 1950s. And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday Night Fights.  Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.  And while Sabatini and Steffi Gr af, both tennis players, rank among the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is largely a man's game in the United States.  ''Tennis and golf both have international appeal,'' says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an identity consulting firm. ''But in the U.S. the hottest market right now are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.  ''In the wider U.S. market, women (athletes have a much more limited appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just because Monica Seles wears the same kind.'' So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the salaries their teams pay them.  Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is paying Jordan a reported $19 million over 10 years to try and get people to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract went unrevealed but advertising executives suspect it was the single largest endorsement deal ever.  All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at $10 to $15 million yearly. His salary is $2.1 million annually.  ''Michael transcends everything,'' says Chajet. ''His image has redefined marketing.'' Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $5 million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.  Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image is of common man perfection.  ''It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a sought-after endorser,'' says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. ''There has got to be personality and a sense of acceptance of the person.'' Despite the limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco.  Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation for multiple traffic offenses. And after being a no-show at numerous public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could hear his side of the story.  Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.  ''Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,'' Dorfman says. ''He's scary. You have to have some pleasantness about you.'' A lack of ''pleasantness'' has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988 Pepsi agreed to pay him about $1 million to push its products, but the contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.  ''There are only so many dollars out there for the credible athletes,'' says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former Brave Dale Murphy.  ''The involvement costs are too high to gamble with. The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message out in front of the public.'' ''It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a star, there is some degree of risk,'' Chajet says.  To most, the line is distinct: Lawbreakers are taboo.  ''On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,'' says Lanktree. ''Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to be all right.'' Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records after testing positive.  Though Johnson did not have a many lucrative endorsement contracts, the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international possibilities for him, Lanktree says.  ''Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,'' she says. ''What he did was not illegal, but he totally lost all his value (as a spokesperson.  ''He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult, unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality cinched it.'' Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.  She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.  ''Whatever Boggs's attitudes was, he was not seen by the people of Boston as s aying, 'I don't care what you think,' '' she says. ''On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think that was very significant.'' Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing products.  ''The Jordan deal was monstrous,'' says Dorfman. ''How much Gatorade will people have to drink for that much money to pay for itself? But I think what it says is that advertisers think the market is bottomless.'' ''More and more,'' says Lanktree, ''I don't know that there is a limit.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE ARE SOME tips on how to make sure your athletic shoes fit properly: (REST) Have both feet fitted while you are standing up.  Make sure there is about a quarter-inch, about half a thumb, between the end of your longest toe and the end of the shoe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heel area should be snug with no slip. The heel should appear square when viewed from the rear. A tapered heel invites instability.  Pay particular attention to the width of the shoe. It should not be too snug, or feel sloppy.  Check the arch area for fit. Is the arch high enough? Too high?  Experienced fitters will check for pronation (foot rolls inward) and supination (foot rolls outward). Suggested for pronation are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Anodyne and Asex Gel Epirus. Suggested for supinators are the Skylon model by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Saucony Azura.  Check for personal comfort. Some runners, for instance, like cushioning shoes. Others prefer to feel the ground. Athletic shoes are available that are designed to fit every customer's preference.  Ask about and try air-system fits. Also try less-expensive fits. Only you can decide which is best.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted Dipple, president of Woburn, Mass.-based American Specialty Underwriters, says premiums for the new policies can cost 1% to 3% of the total revenues involved. Payoffs come if an athlete-endorser is involved in the ''commission of a criminal act, offense against public taste or decency, an occurrence tending to degrade, scorn or ridicule a large section of the community.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The ad, for new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes called Air 180, will star triathlete Mark Allen. ... Fans will be able to hear the race track's public address announcer at the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix in Anaheim, Calif., Saturday, thanks to a limited range radio signal that fans can pick up on transistor radios. ... The government of the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent has put out an official NFL licensed product: 25,000 postage stamps meant to commemorate this year's Super Bowl. One set of the new stamps will picture action shots from previous Super Bowls.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> BALTIC-BALL: A sports footnote to the current Soviet crackdown in the Baltic Republic of Lithuania: the ambitions of Enrico Kesayev of Vilnius, Lithuania. In a letter to The Wall Street Journal's Brussels bureau, Kesayev says he asked sports officials in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to help start a league for U.S.-style football. But ''nobody would bother with us as there were no stadiums with artificial covering, no sports costumes, no economic base.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Kesayev says he could locate only six balls and no rule books in the Baltic republics, he started a team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal could be announced as early as today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White Sox have scheduled a 10 a.m. EST news conference in Sarasota, Fla., their spring training headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There will be doctors on the scene who will have good news about his condition,'' said Dolan, whose company prominently displays Jackson in multimillion-dollar shoe ads. ''It seems he'll be back sooner than expected.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kansas City Royals, convinced that a football hip injury had put Jackson's baseball career in jeopardy, released him two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White Sox apparently agree with Jackson's doctor, who has suggested that Jackson might be able to play baseball as early as mid-July. The contract is likely to reflect a sharing of the risk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These days, when you see ads starring Leslie Nielsen, Paula Abdul, Isiah Thomas or Michael Jordan, you're seeing double. And triple. And even more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those celebrities are part of an increasingly popular though highly controversial trend: Stars are being signed by a variety of national marketers to appear in two, three or more ad campaigns at once.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Nielsen, for instance. The actor's career got a new lease on life in the 1980s after he turned to comedy. His ad career is reborn, too. In funny TV commercials, he plays off his riotous shtick as a deadpan doctor in Airplane! and as an off-the-mark police officer in The Naked Gun and a sequel opening June 28, The Naked Gun II 1.2: The Smell of Fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nielsen's first ad work, for Coors Light beer, has been airing since 1989. In January, he appeared as a clueless detective in ads for Diet Coke's ''Crack the code'' contest. And last week, Nielsen returned to the Tarmac in new ads for Dollar Rent A Car Systems Inc. themed, ''Right on the money. Right on the airport.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Nielsen is ahead of multi-endorser Abdul, who is appearing in national ads for Diet Coke and L.A. Gear.Nielsen is close behind multi- endorser Thomas, who is featured in national ads for MTV, Minute Maid Orange Soda, Toyota and ASICS Corp. athletic shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Nielsen has a long way to go to match the Chicago Bulls' Jordan. The basketball superstar now pitches for an astonishingly long list of blue- chip national marketers. Among them: McDonald's Corp., Coca-Cola Co., General Motors Corp. (Chevrolet), General Mills Inc. (Wheaties), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., Sara Lee Corp. (Hanes) and CBS/Fox Video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple endorsements are lucrative for celebrities. Generally, a major marketer can pay anywhere from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 to lure a star into its ads. Other considerations can send the fees even higher: if the deal runs for several years or if the marketer wants the celebrity to make personal appearances at trade shows or dealer meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet few issues in advertising raise the hackles of industry critics more than the phenomenon of multi-endorser stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critics see red when the same short list of famous faces appears in ad after ad after ad. In recent years, that list has included Bill Cosby, Bo Jackson, John Madden and Willard Scott. Among newer additions: rock star Little Richard (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taco Bell) and rap star M.C. Hammer (Pepsi-Cola, Taco Bell and British Knights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main complaint is that multiple exposure ''confuses the hell out of people,'' says George Lois, chairman of the Lois/GGK ad agency. The reason: The more ads a celebrity does, the less likely a consumer might be to recall the product being pitched in any one ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus, there's a danger that multiple ads will ''make (the star) more famous than the product,'' Lois says. He should know - he admits that ''I like to think I use celebrities more than anyone in the history of advertising.'' Among Lois' star-filled campaigns are ads for Reebok Pump athletic shoes, MTV and USA TODAY featuring celebs like Scott, Boomer Esiason and Tip O'Neill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who stars in more than four simultaneous national campaigns has ''reached the saturation point. It begins to be a negative,'' says David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a clearinghouse for sports talent. ''I do see (advertisers) pulling back on some of these people who have that many commercials.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet those involved in signing celebrities to appear in multiple ad campaigns - as well as those who advise the celebrities to sign - say the practice is unavoidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are a lot of celebrities. There are not a lot of Michael Jordans. There are not a lot of Leslie Nielsens,'' says Dan Fox, executive vice president of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, the ad agency that recommended signing Nielsen for the delightfully silly Coors Light campaign. As long as Nielsen's new Dollar Rent A Car ads ''use him to his best advantage, they will do nothing to diminish Leslie Nielsen'' as a Coors Light ad property, Fox says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers and agencies insist using multi-endorsers is smart business. As evidence, they cite the extensive consumer research they do whenever considering whether to associate themselves with a star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ten years ago, endorsements may have been signed (with stars) because a top-level manager was a fan,'' says John Caponigro, president of Sports Management Network and the attorney for Detroit Pistons star Thomas. ''That doesn't happen anymore. Today, all the figuring out whether the celebrity appeals to the target audience is key.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dollar's ad agency tested the idea of Nielsen as an ad star. The results: ''We found him instantly recognizable by the broad target group that rents cars,'' says Ray Roschmann, executive vice president of AC&amp;R Advertising Inc. ''And his persona, his type of humor, was very much a positive influence on the communication value of the commercial.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crucial factor is ''the right use of the celebrity,'' says Manny Perez, executive vice president of the Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. ad agency. ''It works if he's there for a reason.'' Perez is using Magic Johnson in new ads for Kentucky Fried Chicken's skinless Light 'n Crispy line. The KFC ads follow the Los Angeles Lakers star's appearances in campaigns for other products such as Slice Mandarin Orange soft drinks and Converse athletic shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, marketers and their agencies are sensitive to charges that using multi-endorsers reveals them to be copycats trying to duplicate someone else's celebrity success story - and fraidy-cats, fearful of taking a chance on signing a celebrity who isn't already hawking other products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So steps are being taken to minimize the problems associated with multi- endorsers. Sometimes, star endorsers must agree to exclusivity clauses in their contracts, guaranteeing they will not peddle more products in other ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most common of these clauses call for what's known as category exclusivity. They require the star to agree to appear in ads for only one product type. For example, a fast-food chain might insist that its spokesstar not sign to do ads for a convenience-store chain that also sells food to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nielsen's case, the strategy is to avoid having him appear in any ad as a spokesman or pitchstar. ''He's not saying, 'Go to Dollar Rent A Car' or 'Drink Coors Light,' '' says Curry Walls, president of the Sutter/Walls Associates talent agency and Nielsen's agent for ad endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the idea is for Nielsen to play a character in his ads. Those advertisers who don't agree - and there have been many, Walls says - get turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Caponigro's criterion in signing ad agreements for Thomas is not the quantity, but the quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You want to make sure, as he delivers the message, that it's consistent with his personality and his image,'' he says. ''As long as you do that, everything's all right.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lynn Jennings missed $ 25,000 by three seconds Sunday - and was able to smile about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When you set a world record, how can you be disappointed?'' Jennings said. ''I don't race for money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennings outran 3,000 others to win the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's Race 8K (4.97 miles) at Washington, D.C., in 25: 02, one second better than Grete Waitz's world record, five seconds better than Jennings' U.S. record and 12 seconds ahead of runner-up Susan Sirma of Kenya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Jennings, who earned $ 5,000 in prize money and about $ 4,000 in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bonuses, broken 25 minutes, she would have received $ 25,000 from Clairol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I came here to win the race, not for any other reason,'' said Jennings, 30, two-time defending world cross-country champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I had no idea we were so close to 25. When I saw the 2-mile split (10: 10), I thought the record was out the window. I hope Clairol puts up the money next year. Maybe not, I came so close.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennings credited Sirma, who races all distances all over the world, with an assist for the record in mid-70 degree temperatures. Sirma, 24, who won a 10K in Indonesia last month and raced a half-marathon in London last week, held a seven-second lead at 3 miles, ahead of a pack that included Jennings and defending champion Judi St. Hilaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I thought Judi would go after her at three,'' said Jennings. ''When she didn't, I said, 'I'm outta here.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 3 1/2 miles, Jennings caught Sirma, who surged repeatedly until Jennings passed her in the final 200 meters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Jennings wants to peak for the 10,000 meters at the World Track &amp; Field Championships in August, she has been racing sparingly. ''I'm fit, but not race-sharp, so this (record) is heartening news,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said her coach, John Babington: ''I think Lynn is going to run</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Call it the sports world's equivalent of a Michael Jackson-Madonna showdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lakers' Magic Johnson and Bulls' Michael Jordan aren't just playing for an NBA title. They're also vying for consumer dollars. How they fare in a face-to-face marketing matchup:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Sneakers. Although financially troubled Converse is the NBA's - and Magic's - official shoe, Jordan's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it has locked up sneaker ad time on NBC for the Finals. Plus, filmmaker Spike Lee is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> teammate. ''I like Magic,'' Lee has said, ''but (Johnson's Converse) ads suck.'' Advantage Jordan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Clothes. Jordan has a line of formalwear - with casual clothes to come. But Johnson is spokesman for NBA Authentic gear, and his new NBA T-shirt line is already the sixth-biggest seller of league apparel - so Johnson even makes money on T-shirts with Jordan's likeness. Advantage Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Food. Both have blue-chippers - but Johnson owns a piece of a Pepsi bottling company. (FYI: Pepsi also owns Johnson endorsee KFC.) Jordan has a gum. But Johnson made a fast break into foreign food - a Spanish meat packer. Advantage Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Video. Johnson has a video game and home video. Jordan has a video game and two home videos, with his second approaching the record for sports videos. Jordan, along with Wayne Gretzky and Bo Jackson, will be in an NBC cartoon show, ProStars, this fall. Advantage Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible future tiebreakers: Being the first to get a major movie role, buying a pro sports franchise or replacing Johnny Carson on the Tonight show. Or maybe just one of the two superstars vastly outplaying the other on the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Dorfman of the ad agency Foot, Cone &amp; Belding, which just finished a report on NBA endorsers, Dribbling for Dollars, is ready to call it a draw: ''Jordan doesn't need a championship. Like Magic, he's set for life. It would just let him charge more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lakers center Vlade Divac, says Dorfman, might have ad dollars hanging in the balance: ''His blowing kisses to the crowd could be the biggest thing since the 'Ickey Shuffle.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vangie Hayes, who has cast many top athletes for ad agency J. Walter Thompson, suggests the biggest Johnson-Jordan ad deal is yet to come. ''They may get overexposed,'' she says, ''but it would be great if a financial organization would pay the astronomical price to use them together.'' The pairing is logical: ''They're both such money machines.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The big money matchup<BR>Never mind the on-court duel, here's how the two NBA superstars match up in the endorsement game:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spotlight is on him and Magic Johnson when Chicago and L.A. play tonight (9 EDT) and Sunday (7 p.m. EDT) in the NBA finals, tied at 1-1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jordan owns the airwaves, ad-wise. During both game broadcasts on NBC he shares his spots with:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Spike Lee for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The New York Philharmonic's first violinist for Coke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The NBA's ''official sandwich'' for McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even NBC will use Jordan in plugs for its interview with him on Saturday's Inside Stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson has an ad stable of his own, including Pepsi, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Converse and official NBA T-shirts - which lets him pocket profits from Michael Jordan T-shirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi also asked Johnson to give the ''Pepsi Summer Chill Out hand gesture'' after a dunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, is hardly miffed by TV's Michael Mania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magic gets top billing on this week's Sports Illustrated cover - with a Pepsi ad spread inside - and likely matches Jordan's $ 10 million-plus off- court annual income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've had 20 legitimate offers this week,'' says Rosen. ''But playing comes first.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now anyway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Starting Monday, about 90,000 sporting goods retailers and manufacturers will congregate in Chicago to ask each other how new contraptions work, what consumers will want this fall and whether the recession is really over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ron Williams will ask very different questions at the National Sporting Goods Association trade show: How often does the industry hire blacks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This industry, for whatever reason, has locked out blacks,'' says Williams, a San Antonio salesman for Wilson Sporting Goods and chairman of the Los Angeles-based Associaton of Black Sporting Goods Professionals. ''But we want to get away from hypotheses and get some data. I don't think anybody has done that - or been interested in the answers.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At next week's show, Williams will begin to canvass major manufacturers, thanks in part to a $ 15,000 grant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is skipping the Chicago show. The ABSGP already has enlisted a research firm and drawn on the federal government's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Among the EEOC findings: Of managers in the sports equipment segment - excluding shoes and apparel - 2.28% are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's ironic, says Williams, given the industry's diverse consumer base - and could bring pressure from outside the business. A recent boycott of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Operation PUSH, a Chicago advocacy group, was largely ineffective. Now, says Williams, the industry can act before it's scrutizined by a group with a ''bigger magnifying glass.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams hopes the industry sees his group as ''a team player,'' and he's already getting cooperation. But he says the group will forge ahead no matter what: ''We mean business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SHOW: While the public isn't allowed to peruse next week's NSGA show, it will be on the mind of everybody inside. Is the USA ready for the Rump Pump? Innovative Bicycle Products thinks so, as it launched a bicycle pump built into the seat. Other gear rookies: Exerflex putty meant to build strength through squeezes and a Polar Heart Bra that monitors women's heart rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heartbeat of the sporting goods industry itself has held steady through the recession, claiming sales that nearly matched inflation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the continuing recession, officials are expecting big numbers at the National Sporting Goods Association World Sports Expo, which runs through Thursday at McCormick Place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sold-out show of more than 1,500 exhibitors and more than 1 million square feet of exhibition space has buyers and sellers rubbing their hands in anticipation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's Expo drew more than 88,000 attendees (the trade show is not open to the public). Association officials are hoping for at least 90,000 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we do as well as the show did last year, it'll say a lot about this industry and how we've survived recessionary times,'' said Larry Weindruch, the association's senior communications manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People seem upbeat and have money to spend. They want to look around a day or so before they start sitting down to order. With 250,000 products out there, they want to see what's out there before they start spending their money,'' said Weindruch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competitors should see additional orders with the conspicuous absences of three major manufacturers: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (No. 1 in footwear and apparel), Prince (tennis equipment) and Wilson Sporting Goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is absent so it can re-evaluate its trade-show schedule. Wilson is re- evaluating its marketing program, and Prince did not make its reasons known to the NSGA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are in negotiations,'' says Coke spokesman Bob Bertini, ''but we haven't announced a deal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PGA Tour spokesman Sid Wilson said Wednesday that ''we've been in negotiations, even through today. We're very close.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine also suggests that a Coke sponsorship might be at a level approaching RJR Nabisco's PGA Tour sponsorship, which ended in 1990 with its reported $ 8 million contract buyout, although it's unlikely a Coke deal would be of that magnitude.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> POLE-ISH JOKE: The prodigious record-breaking of Soviet pole-vaulter Sergei Bubka, says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman Liz Dolan, has ''become something of a joke here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bubka has broken the pole- vault record eight times in the last year, albeit by small increments each time. Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pays standard incentive bonuses for each mark.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You're a pro athlete who knows your opponents' strengths and weaknesses from top to bottom. But do you know where you owe taxes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a question that's getting harder to answer, says Barry Klarberg, director of the sports and entertainment division of Deloitte and Touche, an accounting firm that works with many pro athletes. Already, he says, New York, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and the cities of Cleveland and Detroit are levying income taxes on visiting pro athletes, either for the number of days or games played in their jurisdiction. Some states already collect those taxes by automatic withholding.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klarberg says more states are getting into the act, as many as 15 in the next couple of years. ''It's a no-brainer for the states,'' he says, ''they just sit back and collect the money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players get credits in their home states, though that won't help athletes from states such as Florida, which has no income tax. And things could be worse, tax-wise, for athletes with U.S. teams: They could play on a pro team in Canada. There, the top tax rate is 42%, compared with the USA's 31%.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> RECOMMENDED READING: The Business of Professional Sports, a new book published by the University of Illinois Press, contains 13 essays on topics ranging from NFL players' salaries to ABC's Monday Night Football. Among the conclusions offered: Black NBA players earn about 20% less than white players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Staudohar, the California State-Hayward business professor who co- edited the book with Scottish educator James Mangan, says the academic literature on sports business is ''a little thin,'' but getting better. ''When you add it up, it isn't that big (compared to other businesses.) It's more of a mom-and-pop thing - but has disproportionate impact on society.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Staudohar's suggestion for the next sports business hot topic: ''What happens if TV turns off the money spigot?''<BR>&nbsp;<BR> THEY DID IT: With a $ 114.4 million profit in the quarter ending Aug. 31, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chairman Philip Knight says it is the first sports gear company to produce a profit of more than $ 100 million in a single quarter. ... Baltimore, one of 11 cities submitting bids for an NFL expansion franchise that could begin play in 1994, might have a bidder ready to pay cash for a team. According to The (Baltimore) Sun, Malcolm Glazer, owner of First Allied Corp., is prepared to pay cash - even if the price is $ 150 million-$ 200 million. ... Salt Lake City-based Optronics Ltd. is trying to market its Par T Golf simulator, which can project images of about 950 golf courses onto a screen. Once golfers hit balls toward the screen, a computer estimates where the ball would land, allowing players to simulate playing the course. All you need is about 500 available square feet - and $ 28,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ESPN tried an interesting experiment last Sunday night: value-added NFL game coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, don't adjust your sets this Sunday night. ESPN will continue the experiment during its Los Angeles Rams-Seattle game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is simple: Give viewers a reason to stick with a blowout. With the Buffalo Bills leading the Indianapolis Colts 28-0 Sunday, ESPN devoted most of the third quarter to a pre-arranged interview, conducted by game announcers Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann, with ex-Chicago Bear Walter Payton, who was live from Chicago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that ESPN jettisoned the game. Although it occasionally devoted the full screen to Payton, he was seen mainly in a small portion of a split screen that featured game action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This worked because we looked at it as an enhancement to the telecast,'' says ESPN vice president John Wildhack, ''I didn't think it was an intrusion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently not. Sunday, ESPN plans to try again: By satellite, Atlanta coach Jerry Glanville and Detroit coach Wayne Fontes will be guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? It will be a busy holiday weekend, and the game doesn't have playoff implications. And ESPN's 7.4 Sunday rating - putting its season- average 9.4 rating 14% lower than 1990 - can't be considered a conclusive lab test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions to mixing banging helmets with talking heads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- ''I don't think what I saw (on ESPN Sunday) was unpalatable to viewers or to us,'' says the NFL's Val Pinchbeck. ''But, personally, it's very difficult to watch a game unless the game picture is of substantial size.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Veteran NFL producer Mike Burks wonders if the format might distract announcers or prove annoying to diehard fans watching their hometown teams. ''Philosophically speaking, I think there's a great place for Walter Payton,'' he says. ''But I have a problem with it while a game's going on. ... Events needs to be treated with sanctity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- ''It's very, very important to keep viewers watching,'' says Grey Advertising's Jon Mandel. ''If it works, more power to ESPN. If not, they should try something else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- ''I enjoyed ESPN's cablecast,'' says NBC rookie NFL analyst Beasley Reece. But Reece says he won't need a sideshow when he announces Indianapolis- Tampa Bay Sunday. ''They're evenly matched. ... And anybody watching will either have a specific interest in the game or his TV set is broken and he can only get NBC.''<BR>&nbsp;<BR>CBS determines more of Olympics staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to settle all those office pools: CBS has named its announcers for the bobsled, luge, ski jumping and Nordic combined in the upcoming Winter Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesley Visser and Sean McDonough, who have both covered the NFL and college basketball for the network, are among the more easily recognizable names. But some relative unknowns will get a chance. Luge analyst John Fee, for instance, is an ex-Olympian ready for his first TV job: Fee operates a salmon fishing business near Kodiak, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or consider bobsled analyst John Morgan of Lake Placid, N.Y., who has covered previous Olympics for ABC. Morgan grew up in a family with six brothers and four sisters - and each was a bobsledder. Morgan's brother, Jimmy, a 1976 Olympian, died in a freak bobsled crash. ''Very few people,'' he says, ''can say they've seen as many sleds come down the track.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, not many people have the chance, because Lake Placid, N.Y., has the only bobsled track in the USA. Morgan suggests the USA's men's two-man team could finish in fifth to seventh place, with the four-man team placing as high as ninth. Team prospects would have been better, he says, if Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses, NFL player Willie Gault and ex-NFL player Greg Harrell had been allowed to compete - an issue that the trio is still contesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's a viewer bonus: At the Olympics, 28 cameras will be used on bobsledding, double the number in 1988.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Parcells might be out of hospital today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC says NFL studio analyst Bill Parcells is expected to be released today from Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. Monday, Parcells had a heart angioplasty. NBC says it's still uncertain if Parcells will be back on-air this weekend. ... ABC's Raiders-Saints Monday Night Football game got a season-high 19 rating, bring MNF's season average to 16.8 - on pace with 1990 ratings. ... For the first time this season, HBO's Inside the NFL is anchored in two cities - Dallas and Atlanta. Producer Dave Harmon says a joint interview with Atlanta Falcons Deion Sanders and Tim McKyer is a ''mouth of the South segment of all time.'' ... Seattle Mariners owner Jeff Smulyan is at least 90 days away from being paid for all-sports radio WFAN-AM in New York, which he wants to sell to Infinity Broadcasting for $ 70 million. Both sides agreed to the deal Monday, but either can back out until the Federal Communications Commission approves the sale. ... TNT on-air promotions showing Magic Johnson were discontinued after he retired. If you see them, it's because your cable operator isn't using Turner's substitutes. ... </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised its showcase Super Bowl ad would star Michael Jordan with ''an icon of the 20th century.'' Presumably to build suspense, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't be more specific. But Adweek's Marketing Week, a trade magazine, says it has identified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> icon: Bugs Bunny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT since Gussie Moran's lace pants outraged the purists and offended the establishment in 1949 has fashion been so prominent a topic of debate on the pre-Wimbledon hustings. Forget about the tennis, what will Andre Agassi wear on centre court or court 12 or wherever he makes his long-awaited return to the All England Club later this month? Will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his tailors, who have produced some unappetising blancmanges in recent months, risk the ultimate penalty of disqualification by being too colourful for the liking of the All England committee and the tournament referee, Alan Mills?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi, of course, is keeping quiet, which is not a word you can use about the purple and black outfit he has been sporting at the French Open. ''You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,'' he said yesterday. Besides, he is exclusively contracted to reveal all to the readers of a tabloid newspaper. At the centre of the brouhaha is rule 8 of Wimbledon's ''Conditions of entry and participation'', which states: ''For all matches (except for the warm-up period) ... competitors must be dressed predominantly in white throughout. Any competitor dressed in a manner deemed unsuitable by the committee will be liable to be defaulted''. John McEnroe, one of the more notable victims of rule 8, had to change his dark blue shorts on centre court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can quite remember when the rule was actually set in stone, but Wimbledon is the only one of the four grand slam tournaments to have such a strict dress code. Philippe Chatrier, president of the French Tennis Federation and the International Tennis Federation, has talked wistfully about adopting the ''predominantly white'' rule for the French Open notably, in the aftermath of Agassi's pink-and-white number last year but has bowed to pressures of commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manufacturers involved in the multi-million-pound leisurewear market are less enthusiastic about the tradition of the ''predominantly white'' ruling. ''What is ''predominantly white?'' asks Alfred Schwarz, head of sports promotions for adidas, who have Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf among the 50 or so players under contract. ''It's left to people's discretion. For the Wimbledon committee, that means nearly 100 per cent white, for us it means 51 per cent. We all agree you can't have solid blue, but a white background with some colour on it what's wrong with that?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Italian clothing company, Diadora, which had guaranteed Jennifer Capriati $3.5 million for a five-year contract, badly misinterpreted the ruling and had its Capriati range turned down by the Committee of Management just before her Wimbledon debut last year. As Capriati, at the age of 14, was the youngest player ever to appear at Wimbledon and the media phenomenon of the year, that was a costly error, upsetting the trade, which had stocked up with the Capriati range on the understanding she would be wearing it at Wimbledon, and the public, who could not buy what they saw on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You want to be able to make stuff you can sell,'' Ian Hamilton, of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said. ''One of the problems is that ''predominantly white'' does not sell and we can't keep producing clothes we cannot sell in the shops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the manufacturers submit their designs to Wimbledon for informal approval, but the underlying issue, according to Schwarz, is that the Wimbledon committee is overstepping the boundaries of its authority. ''The ruling makes us nervous because we have to guess when we produce our ranges what will be acceptable to Wimbledon, but it is very difficult to get all the manufacturers together to lobby for a more precise definition,'' he said. ''From an image point of view, Wimbledon is the most watched event of any through the year. It has a certain meaning, but the design rule is a problem, and we feel that is our domain, not Wimbledon's''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wimbledon argues that it is its job to protect the traditions of the championships. ''The rule is ill-defined, but we don't think it's right to stipulate any percentage for ''predominantly white''. A very small amount of psychedelic colouring can be off-putting while a pastel-coloured shirt could be perfectly acceptable. We feel and, I think, the players feel too that this is one of our better traditions,'' Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, of course, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knows a good marketing ploy when it sees one. The company will not reveal how much it has spent on the design and promotion of its No.1 clothes horse any more than it will reveal the colours of his outfit to the Wimbledon committee. Rumours abound. Agassi in classical white from top of his head to the bottom of his white bicycle shorts? Agassi with dyed white hair? The suspense is killing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right off the bat, I feel that I should say there have been times when I wondered what Bud Collins was doing on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the time he interviewed Billie Jean King after one of her many victories at Wimbledon and dubbed her &quot;St. Billie Jean of Centre Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was classic Collins, fawning humor that too often makes him seem like more of a fan than a journalist. But that weakness is also Collins's strength. He loves tennis and that love shows through on his work with NBC at major events like the French Open and Wimbledon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Collins joins Dick Enberg in the broadcast booth for today's women's final between Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini (9 a.m., NBC, CTV, RDS), he will be working on his 20th Wimbledon final. He was relegated to the minor role of roving reporter at last year's tournament when NBC wanted to give more time to broadcasting neophyte Jimmy Connors. NBC brought Collins back into the booth this year because they felt that presentation was better with him and his encyclopedic knowledge of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not an opinion shared by everyone. A few months after Collins took over as editor of World Tennis magazine, a poll conducted by the magazine showed that 40 per cent of the respondents felt Collins was the worst commentator on TV. With typical good humor, Collins said he hoped that there weren't many NBC executives in that group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins has played tennis all his life and was good enough to win a U.S. national indoor mixed doubles title - &quot;I had a good partner,&quot; he explained. While working as a sports writer at the Boston Globe, he moonlighted as the tennis coach at Brandeis University. His captain was Abbie Hoffman, who made headlines in another type of court when he was one of the defendants in the Chicago 7 which grew out of anti-Vietnam War protests during the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Collins who first broached the idea of &quot;Breakfast at Wimbledon&quot; by insisting that the event was important enough to be televised live. If you miss some sleep this weekend to catch the action, Collins is the guy to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first year (1979) was nearly a disaster,&quot; recalled Collins. &quot;We were hoping for (Bjorn) Borg against (John) McEnroe or (Jimmy) Connors and instead we got Borg against Roscoe Tanner. But it turned out to be a great match and nobody thinks about not doing the final live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Collins has become a familiar figure at Wimbledon and he can usually count on exchanging a few words with royalty. But his first encounter with the royals was a near disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignorant of protocol which calls for a member of the royal family to initiate a conversation, Collins once pushed a miscrophone in front of the Duchess of Kent. He was politely, but firmly, pushed away by Wimbledon security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Duchess saw Collins the following year, they exchanged nods and the year after that, the Duchess said: &quot;Nice to see you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she said, &quot;Nice to see you again&quot; the next year, Collins related the incident on TV and said with a suggestive wag of his eyebrows: &quot;Things are heating up, I think the Duke is getting worried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">NIKE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO UNVEIL NEW SPOT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baseball's annual All-Star game is at the SkyDome Tuesday night and the highlight of the telecast (8 p.m., CBS, CTV, Quatre- Saisons) is certain to be the return of Bo Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, he won't be playing in the outfield. But the two-sport star will be showing some nifty moves in the latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial, a splashy musical number with a chorus line and a full orchestra. In the middle of the commercial, Jackson excuses himself and says he doesn't have time for this nonsense because he has to rehabilitate his injured hip. That's when the king of the comebacks, heavyweight boxer George Foreman, steps in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future commercials will offer other pretenders to Bo's throne, including Wayne Gretzky of the L.A. Kings. In a promotional video to announce the new commercials, Gretzky says he has no desire to further his acting career. After seeing the Great One in a soap, as the host of Saturday Night Live and now in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercial, he's well advised to keep his night job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LATE BREAKING NEWS FROM CBC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBC has made a last-minute change in its SportsWeekend package today (3 p.m., CBC) and will be offering what it describes as the &quot;controversial&quot; Mike Tyson-Razor Ruddock heavyweight fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having seen last week's bout between the two, I can assure you there's nothing controversial about the fight. All the controversy was in the first fight, which was prematurely stopped by referee Richard Steele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rematch proved that Ruddock could go the distance with the once-invincible Tyson but there was never any question that Tyson was the easy winner, even after having points deducted for low blows and punches delivered after the bell had ended a round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fight fans are advised to tune in shortly before 6 p.m. to catch the action. The first three hours of the show will be devoted to World Volleyball League action between Canada and Brazil and a preview of tomorrow's Queen's Plate thoroughbred race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY'S TV HIGHLIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Baseball: Is there more woe in store for the Expos as they meet the division-leading Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh? (7 p.m., Radio-Canada).</SPAN></P>

Also on tap is the second round of the Kroger Classic Senior PGA event from Cincinnati (2 p.m., RDS, TSN) and a celebrity golf tournament from Lake Tahoe (4 p.m., NBC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cycling: The Tour de France gets under way in earnest tomorrow but there will be three previews of the classic race (4:30 p.m., ABC; 6 p.m., TSN; and 10:30 p.m., RDS). TSN and RDS, incidentally, will present daily reports on the race. ABC's Wide World of Sports will also offer coverage of the Bislett Games track and field meet from Oslo, Norway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tennis: If Wimbledon doesn't sate your appetite for tennis, there's semi-final action from the Canadian satellite circuit masters event from Sillery (1:30 p.m., Radio-Canada). Sebastien Lareau of Boucherville will meet Miguel Merz in the feature match.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drop your tennis whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional court wear is being shoved aside for the wildest tennis fashions in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say hello to bright neons and bold jewel tones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifteen years ago, whites were white but that's no longer the case,&quot; said Charles Zimmerman, customer service supervisor for Adidas Canada.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennis wear is now anything but predictable. Traditional tennis skirts now come with lycra shorts sewn inside. Or forget the skirt. Lycra shorts are hip alone or under white tennis shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or ditch the white shorts. Tennis shorts now come in an array of denim. There's washed denim, distressed denim in black, and various hues of blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bland tennis shirts have had an image boost. Many come with zippers and in neon patterns. Narrow cuts have been loosened up and some shirts comewith a tail at the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest swing has been the shift away from white. Industry leaders like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have added Persian violet, clear turquoise, hot lime and neon teal to their summer collections. Fall pushes the swing further with tennis blacks holding centre court, said Ruth Heaven, national apparel manager for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a move to the extreme since black has never been on the court before,&quot; said Heaven. &quot;Black has always been the number one body color and outsells all other colors. It's a easy sell because it's practical and you can mix it into other things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The break from bland has a lot to do with American tennis sensation Andre Agassi. The fashion- forward dynamo is revolutionizing tennis wear with hispenchant for flash, says Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sixth-ranked player created a stir at Wimbledon this year when he showed up in white. Long known for his untraditional tennis garb, sports commentators were predicting he'd break tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his long, dyed-blond hair, earring and funky tennis wear in bright color like lime, Agassi is turning a staid game on its ear, said Dan Orman of Freeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players, whose own fashions tend to mirror their favorite stars, have been snapping up offbeat wear which often comes in matching shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our zipper front tennis shirt has been one of our biggest sellers,&quot; said Heaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Younger players love the look of Agassi-inspired tennis wear, said Heaven.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEY ARE the unsavory types you would not want around your children. If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware upon their departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting five-figure contracts to try to sell you on what deodorant you should put under your arms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside and threw water on another fan last season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive steroid test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why would Gillette, the maker of Right Guard, spend money on these guys?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are playing off their bad boy image,&quot; says a spokesperson for N.W. Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. &quot;It's the way the campaign is supposed to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,&quot; says Gary Wichard, Bosworth's agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,&quot; says David Falk, vice-chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host of athletes, including the Atlanta Hawks' Dominique Wilkins. &quot;But I've got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what are the bounds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,&quot; says Bob Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San Francisco. &quot;With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorfman points to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe commercial that ran after Barkley had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial, David Robinson, the clean-imaged centre for the San Antonio Spurs and another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorser, asks Barkley, &quot;Can you spell fine, Charles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is a line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of (Philadelphia Phillies outfielder) Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving charge,&quot; Dorfman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi Berra said, &quot;Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who&quot; back in the 1950s. And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday Night Fights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Sabatini and Steffi Graf, both tennis players, rank among the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is largely a man's game in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tennis and golf both have international appeal,&quot; says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an identity consulting firm. &quot;But in the U.S. the hottest market right now are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wider U.S. market, women (athletes) have a much more limited appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just because Monica Seles wears the same kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the salaries their teams pay them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is paying Jordan a reported $ 19 million over 10 years to try and get people to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract went undisclosed but advertising executives suspect it was the single largest endorsement deal ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at $ 10 to $ 15 million yearly. His salary is $ 2.1 million annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael transcends everything,&quot; says Chajet &quot;His image has redefined marketing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $ 5 million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image is of common man perfection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a sought-after endorser,&quot; says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. &quot;There has got to be personality and a sense of acceptance of the person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DESPITE THE limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation for multiple traffic offences. And after being a no-show at numerous public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could hear his side of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,&quot; Dorfman says. &quot;He's scary . . . you have to have some pleasantness about you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of &quot;pleasantness&quot; has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988 Pepsi agreed to pay him about $ 1 million to push its products, but the contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only so many dollars out there for the credible athletes,&quot; says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former Brave Dale Murphy. &quot;The involvement costs are too high to gamble with. The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message out in front of the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a star, there is some degree of risk,&quot; Chajet says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To most, the line is distinct: Lawbreakers are taboo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,&quot; says Lanktree. &quot;Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to be all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records after testing positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Johnson did not have many lucrative endorsement contracts, the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international possibilities for him, Lanktree says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,&quot; she says. &quot;What he did was not illegal, but he totally lost all his value (as a spokesperson).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult, unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality cinched it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever Boggs's attitude was, he was not seen by the people of Boston as saying, 'Screw you. I don't care what you think,' &quot; she says. &quot;On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think that was very significant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing products.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Variety is the spice of life, and art in Vancouver this year was a visual smorgasbord of mammoth proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My regular beat covers 40 galleries. Just over half of them are public institutions and centres run by artists or non-profit associations. The rest are commercial galleries with strong exhibition programs. Between them, they staged over 500 exhibitions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a while, you become familiar with the orientation of particular galleries and know, in general, what the fare will be. It becomes rather like deciding where to dine out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-standing commercial galleries present work by their major artists every year. This means you can count on learning what Jack Shadbolt, Gordon Smith, Al Neil, Toni Onley and Attila Richard Lukacs have been up to on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can also expect work by major Canadian and international contemporaries at almost all the public urban and suburban galleries and art by lesser-known or emerging artists at the Pitt, Smash, Grunt and Fifty-Six. Shows of a scholarly nature, on the other hand, are most likely to be displayed at the Vancouver Art Gallery and at the museums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with restaurants, the art at some places is invariably better prepared and more exciting than at others. And, in some instances, the fact that the exhibition menu will vary (or hasn't settled into a pattern yet) makes for continued interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's always the element of the unexpected (a surprise, a thing of outstanding quality) that keeps the juices running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the current climate of recession and increasing competition for ever-decreasing funding, it's impossible not to admire the commitment and professionalism of the multitude of people who help make Vancouver one of Canada's most vital art centres - the equivalent to a fine buffet in a sophisticated restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are my top picks of 1991:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curator of the Year: Liane Davison, Surrey Art Gallery (13750 88th Avenue), for staging exhibitions characterized by intelligence and heart that make going to Surrey an essential trip for all who take contemporary art seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They ranged from Ian Thomas' moving presentation of the diminished world of aging parents in Swallow Meadows rest home last February to Alan Storey's current 10-year retrospective that includes beautifully crafted models of his major public installations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community-involving conceptual art show, The Presence of Absence, was the first of its kind in B.C. The entire gallery staff helped 100 volunteers create and install artworks according to the instructions of 13 international artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entrepreneurs of the Year: lithographers Torrey Groening and Nigel Harrison, for encouraging major local artists to create fine art prints with them at Prior Editions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Biden's colorful biomorphic abstractions, Carel Moiseiwitsch's phallic bombers and her current tribute to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Samothrace, Neil Wedman's neo-Victorian fantasies and David Ostrem's pop politics are themes explored in the lithographic suites these artists made and showed in the attractive atelier-cum-gallery at 1028 Hamilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Architect of the Year: Paul Merrick, for his exquisite Canadian Craft Museum at Cathedral Place and the stone-arched cloister courtyard in front of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Burrard Street perspective, the museum appears to hover above the rushing cascades of Park Place Plaza. Its pinnacled, reliquary-like form is an ornate counterbalance to the dour late 19th-century church next to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the Canadian Craft Museum's exhibition program is establishing Vancouver ever more firmly on the map as a major art and craft centre is another reason for choosing the institution as one of 1991's best things. At the moment, Finnish artist Oiva Toikka's glass is there for your viewing pleasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these were by no means all that were praiseworthy this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At North Vancouver's Presentation House, director/curator Karen Love and assistant curator Diane Evans staged a fine cycle of exhibitions of contemporary art photography, always thoroughly researched and sensitively presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Richmond Art Gallery gets a doff of the hat for sustaining its exhibition program in temporary premises - an old supermarket shared with the library at 5951 No. Three Road - until a new building opens next fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Tetrault's Island Processions (until Jan. 6) is typical of the small, intensive displays of new work by B.C. artists that are central to the gallery's program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Other outstanding exhibitions in 1991: Carole Itter, Luke Blackstone and Al Neil's Where the Streets Are Paved With Gold; Past/Future/Tense and Sara Diamond's Paternity (all at the Vancouver Art Gallery); Philippe Raphanel's Lip Synch and Recent Work (Or and Tech Galleries); Annette Messager (Contemporary Art Gallery and Presentation House); The Masque of the Red Death installation (Grunt Gallery); Michelle Normoyle's Hero (Artspeak); Kelly Wood's Lurch (The Front); Neo-Nativists (The Pitt); George Rammell (Charles H. Scott); Correy Wyngaarden's multi-media installation (University of B.C. Fine Arts Gallery); Public Domain (Contemporary Art Gallery); and Robin Peck (Burnaby Art Gallery).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial galleries also contributed immensely to the flavor of the past year's art feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane Farris recently expanded her already important stable by adding fresh local talents - Chris Woods, Lionel Doucette, Gu Xiong and Sam Lam among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Doheny's gallery recently embraced Carrol Pantages, Margaret Bootsma and Melissa Crenshaw. Rich Neilson, Wayne Edmondson, Lesley Finlayson and the current exhibitor, Lorne Greenberg, are four new names at Catriona Jeffries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Smash and Gallery Fifty-Six also staged challenging programs and introduced the Vancouver public to many new faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heffel Gallery's recent show and catalogue of W.P. Weston's work contributed to public awareness of a major (and neglected) B.C. painter. The Smash's ManWoman 20-year retrospective was the first major survey of this Cranbrook artist's oeuvre in Vancouver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Equinox's XX Century Photography exhibition offered an outstanding selection of photographic images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More often than in 1990, in fact, shows at the commercial galleries have been of museum quality or of scholarly interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOLLYWOOD</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOLLYWOOD _ Last year, Will Smith was just this charming, wise-acre kid from Philadelphia who'd had a couple of rap hits and seemed like promising grist for TV's celebrity mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Fresh Prince of Bell Air is a solid hit, the network executives have learned why Smith's teachers in West Philly dubbed him &quot;The Prince.&quot; Will Smith, six-foot-2, 198 pounds and as slick as the slash on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sneaker, plays grist for no one's mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While admitting he was overawed by the medium at first, the 22-year-old star now speaks articulately about how he wants the show to develop, where he is taking his career, and how to deal with network politics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith's perspective is fresh off the Philadelphia pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For him, the behind-the-scenes machinations of television _ what he calls &quot;posse politics&quot; _ is like a pick-up basketball game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you watch television, you feel like it's this great monster, that there's a million geniuses at work putting this incredible project together.  And then I found out when I got into the business everyone's not a genius; they just understand what's going on,&quot; Smith said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you come on a show, you want to bring your friends, It's posse politics.  On the basketball court, if you want to play ball, you want to play with your friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same things you would go through, the same arguments and everything on the basketball court to make sure you're friends play with you, that's the same things you do in the meetings when you argue about whose going to be the writers, whose going to be the stage directors and all that stuff.  And I just thought, I know how to do this!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes he does.  His girlfriend from Philadelphia works in wardrobe for the show.  A buddy from back home with no previous experience is one of the writers on the series.  Smith's personal manager is an associate producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got my squad going on,&quot; he says with satisfaction.  He admits it's nice to have their support, but their presence means much more than that.  It says he's a player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's just as determined about other aspects of his career.  He has his eye on films, but he's already ruled out comedies.  He has declined lucrative endorsement offers from Coke, Pepsi, Cannon, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, because it might undermine his film chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditto, animation.  There will, he promises, be no Fresh Prince cartoon show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith doesn't see himself as just a rapper, or even a rapper with a hit TV show.  He started his own record production company this summer; he wants to get into stand-up comedy (he had his debut recently in a Salute to Michael Jordan, as tribute taped for U.S.  cable TV); he wants to write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to have a lot of slashes after my name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He got a taste of dramatic acting this summer with a small part in a yet-to-be-released feature film called Where The Day Takes You.  Smith plays a wheelchair-bound double-amputee in a story about homeless kids on Hollywood Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his chief concern is still the series.  He's excited by changes that he says will give the characters more credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to get a feeling that life is going on, that these people are not just showing up and making jokes.  You have to feel like before 8 o'clock you missed something and after 8:30 you're mad because they're about to say something else that was just as funny but you're missing it because you're only allowed to step into your lives between 8 and 8:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a network sitcom, reality only goes so far.  He speaks, with some regret, about a potentially controversial storyline that was rejected for the coming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an episode pitched where a girl told me she was pregnant, and the episode was about me deciding what is the right thing...  I think that's very realistic because at the point that episode came on, there would be half a million kids struggling with the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith hopes that such shows will be possible in the future, once the producers have time to develop the characters.  He has strong feeling about the facets of his character that have been left unexplored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(He) is extremely heterosexual, He needs to explore those issues.  This is character whose definitely having sex.  He's 17, and he's definitely having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out that in the coming season even squeaky clean boy genius Doogie Howser over on ABC is getting intimate on screen.  &quot;Before me, man!&quot; he says with mock offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main stylemonger pitchmen -- Michael Jordan and Andre Agassi -- are going in opposite directions. (No, I didn't forget Bo Jackson. But at the moment all Bo knows is surgery. Just Glue It.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan is soaring up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agassi is choking up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seemed like a pivotal year for both men. At 28, Jordan was approaching the peak of his power. If he didn't win an NBA title with this solid supporting cast, folks would start wondering whether he ever would.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 21, Agassi was still a few years away from his zenith. But historically, the great tennis players bag a Grand Slam early. Bjorn Borg took the French at 18, and the first of his five Wimbledons at 20. John McEnroe won the U.S. Open at 20. Jimmy Connors harvested Wimbledon at 21. Many of Agassi's peers grabbed Grand Slams at tender ages: Boris Becker was a wunderkind, 17, when he claimed his first Wimbledon; Stefan Edberg won the Australian at 19; star-crossed Mats Wilander, who has since dropped off the face of the earth, took the French and the Australian at 18. Tennis isn't a patient game. It isn't fine wine aging in oak barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks like Jordan's time has come. He's celebrating an electric playoff, averaging nearly 32 points and 12 assists a game in the finals. And fortunately for him, he hasn't had to beat the Lakers alone. There's always the tendency to cast Jordan as Superman, playing one against five. But in the last three games his teammates have distinguished themselves, particularly Horace Grant and John Paxson, who've shot 65 percent in the Bulls' victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan is an especially popular cultural icon, perceived as the Right Kind of Person, one of spectacular gifts and admirable humility. Though Jordan has at times elevated himself beyond his teammates -- by referring to them as &quot;my supporting cast&quot; -- he isn't begrudged. Everyone recognizes Jordan's magnificence, and roots for him. Were he not to win this championship, or in fact, any other, he wouldn't be blamed. Like Ernie Banks, Jordan would be viewed with a sympathy that would glow warmer over the years. Because Jordan, although unequalled as a stylist, is seen as having profound substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the case with the Agassi, who is perceived as the Wrong Kind of Person, one of tenuous gifts and surpassing ego. In tennis, Agassi's style is nearly as distinct as Jordan's is in basketball. But he gives the impression of disingenuousness. Look at their most famous commercials: Jordan is a foil for Spike Lee in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads, self-effacing and charming; that he would be friends with such a wanna-be as Mars Blackmon accentuates Jordan's sweet accessibility. In contrast, Agassi has that Canon commercial, where he crassly calls attention to himself, and in the ultimate declaration of a lack of substance, he vulgarly recites, &quot;Image is everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Live by the line, die by the line. At the moment, Agassi's image is worse than Byron Scott's. &quot;Never On Sunday&quot; Agassi has reached the final of his last three Grand Slam tournaments and lost them all -- the 1990 French, the 1990 U.S. Open and the 1991 French. Every time Agassi went in ranked significantly higher than his opponent, each of whom was in his first Grand Slam final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay, you may excuse Agassi's loss to aging Andres Gomez last year in Paris by pointing out it was Agassi's first time in a Grand Slam final too. You may excuse Agassi's straight-set pasting by Pete Sampras in New York by saying Sampras's big game is tailored for hard courts. But how do you excuse losing in Paris again -- on clay, Agassi's best surface -- to chippy Jim Courier, who never got into the quarters of a Grand Slam before? Typical of Agassi, he gave back a big lead, and lost in five sets. Agassi is notorious both for losing on Sunday, and losing in five. &quot;A five-setter is just about guts,&quot; Courier said afterwards. So what does that say about Agassi?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan can lay it off on his teammates. What's Agassi supposed to say, the line judge had a bad day? Agassi's a swell player, extremely entertaining, hits the ball 1,000 miles an hour, and the fans love him. But so far all he's done in tennis is make the world safe for accessories. His earrings, his outfits and his stubble have made more noise than his game. He's a pampered poodle who now has to face this annoying fact: Although Agassi is the second-highest ranked American -- but probably the best -- younger countrymen Courier, Sampras and Michael Chang all have won Grand Slams. Agassi hasn't. At this rate Jimbo's son Brett-bo will win one before Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wimbledon seems out of the question this year. Agassi has boycotted the world's No. 1 tournament since 1988, allowing people to believe this silliness that wearing all-white offends him. He has a better chance at the U.S. Open. But it's easy to imagine Agassi being shaky in the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking heart, Agassi may be able to draw a parallel to Ivan Lendl, who wore a similar choke label until he was 24. Lendl booted four Grand Slam finals in a row before breaking through in Paris in 1984. Since then he's won seven more. He and Agassi play the same kind of hard forehand game from the baseline. The difference is in temperament. Lendl became a champion when he realized the game could humble him. Once he scorned the grass at Wimbledon. Now, even though he's won the French three times, he skips it to concentrate on preparing for Wimbledon -- the one title to elude him. That kind of humility would serve Agassi well, much better than those stupid day-glo outfits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene that provided the most touching memory of the 1991 NBA Finals came a few minutes after the victorious Chicago Bulls had danced into their locker room in the Great Western Forum. In the middle of a typically raucous champagne celebration sat Michael Jordan, his arms caressing the championship trophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NBC camera was there too as Jordan, flanked by his father James and his wife Juanita, embraced the trophy the way a first-time father would his newborn child. &quot;Where's Michael? Where's Michael?&quot; the normally unflappable Bob Costas shrieked as he searched for the series MVP. By the time Costas finally found him for a quickie interview, it was almost anticlimactic. No words -- just the picture -- were necessary, shortly after midnight, when the real Michael Jordan finally appeared on national television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not the Michael Jordan of the commercial breaks who soared to the moon to grab a Coke, not the Michael Jordan pitching the worst hamburger ever made (McDonald's McLean, a fat-free piece of cardboard masquerading as chopped meat), not the Michael Jordan in the genie's magic lamp. Not even the Michael Jordan -- doyaknow, doyaknow, doyaknow -- who's not going to Disney World unless all his teammates are invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, this picture was the real deal, a magnificent athlete in solemn celebration after achieving his life's goal, a man who never again will have to hear himself compared to Ernie Banks of the Cubs, another Chicago legend who never won a championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC spent more wasted time on history to set the scene for Wednesday night's final game. They built a story line about the Bulls' teams of the early 1970s with Bobby Love, Norm Sloan and Norm Van Lier and their frustration in being eliminated in the playoffs by the Lakers for three straight years. Van Lier even showed up at halftime as NBC pounded away on the same theme -- that the Bulls of 1991 would finally vindicate those talented teams of the past. But that was then and this was now, and if you think Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen or any of the other Bulls were playing this game for anyone but themselves, think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, once the hype ended and the games began, NBC distinguished itself in its first year of NBA coverage. Marv Albert has no peer as a basketball play-by-play man, always calm, even when Dyan Cannon pecked him on the cheek at the start of the second half and wished him a happy birthday. And analyst Mike Fratello, particularly in the final two games, learned to modulate his voice from shrill to shrewd and cogent observations on strategy and game trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC did us all a favor by limiting the role of its sideline reporters, though Steve Jones hardly distinguished himself. At a critical juncture in the fourth quarter, just as the Lakers had taken a one-point lead, he pointed out the crowd was singing &quot;I Love L.A.,&quot; a kiss of death for the Lakers in games past. As it turned out, he was right, but the only sweet music that buried the Lakers was the whistling woosh of the net every time John Paxson tossed up one of his lethal long-range shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sideline reporters are useless unless they can actually provide instant updates on key injuries, changing strategies or significant trends, not the claptrap of inane interviews with players' parents and wives, Hollywood celebs, or cliche-cluttered coach interviews at halftime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC might be wise next season to steal a page from CBS's NBA coverage -- stick a microphone and a hand-held camera into huddles during timeouts to get the real story as coaches diagram plays and set their defenses. Come to think of it, though, almost every timeout during this series was immediately followed by an endless stream of ads, most of them featuring bikinis, spandex and beer in one variation or another and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. By now, there isn't a basketball fan alive who doesn't know that Commissioner Stern gives lousy birthday presents to former Naval officers. Mr. Robinson, keep the day job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stern could care less, not after he takes a look at the ratings the final series achieved. Wednesday night's game had a 19.7 rating and 36 audience share, the second highest rated NBA game in history, trailing only a 21.2 and 37 share for Game 7 between the Lakers and Pistons in the 1988 finals. It also drew the highest ratings for games 2, 3 and 5 in NBA history, and the average viewing audience of 43.6 million for each of the games also was an NBA record. As NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol said, &quot;The only disappointment is that we could only imagine where we could have gone with the sixth and seventh games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seven-game series would have added a few million more to the network's coffers, but Ebersol could take consolation in knowing that the NBA on NBC -- a $ 600 million package over four years -- turned a profit at a time when many network sports divisions are taking a recession-induced beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ratings were like the good old days,&quot; Ebersol said yesterday. The network was praying for this ballyhooed matchup of Michael Jordan vs. Magic Johnson. But Ebersol said he believed it was actually interest in Jordan's quest for his first NBA title that began building during the sweep of Detroit added to the drama and swelled the viewership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't really have a finger on it right away,&quot; he said, &quot;but as each day went by over the last three weeks, I think people saw a transcendent moment for Jordan as the Bulls began to beat the Lakers. The most visible superstar in all of American sports was reaching his goal, and the public got caught up in that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when he finally got there, NBC, much to its credit, was there to share Michael Jordan's glorious moment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyers ventured back onto Wall Street today, giving stock prices a lift amid fresh signs that the economy is rebounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.92 points to close at 2934.93. In the broader market, nearly twice as many stocks rose as fell on moderate New York Stock Exchange volume of 155.8 million shares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traders said a drop in long-term interest rates lent support to stocks and that after several weak sessions, buyers were attracted by bargain prices. But the news on the economy was the main impetus for the market's rise, many said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House declared the year-old recession was finally over, pinning its optimism on today's government reports showing personal incomes and consumer spending rose last month. And applications for jobless benefits fell in mid-June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advance in the Dow index was aided by a sharp rise in the price of Allied-Signal, a conglomerate that is one of the 30 stocks in the average. The stock rose 3 7/8 to 33 1/4 on news of a change in the company's top management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compaq Computer skidded 1 1/2 to 30. Kidder Peabody cut earnings estimates for upcoming quarters and the full year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost 1 3/8 to 35 7/8 on speculation that CBS's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was preparing a negative report on the firm. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the company is &quot;being treated very favorably&quot; in a show on executive compensation to air in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scimed Life jumped 12 3/4 to 64 after reporting higher-than-expected first-quarter results. The news prompted some analysts to raise their earnings projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of Amgen, which fell sharply two days ago, continued to rebound smartly, gaining 7 to 117 3/4. Alex. Brown repeated a strong buy recommendation on the company and raised estimates of 1992 earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interest rates declined slightly in thin trading in the credit markets. The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond slipped to 8.48 percent from 8.51 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar finished higher on world currency markets against nearly all major currencies. It rose to 1.7950 German marks, up from 1.7873 in New York, but against the yen, it closed at 137.80, down from 138.28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil prices posted big gains, largely on an afternoon rally fueled by news of a fire at the Amerada Hess Corp. refinery in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, even though the fire was not devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Light, sweet crude oil for delivery in August settled at $ 20.48 per barrel, up 40 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natural gas futures prices also showed a strong advance as they continued to rebound from record lows earlier in the week, with contracts for delivery in August settling at $ 1.182 per 1,000 cubic feet, up 4.0 cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early trading Friday in Tokyo, share prices bounced back slightly. The Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 42.64 points, or 0.18 percent, closing the morning session at 23,585.67. On Thursday, the index fell 223.35 points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A short time after winning back its status as the seat of reunited Germany's government, Berlin has welcomed the return of a powerful symbol of the country's glorious and aggressive history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the goddess of victory, her chariot and its four horses were remounted last week atop the city's Brandenburg Gate amid cheers for a return to normalcy and protests that the statue glorifies Germany's aggressive and nationalistic past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-ton, 197-year-old goddess had been removed for repairs after a rowdy New Year's Eve crowd damaged the statue a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But the goddess returns with a different look: For the first time since it was removed by East Germany's Communist government in the 1950s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holds a standard topped by an Iron Cross and the Prussian eagle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross and eagle were added to the statue in 1814 to celebrate a Prussian victory over Napoleonic France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German parliament member Friedbert Pflueger, leader of a group of young conservative legislators who had fought to keep the government in Bonn to symbolize Germany's commitment to the West, denounced the placement of the country's highest war decoration, the Iron Cross, on the gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I doubt whether we will be understood above all by the younger generation and abroad if we crown the Brandenburg Gate with this symbol,&quot; Pflueger said. &quot;The Prussian eagle and the Iron Cross can be admired in a museum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leftist Berlin daily newspaper TAZ expressed its contempt by printing a prominent photograph of the rear of one of the goddess's horses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance 90, the East German grass-roots movement that spawned anti-Communist demonstrations in 1989, called the decision to display the Iron Cross &quot;an anachronism&quot; and a sign of the &quot;Prussian-German nationalism that led the European continent more than once in the last 200 years to catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Berlin city government defended the $ 300,000 restoration and the return of the Prussian symbols, calling them a proper and proud part of German history. The director of the city museum in charge of the restoration told the Reuter news agency that &quot;history should be understood by interpreting monuments, not by destroying them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a feat of American engineering prowess, Motorola Inc.'s new 7.7-ounce MicroTAC telephone -- the smallest cellular phone ever -- is worth calling home about. Alas, as a symbol of hand-held haute media couture, it's a disconnect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although engineers may take great pride in their abilities to miniaturize, portabilize and personalize electronic media, simply shrinking circuitry is a lazy, style-empty approach to creating innovation. Motorola's engineers may be brilliant, but its designers aren't.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond a certain point, personal media such as telephones, computers and planners aren't just functional objects anymore -- they're fashionable accessories. You don't just use them -- you wear them as part of your daily media wardrobe. Our media should fit us as comfortably and stylishly as a custom-made suit or a favorite tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you ever tried to talk into one of these hand-helds? Folks who use these palm-sized cellular phones generally look like twits talking up their sleeves. The traditional notion of a &quot;phone&quot; as something you hold in your hand and speak into becomes silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much more elegant for the executive woman on the move to have a tiara-style headset that frees the hands for note taking or a cup of coffee? Men wear &quot;power&quot; ties; which style and color are tomorrow's &quot;power headsets&quot;? If Sony Corp. were designing cellular phone fashions, you could be sure the phones could be worn a' la the Walkman, not just something you carried around in your pocket. The challenge here isn't just clever engineering; it's captivating design. It's figuring out what the best design metaphor should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computers by Cardin? Interfaces by Armani? Ralph Lauren's Casual Multimedia Look for Men? Why not? Clothes blend function with fashion. So do those state-of-the-art digital watches. We should be able to wear our computers and television sets as comfortably and casually as we wear our watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe high-bandwidth antennae will be woven into our jackets and touch-sensitive panels could be stitched into our sleeves as we choose to make our media fit us instead of the other way around. The goal is not to recreate Maxwell Smart's shoe phone -- it's to offer a media wardrobe that's tailored to our media style. People already pay a premium for Waterman and Mark Cross pens -- ink-based media that offer far more fashion than function. So why wouldn't they pay a premium for a wardrobe that delivered far more bang for the buck?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the athletic shoe business. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. and Reebok International Ltd. have succeeded precisely because they've figured out how to meld the lust of fashion with the need for performance. Their shoes are loaded with &quot;innovative technologies&quot; such as pumps and gels. These companies don't make shoes; they create lifestyle technologies. Why shouldn't a telephone or a computer be designed with that idea in mind? Maybe Motorola and Sony have a lot more in common with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the high-tech shoe companies than they now realize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, nobody thinks twice at the sight of an executive in a $ 3,000 suit wearing a Sony Walkman or screaming into his or her BMW's car phone. Perhaps it will seem just as natural for someone to sketch a digital diagram on his or her IBM/Apple software sleeve to have it uploaded into an office file by cellular modem. Perhaps power Ray Bans will be equipped with the projection device made by Reflection Technologies that gives the eye the illusion that a computer screen is hovering but a foot away. Maybe Nintendo will offer a jacket-with-a-joystick that lets you play games if you slip a cartridge in your sleeve. My gosh, if we can have Coca-Cola Co. clothes, why not have a line of digitized Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. mensware that lets you resonate with the frequency spectrum or catch &quot;Casablanca&quot; as you're standing in line?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that people already have personal media woven into the fabric of their lives. How much of a leap is it to weave that technology into the fabric of their clothes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, why shouldn't the well-tailored media wardrobe -- permitting easy computational management of integrated sound, text and imagery -- become just as common as today's double-breasted suit? The folks of the future who don't wear a phone or a computer in public may seem as vulgar or poorly dressed as people who don't wear ties or whose favorite textile is polyester. Instead of &quot;All dressed up and no place to go,&quot; tomorrow's lament will be &quot;All dressed up and no data to process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's far too early to anticipate the differences between haute media couture and the off-the-rack, ready-to-wear media wardrobes that will be selling at K mart. On the other hand, it's not at all early for the Motorolas and Sonys to start chatting with the Givenchys and Ralph Laurens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, people are interested in tools and functionality. But our media are as much a reflection of our desired lifestyles as anything else. Relentlessly smaller phones miss the point. So do smaller computers and electronic planners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Motorola in the &quot;portable telephone&quot; business? Or is it really in the business of creating new fashions for personal communications? Will the Motorolas, Sonys and Matsushitas make devices we use to communicate and calculate? Or will they also design the media wardrobes we wear? My bet is that the media wardrobe companies will be those that make a real killing in the business of pop culture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE BEGINNING, there were Loehmann's, the Williamsburg Pottery Factory and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I came to Washington 15 years ago, those were the main places to shop discount. Loehmann's was open late one night a week, and never on Sunday. Friends organized killer, day-long expeditions to Williamsburg for dried flowers, loads of Pyrex and Mexican trinkets. Only the really serious joined charter bus trips to the Pennsylvania hinterlands for raincoats and lingerie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Washington seems at the epicenter of discountland, with nearby Potomac Mills crowding out Virginia's historic landmarks as the state's No. 1 tourist attraction, and roads to the beach or the mountains strewn with factory stores.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since I'm not the all-day browser type, having neither the fiscal nor physical wherewithal, I've developed a more strategic approach to ferreting out bargains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the big-name outlets -- Anne Klein, Bali-L'Eggs-Hanes, American Tourister, Carter's, Bass, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example -- have stores in each of the three main shopping areas: Potomac Mills, the Eastern Shore and Martinsburg, W. Va. It's the shops unique to each locale that determine the direction I head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My biggest weakness is for china. I think it must be in the genes, since both my sisters are similarly afflicted. All of us can always find just a little more shelf space for, say, a dozen dinner plates, or another pair of candlesticks. So, all things being equal, I head east on Route 50 where Mikasa, Royal Doulton, Dansk, Carvel Hall and Gorham all beckon with bargains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This trip can be tedious at best during summer months, when everyone is rushing at breakneck speed toward Rehoboth and Ocean City. But the pace is more relaxed in the off-season, and all the new road construction is finally paying off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First is Mikasa (in the Bay Bridge Market Place, one mile west of the Bay Bridge), a cavernous showroom packed with shimmering crystal goblets, deeply etched crystal bowls, formal china, frivolous crockery, beer mugs, chip-and-dip servers and massive Italian pottery. It's almost too much to comprehend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My favorite place is literally the back room, where odd pieces and leftovers are stacked in bins and on steel shelves, and the prices drop as low as $ 1 a dish. I long ago acquired more dishes than I could ever need, but still I seek out groups of, say, 10 dinner plates or salad plates to mix and match with the china I already own. This is the place to find it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next door is Royal Doulton, where the selection is more attuned to the regular patterns carried by department stores, only at cheaper prices. But this is also the place to look for the collector figurines this English china maker is famous for. And last time I visited, there were even Royal Crown Derby crabs in imari style -- bold blues and reds with elaborate gold details -- at half the (very expensive) normal price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other stores in this discount shopping strip attract me: the Ribbon Outlet and the Paper Factory. Both are good places to stock up on wrapping supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, my next stop is the Dansk outlet, on Route 50, just after Route 301 branches off toward Delaware. This outlet was here 15 years ago, too, but then it had mostly upgraded plastic and rustic platters instead of the flowered china, faceted crystal and Southwestern-style dinnerware of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, my favorite area is the markdown section just behind the cash registers, where I once found odd-sized cups and saucers marked down to $ 1.25 a set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carvel Hall, next door to Dansk, features the company's famous cutlery, as well as a wide selection of quality European crystal accessories and silverplated trays and bowls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chesapeake Village shopping outlet, a few hundred feet past Dansk on the opposite side of Route 50, is the latest alluring string of factory stores to settle on the Eastern Shore. High-quality clothes are the specialty here, with large outposts selling Liz Claiborne, Gitano, Evan Picone, Jones New York and Geoffrey Beene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most intriquing shop is the He-Ro store, where you'll find smashing cocktail dresses and ball gowns to rival those at any chic boutique. And there's also a 9West shoe outlet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucked amongst these sirens is the Gorham store, stacked to the ceiling with fine serving pieces that make stunning gifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I save the Kent Narrows Factory Stores for my return trip. These stores have been hard hit by the years-long bridge construction that obscured the exits. Several tenants have been lured to the newer Chesapeake Village, but the recent opening of a Bugle Boy jeans store here promises to revitalize the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is also the place to find Corning products, small electric gadgets, Pfaltzgraff and Izod stores. And it's the home of Carter's, a one-stop heaven for baby and children's clothes, from inexpensive diaper shirts to tiny Baby Dior jumpers to frilly party dresses and sturdy jeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While an excursion to the Eastern Shore takes up a big chunk of any weekend day, Potomac Mills is close enough to Washington to offer the possibility of weeknight shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tales of this place are legion -- the lines at the Guess outlet, the steals at the Macy's and Nordstrom's centers. But I hit Waccamaw, for inexpensive clear glass dishes, and then head to Fitz and Floyd and the Limoges outlet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the marked-down prices at Fitz and Floyd are pretty steep, and likewise at Limoges. Limoges's great secrets are the unmarked white &quot;blanks&quot; of dinner plates and soup bowls that, when in stock, go for under $ 5 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To my mind, West Virginia is for clothes, and with headliners such as Ralph Lauren Polo, Calvin Klein, Benetton and London Fog, who thinks about dishes? This is the most pleasant of nearby shopping trips, a two-hour drive through the Virginia countryside culminating at the renovated red-brick buildings that comprise the Blue Ridge Outlet Center, just off Route 9 in Martinsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared with the mammoth Potomac Mills, the outlet center is bright, compact and an ingenius way of recycling the sturdy former woolen mills. Further along Route 9, the Martinsburg Factory Stores offers Oshkosh B-Gosh children's clothes and Reebok/Rockport shoes among its outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with this bounty nearby, lately I've been plotting to go to Williamsburg again. The allure this time? The Lenox factory store. BAY BRIDGE MARKET PLACE --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. 50 in Annapolis, one mile west of the Bay Bridge. 24 stores, including Mikasa, Bass and Royal Doulton. Open Monday through Saturday 10 to 8, Sundays 11 to 6. Call 301/757-9181.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles Raiders said yesterday running back Bo Jackson failed a team physical this week, and doctors think Jackson won't be able to play professional football again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raiders executive assistant Al Locasale said in a telephone interview that team physicians were &quot;not optimistic&quot; that Jackson, who played baseball for the Chicago White Sox this year, could rehabilitate his injured hip and return to football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our doctors don't think he will be able to play football again,&quot; Locasale said. &quot;His doctor [James Andrews] thinks he might be able to return in 1992. But we don't see that happening.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the NFL lost for the season and maybe forever two of its biggest superstars: Jackson and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to see this league lose a guy like that,&quot; New Orleans Saints President/General Manager Jim Finks said about Montana. &quot;That hurts us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of the two stars hurts a lot of people. Besides fans, it affects the pocketbooks of advertisers and network executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Montana had elbow surgery to repair tendon damage. It was his eighth surgery in a 13-year pro career. Montana had elbow surgery in 1981 and 1989, back surgery in 1986 (thought at the time to be career-threatening), arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in 1983 and 1989, arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder in 1986, and surgery to repair a broken right hand in January 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of that time spent on the operating table -- and the fact that he will be 36 years old next season -- leads to speculation that Montana will not be able to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Dillingham, who performed the surgery on Montana, said yesterday that the operation was successful and expressed cautious optimism that Montana, a future Hall of Fame player, will be able to return. Dillingham said that during the 90-minute operation Montana's tendon was reattached to the bone in his elbow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor would not put any specifics on Montana's recovery period, but told reporters at a news conference, &quot;There's a good chance he'll return to play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a doctor who recently examined Montana told the Associated Press that Montana also has an unstable and weakened shoulder that might unhinge his comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NFL adversaries have learned never to count him out, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't seen any quarterback do what Joe has done and that is bring a club back,&quot; Finks said. &quot;He would never concede. We had him by the throat a couple of times and he got away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, who is in the final year of a five-year, $ 7.4 million contract with the Raiders, automatically received a $ 100,000 reporting bonus for taking the physical and is scheduled to get $ 416,000 in deferred signing bonuses, according to the sources. Jackson also could get an estimated $ 4 million from a disability insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson injured a hip in a football playoff game last season. During his comeback with the White Sox, it was apparent that Jackson was without much of his speed and he ran the bases with a limp because of degenerative cartilage in his hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Off the field, advertisers are trying to gauge the popularity of the injured stars and how well they may be able to sell their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson -- famous for his &quot;Bo knows&quot; commercials -- had a tremendous impact on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> profits, according to Liz Dolan, the company's vice president of corporate communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raiders defensive lineman Howie Long was the original endorser of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross training shoes from 1987 to 1988, then was replaced by Jackson in late 1988. In the three years since, sales of cross training shoes went &quot;literally from zero to over $ 300 million,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;Bo was a great way for us to communicate what cross training means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Jackson's absence could hurt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sales, Dolan said: &quot;Well, he's getting less exposure, so who really knows. But even when he's getting less exposure, he's getting more than most athletes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network executives seemed almost scared to discuss the impact a season without Montana and Jackson would have on ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the NFL might lose some viewers,&quot; said ESPN football analyst Joe Theismann, the former Redskins star. &quot;But people will also be curious to see how teams do without Montana and Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirsch, a professor at the University of Illinois and director of the privately run Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation Ltd., recently found that 84 per cent of people in a study group liked a product more when they were sitting in a room with a lightly mixed floral odor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants examined the product, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running shoes, in two separate rooms at different times, Hirsch says. One room was florally scented and the other was odor-free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were asked to rate the shoes on several factors. The shoes seen in the scented room received more favorable ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It didn't matter which room they went into first. The results showed a positive response in the odorized room,&quot; Hirsch says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoes were chosen because running shoes don't elicit an emotional response at the time of purchase, like products such as greeting cards or automobiles, Hirsch says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of the study of 31 people can be extrapolated to the population in general, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also found subliminal effects, Hirsch says. People who didn't even notice the floral scent also preferred the shoes when in that room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not endorse the use of subliminal smells,&quot; Hirsch says. &quot;To me it is like subliminal advertising at the movies and I don't think it is fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worries that scents can be exploited by unscrupulous marketers. For instance, a car dealer may use subliminal lavender odor to make the consumer feel more relaxed and trusting of sales people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of smell is also greater on women than on men, and on non-smokers than smokers, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Dion, of John C. Williams Consultants, a firm that monitors retail trends, says smell is the &quot;last frontier&quot; for marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the look and the feel of a product has an effect on the buyer,&quot; says Dion, who holds an industrial psychology degree. &quot;And the perfume companies have been working on the smell aspect for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But whether smell has an effect on buying clothing or records or whatever . . . well, there just hasn't been enough research. My hunch is there is something to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Japan, a company has gone further by developing a computerized system that can spray fragrances through buildings. Shimazo Co. has found mint smells make production line workers feel livelier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan is years ahead of North America in smell technology, Hirsch says. There is an alarm clock in Japan that sprays peppy scents, such as rose blossoms, 10 minutes before the person is to wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential use for smells can extend to lowering anxiety of airline passengers and hospital patients to increasing productivity of white- and blue-collar workers, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirsch's current study, funded by a Japanese firm, tests the effect of smells on people working with computer terminals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cincinnati Reds manager Lou Piniella lost patience with his players yesterday, suggesting in a profanity-filled tirade that they stop worrying about themselves and start thinking more about the team. Piniella erupted following an 8-4 victory over Montreal that left Cincinnati six games behind Los Angeles in the NL West. A question about reliever Randy Myers set Piniella off. Myers said this weekend that he doesn't think the Reds will keep him as a setup man for Rob Dibble, now the No. 1 closer, and he predicted he'll be traded back to the New York Mets. Myers got the victory yesterday by pitching out of a sixth-inning jam. &quot;For a guy who traded himself to the Mets two days ago, he did a good job,&quot; Piniella said. Moments later, Piniella was yelling. &quot;You can talk about trades and 'I'm going here or here.' First of all, you don't even know if the organization you want to go to wants you,&quot; Piniella said. &quot;So let's quit with all this shenanigans and just play baseball. I'm tired of hearing it, I really am. I'm sick and tired of it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Double A in Hamilton? A recent report had the Class A Redbirds ready to fly out of Hamilton. Could be, but only if the Steel City gets what it wants - a Double A expansion team in 1994, Redbirds president Rob Hilliard said yesterday. The team has been looking at alternative sites in case a move is necessary in '94. The search is compounded by the fact that the Class A New-York Penn League is looking at expansion itself, Hilliard added. The Redbirds have a stadium lease through '92 and have asked for an extension for '93.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal thumping: The Toronto Maple Leafs ran their record to 13-3, tops in the Intercounty Major Baseball League, with a 12-1 thumping of the Guelph Royals yesterday at Christie Pits. The Leafs, who pounded out 13 hits including a grand slam by Jim Wojcik, sent a dozen batters to the plate in an eight-run first-inning uprising. Marty Cerny (4-0), got the win for the Leafs with six innings of two-hit ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell's back: The San Francisco Giants have activated outfielder Kevin Mitchell and sent outfielder Rick Parker to Triple A Phoenix. Mitchell went on the 15-day disabled list on June 3, then had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's heard the rumor: White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf had heard the rumor. No, he said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in no way is underwriting Bo Jackson's Sox contract. The whisper was that if Jackson didn't make it, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - which has a promotional interest in the injured outfielder being perceived as an active player - would put up half Jackson's $700,000 1991 guarantee. &quot;The commissioner even asked me about that,&quot; Reinsdorf said. &quot;I don't even know why the commissioner would care. &quot;But it's just not true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignore standings in June? Yes and no, Oakland manager Tony La Russa says. &quot;Over the years, I've always had conversations with guys about what turns you on,&quot; La Russa said. &quot;I've talked to real good pros who like to grind, grind, grind and they look up at the standings on Sept. 1. Other real good pros look before then and get a real charge out of seeing the club at the top of the standings. I've always enjoyed being in first place. It's a matter of whatever personally gets you going. For me personally, being in first gets me going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan tops the U.S.: Hiroyasu Ito's three-run homer in a four-run seventh inning led Japan to a 10-8 victory over the United States yesterday in Game 2 of the 20th Collegiate baseball championship series at Tokyo. Japan leads the best-of-five series 2-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's taking its toll: Paul Assenmacher doesn't want a vacation, mind you. But a day off might not be such a bad thing. The Cubs' workhorse reliever came into the weekend second in the league with 38 appearances. He's on pace to pitch in a staggering 95 games, or 21 more than his career high, set last season. Part of Assenmacher's problem is that he's so strong against lefties that a manager just can't resist the temptation to call on him. But lately all the work is taking its toll; Assenmacher has allowed at least a run in his last four outings. Still, Assenmacher's not the type to complain. &quot;I'm not worried about getting my rest,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quote of the week: Cincinnati's Rob Dibble claims he's trying to control his often wild behavior. &quot;I've been clean for the last few weeks,&quot; Dibble said. &quot;I'm on the wagon. I've done things in anger, but I haven't done it on the field, so nobody knows about it. I've learned to channel my frustration better. If I'm ticked off about something now, I go out and run until I'm so tired I just want to go home and sleep.&quot;baseball; The; Inside; Pitch</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just up and did it - took its 30,000 square feet of display space and promotional razzmatazz and stayed home in Beaverton, Ore., far from the high-tech glare and hot-fuchsia neons of L.A. Gear and the newfound in-your-face, pumped-up strut of Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just blew it,&quot; clucked one waggish competitor in the trenches of Chicago's McCormick Place, where about 250,000 new products - but nary a shoelace from the absent industry giant - were unveiled recently at the World Sports Expo trade show, sponsored by the National Sporting Goods Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision by the footwear and sportswear manufacturer to forgo the Chicago show, a year after it was targeted for an ultimately ineffective boycott by Operation PUSH, may mark a new and more strategically prudent era in the great athletic shoe wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1980s were a period of stunning growth for shoe companies, whose fortunes were fuelled by a boom in jogging and aerobic sports, purported technological innovation and finely honed advertising hoopla. But the '80s have given way to a new decade in which economic retrenchment has taken a toehold in the sneaker business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales last year reached $11.3 billion (U.S.), a 10 per cent increase over 1989 but the smallest jump since 1984. And many industry analysts expect even less bounce in this year's sales figures, despite the high-flying hype for L.A. Gear's &quot;Catapult&quot; basketball shoe and Reebok's new-generation, full-foot, full-bladder Pump system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the good days, we're closely linked with the demands and moods of consumers, and in the bad days we're not so closely attuned,&quot; said Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok International Ltd., the Massachusetts-based firm that rang up $2.2 billion in sales last year. &quot;It's not ours to dictate what they want, it's ours to serve their choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Faltinek, president of the National Sporting Goods Association, also predicted a moderating trend. &quot;Footwear fashion trends, as well as market saturation, would seem to place barriers to continued growth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago trade show, spread out over three exhibit halls and 1.2 million square feet of display space, took place amid a backdrop of recessionary spending and inexorable demographic market shifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our industry is going to continue to grow and expand,&quot; vowed Craig Koenig, the president of an Ohio-based regional chain of 31 sporting goods retail stores and the association's chairman of the board. &quot;But the demographics of our mix is dramatically changing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade group's research, for example, shows a huge increase in the number of people participating in exercise walking during the past five years, even as there has been a discernible decline in the number of joggers and those who engage in more energetic aerobic exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activity trends have, of course, followed the chronological movement of the Baby Boomer generation toward middle age and the sociological shifting into two-paycheque households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people who grew up on running, racquetball and weight lifting are finding less stressful ways of staying fit,&quot; said Faltinek. &quot;As the population ages, it tends to buy less of better-quality products. (Also), the number of U.S. households with both partners working has grown dramatically. A significant amount of leisure time by both husband and wife must be devoted to household chores. Increased leisure in the U.S. is a myth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Faltinek noted that only one in five adult Americans regularly participates in a fitness activity, and if walking were excluded, that number would drop to a mere one in 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, which sponsors its own trade show in Atlanta in the winter months, said that Americans spent about $3.3 billion last year on clothing for active sports use, only 12 per cent of the total $27.4 billion dropped on sports apparel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That development - a sort of &quot;Fernando&quot; phenomenon in which it is more important to look sporty than to actually be fit - has not been lost on several apparel makers, including the reversible varsity jacket/rapper hip-hop look made by New York's Boing! Clothing Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fast-growing market for licensed apparel - festooned with college mascots or pro team logos - also is tapping in to that impulse, as underscored by the introduction of the NFL &quot;Spirit&quot; line of upscale clothing for women, whose spokesperson and chief model is Jennifer Montana, the wife of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just up and did it - took its 30,000 square feet of display space and promotional razzmatazz and stayed home in Beaverton, Ore., far from the high-tech glare and hot-fuchsia neons of L.A. Gear and the newfound in-your-face, pumped-up strut of Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just blew it,&quot; clucked one waggish competitor in the trenches of Chicago's McCormick Place, where about 250,000 new products - but nary a shoelace from the absent industry giant - were unveiled recently at the World Sports Expo trade show, sponsored by the National Sporting Goods Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision by the footwear and sportswear manufacturer to forgo the Chicago show, a year after it was targeted for an ultimately ineffective boycott by Operation PUSH, may mark a new and more strategically prudent era in the great athletic shoe wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1980s were a period of stunning growth for shoe companies, whose fortunes were fuelled by a boom in jogging and aerobic sports, purported technological innovation and finely honed advertising hoopla. But the '80s have given way to a new decade in which economic retrenchment has taken a toehold in the sneaker business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales last year reached $ 11.3 billion (U.S.), a 10 per cent increase over 1989 but the smallest jump since 1984. And many industry analysts expect even less bounce in this year's sales figures, despite the high-flying hype for L.A. Gear's &quot;Catapult&quot; basketball shoe and Reebok's new-generation, full-foot, full-bladder Pump system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the good days, we're closely linked with the demands and moods of consumers, and in the bad days we're not so closely attuned,&quot; said Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok International Ltd., the Massachusetts-based firm that rang up $ 2.2 billion in sales last year. &quot;It's not ours to dictate what they want, it's ours to serve their choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Faltinek, president of the National Sporting Goods Association, also predicted a moderating trend. &quot;Footwear fashion trends, as well as market saturation, would seem to place barriers to continued growth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Second-seeded Monica Seles is a cold-blooded killer on the tennis court, pumping balls with her two-fisted strokes like a gunman blasting a machine gun at a helpless target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask Gigi Fernandez, the unseeded U.S. doubles ace who yesterday found herself on the receiving end of a 6-1, 6-2 Seles thumping in the U.S. Open quarterfinals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little to rehash about a match which lasted 53 minutes, so Seles offered her thoughts on a number of subjects. When reporters asked how Seles could champion equal prize money for such unmemorable fare - losing quarterfinalists at the Open, men and women, pocket $51,900 - Seles waded right in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think (on) average, if you look, there would be more interesting matches in women's draw at the thournament,' she blithely announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then breezily consigning thrillers such as Jimmy Connors' miraculous comeback from 2-5 down in the fifth to defeat Aaron Krickstein as &quot;the exceptions . . . the bonuses,&quot; Seles added: &quot;I don't think you go by quality. I think a lot of times when you watch men's tennis and they go five sets, you are up to here with them.&quot; She illustrated by brushing her hand across her forehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they make the equal prize money (everywhere) it's not going to be that much of a difference to us when you're earning at this level,&quot; continued Seles, whose official pre-U.S. Open prize money was just less than $3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just like the principle of being equal. I think it's a much better feeling when you are going out on the court and you feel equal. Because, you know, the women's level of the game is there. I mean, look at just the serves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, the average speed of Seles' first serve yesterday was 73 m.p.h. The average speed of the men's serves who competed on the stadium court where there is a radar gun is about 108 m.p.h. The fastest male serve clocked is 126 m.p.h. by Wimbledon champ Michael Stich. The fastest woman is American Debbie Graham at 105 m.p.h.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, after her 6-2, 6-0 first-round destruction of American Nicole Arendt, she volunteered that she'd like to ape Andre Agassi (and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and bring a new look to tennis clothes. To this end, she said she'd faxed three or four of her ideas to Fila, the Italian designer whose Monica Seles line of clothes she's paid to wear on court. When she'd had no response to her fax, she phoned, only to discover everyone was on holiday for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Seles envisions is something less unconventional than Agassi's Just Do It line from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> something sophisticated in keeping with Fila's image; fun but adventuresome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just what she meant by adventuresome was the subject of hot discussion after CBS-TV cameramen shooting her match with Czechoslovak Regina Rajchrtova told other media that when Seles served it looked as if she were &quot;mooning&quot; the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were already pictures shot during an earlier match showing Seles wore no bra. Had she stopped wearing panties as well? Or was she wearing one of those new high-cut numbers that look like an athletic version of a G-string?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out all the subsequent talk was just cheeky speculation. Courtside photographers report Seles wore ordinary white tennis panties while she blitzed Fernandez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray power: Be sure to look closely when Jimmy (the Miracle Worker) Connors plays Holland's Paul Haarhuis tomorrow night - especially if the television shows a recap of the 39-year-old, five-time U.S. Open champ's stellar career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you'll discover is that not only is Jimbo trying to turn back the hands of time on court, but he's also dying the tattletale gray from his body-permed hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor delivery: Despite having signed a large contract, reputed to be between $750,000 and $1 million a year, right after Wimbledon with the Yamaha racket manufacturing company, Gabriela Sabatini, the defending women's champion, is not playing with the new wide-bodied model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Toronto, where she defaulted in the semifinals with a blister, many noticed that her never-that-trustworthy serve had zero pop and that even her trademark top-spin groundies lacked their usual fizz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seems Yamaha has yet to come up with a racket that plays like the Prince graphite, the racket Sabatini grew up using.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too low-profile: An interesting discovery is that Michael Stich, after winning what's billed as the most prestigious tournament on earth - Wimbledon - has not been inundated with offers to endorse everything under the sun. While he says that his Swiss management agency is sorting though proposals, the fact remains that Stich has not signed a single contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian wins: Stephanie Tibbets, the last of the seven Canadian girls in the junior U.S. Open, won her opening-round match, upsetting Japan's Mamie Donoshiro, the No. 13 seed, 6-0, 2-6, 6-4. The other two Canadians still in action are Toronto's Suzanne Italiano and Montreal's Greg Rusedski.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're worried Little Mikey is fast becoming a mindless consumer, not the conscientious citizen you'd hoped for, meet an influential ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's Michael Jacobson - veteran consumer activist, co-founder and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a regular talking head south of the border on matters of nutrition and health safety, an established figure on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Nader-like bite, Science in the Public Interest has been on the backs of the U.S. food industry for 20 years. It's taken on fast-food giants for their fat-ladened fare and fought against false and deceptive food labelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recently held its annual Worst Advertising of the Year awards, featuring &quot;the most misleading, unfair or irresponsible ad campaigns of 1991.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson and a host of educators, consumer advocates, religious leaders and media critics expanded the crusade when they launched the Centre for the Study of Commercialism last January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funded by foundation grants and membership contributions, the non-profit organization promotes civic involvement and moderate consumption, while publicizing the infusion of commercial interests into people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre has so far denounced the likes of Cineplex Odeon, for showing ads before movies and further commercializing leisure activities, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for planned obsolescence and target marketing: &quot;To keep people buying, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continually redesigns their sneakers, broadcasts funky, high-flying ads, and uses sports heroes to propangandize . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has lambasted the world of product placement - the practice of prominently displaying popular name brands in movies - as a &quot;powerful and deceitful advertising techninque because consumers aren't told they're being advertised to.&quot; It wants film studios to have to announce to audiences at the start of movies what products will be advertised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson says it's not that all things commercial are inherently evil. It's just that there's no longer any balance. We're blinded by the excess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children are being raised to be consumers who will 'buy till they die' to the detriment of their own health, the environment and society,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greed, selfishness and materialism reign supreme in the North American lifestyle, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North American lifestyle is one in which greed, selfishness and materialism reign supreme, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marketers are looking for every possible niche in which to sell products,&quot; he laments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't be fooled into thinking we in the great white north are immune, Jacobson notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not content with the string of ads plastered on the arena's boards, Maple Leaf Gardens is now allowing corporations to buy space on the ice of the Gardens - that's right, the ice surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just in time for the holiday season, several Metro-area malls announced a &quot;shop around the clock&quot; promotion, keeping stores open right up until midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also of great concern, Jacobson says, are the growing partnerships between business and education. It's not scholarships or funding for libraries that bothers the centre. Fast-food firms, for instance, are getting into the schools (and the minds of impressionable buyers) by running such things as reading programs with restaurant coupons as incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When corporations call the shots, Jacobson warns, they also control the messages: touting their goals, their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to examine how much of our lives are oriented around buying products and socializing in malls, as compared to being involved with community activities, our families and hobbies,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's especially appropriate at this time of year, he suggests, to look at how much of our giving is going to those truly in need. The average person faces hundreds of commercial messages each day. When is he or she ever encouraged to contribute, to give back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ads slip into books, fill sporting venues, line subway cars, are posted in medical offices (as &quot;health&quot; messages), public restrooms, art exhibits and concerts. If it's wearable, chances are there's a corporate signature on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We leave home to an onslaught of radio, TV, newspaper and billboard advertisements and come home to a flood of junk mail and junk phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seemingly endless contests, promotions, bonuses and clubs. We're enticed to buy so that we can get something we didn't ask for but will take anyway because it's free - we think. We spend, spend, spend so we can save.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entire magazines are developed and designed to sell products under the pretence of helping us feel better about ourselves. Meanwhile, we dig ourselves deeper into debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the blurred sales pitches designed to look like news and information, the &quot;advertorials&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson says we've become so used to living with ads we hardly notice the commercial censorship that's going on. It's the messages we don't get that can also be harmful. (How many public service ads have you seen promoting nutrition and civic mindedness? Then count the number of toy, cereal and restaurant ads you've seen of late.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only does commercialism drain our wallets, Jacobson says, it creates an insatiable appetite for more and fosters feelings of envy, anxiety and insecurity. We're not just buying a product - we're buying the belief that we'll be more attractive, live longer, have more friends . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very powerful forces telling us that buying should be our preoccupation, that we should spend our lives shopping,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean Kilbourne, a lecturer and an adviser to the commercialism centre, in her film Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women, summed up the power of advertising this way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Advertising is one of the most powerful socializing forces in the culture. And the effects are as inescapable as the effects of pollution in the air . . . Ads sell more than products. They sell images, values, goals, concepts of who we are and who we should be . . . They shape our attitudes and our attitudes shape our behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre advocates:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Boosting the cost of sending junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Banning junk telephone calls and advertising aimed at children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Eliminating corporate promotions in schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Creating public service messages encouraging people to consume less, to be skeptical of advertising claims and to spend TV-free days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Developing curricula on commercialism and media literacy for high school students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Increased public support for civic organizations and museums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its first year, the centre hotly criticized Washington's Smithsonian Institution for &quot;plugging products and companies&quot; and asked it to &quot;reverse the decisions that allow corporations to invade its facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kids will leave (the Smithsonian) tugging at a parent's shirt sleeve, begging for Lego bricks and Batman paraphernalia,&quot; says Jacobson of one exhibit. &quot;And why not? The Lego logo is given top billing. It's far more eye-catching and attractive than the bland blurbs about the animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum there's The Real Thing, an exhibit based on artefacts supplied by Coca-Cola Co., including some two dozen original oil paintings by the late artist Haddon Sundblom, credited with creating the modern-day Santa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa at the ROM isn't Santa unless, of course, he's got his Coke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrote Star art critic Christopher Hume of the show: &quot;Everywhere you turn, there he (Santa) is - peeking into a dwarf fridge from the '50s looking for a Coke; sitting in an armchair, waited on by two children bringing him a Coke; playing with toys he has just delivered, drinking, well, what else?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What purports to be a look at the impact of commercial art on Christmas is actually a tour through the golden age of Coke magazine advertising,&quot; Hume concluded. &quot;The two are different. To make matters worse, the exhibition is sponsored by Coca-Cola and titled to reflect that. The inescapable conclusion is that the ROM has been fully co-opted by a soft-drink manufacturer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson says the ROM has sold a part of its soul for an exhibit Torontonians could well have lived without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children will have the name Coca-Cola even more firmly established in their minds. And it will be associated not with tooth decay and obesity and the term junk food, but with the prestige of the museum.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're worried Little Mikey is fast becoming a mindless consumer, not the conscientious citizen you'd hoped for, meet an influential ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's Michael Jacobson - veteran consumer activist, co-founder and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a regular talking head south of the border on matters of nutrition and health safety, an established figure on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Nader-like bite, Science in the Public Interest has been on the backs of the U.S. food industry for 20 years. It's taken on fast-food giants for their fat-ladened fare and fought against false and deceptive food labelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recently held its annual Worst Advertising of the Year awards, featuring &quot;the most misleading, unfair or irresponsible ad campaigns of 1991.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson and a host of educators, consumer advocates, religious leaders and media critics expanded the crusade when they launched the Centre for the Study of Commercialism last January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funded by foundation grants and membership contributions, the non-profit organization promotes civic involvement and moderate consumption, while publicizing the infusion of commercial interests into people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre has so far denounced the likes of Cineplex Odeon, for showing ads before movies and further commercializing leisure activities, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for planned obsolescence and target marketing: &quot;To keep people buying, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continually redesigns their sneakers, broadcasts funky, high-flying ads, and uses sports heroes to propangandize . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has lambasted the world of product placement - the practice of prominently displaying popular name brands in movies - as a &quot;powerful and deceitful advertising techninque because consumers aren't told they're being advertised to.&quot; It wants film studios to have to announce to audiences at the start of movies what products will be advertised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson says it's not that all things commercial are inherently evil. It's just that there's no longer any balance. We're blinded by the excess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children are being raised to be consumers who will 'buy till they die' to the detriment of their own health, the environment and society,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greed, selfishness and materialism reign supreme in the North American lifestyle, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North American lifestyle is one in which greed, selfishness and materialism reign supreme, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marketers are looking for every possible niche in which to sell products,&quot; he laments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't be fooled into thinking we in the great white north are immune, Jacobson notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not content with the string of ads plastered on the arena's boards, Maple Leaf Gardens is now allowing corporations to buy space on the ice of the Gardens - that's right, the ice surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just in time for the holiday season, several Metro-area malls announced a &quot;shop around the clock&quot; promotion, keeping stores open right up until midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also of great concern, Jacobson says, are the growing partnerships between business and education. It's not scholarships or funding for libraries that bothers the centre. Fast-food firms, for instance, are getting into the schools (and the minds of impressionable buyers) by running such things as reading programs with restaurant coupons as incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When corporations call the shots, Jacobson warns, they also control the messages: touting their goals, their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to examine how much of our lives are oriented around buying products and socializing in malls, as compared to being involved with community activities, our families and hobbies,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's especially appropriate at this time of year, he suggests, to look at how much of our giving is going to those truly in need. The average person faces hundreds of commercial messages each day. When is he or she ever encouraged to contribute, to give back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ads slip into books, fill sporting venues, line subway cars, are posted in medical offices (as &quot;health&quot; messages), public restrooms, art exhibits and concerts. If it's wearable, chances are there's a corporate signature on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We leave home to an onslaught of radio, TV, newspaper and billboard advertisements and come home to a flood of junk mail and junk phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seemingly endless contests, promotions, bonuses and clubs. We're enticed to buy so that we can get something we didn't ask for but will take anyway because it's free - we think. We spend, spend, spend so we can save.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entire magazines are developed and designed to sell products under the pretence of helping us feel better about ourselves. Meanwhile, we dig ourselves deeper into debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the blurred sales pitches designed to look like news and information, the &quot;advertorials&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobson says we've become so used to living with ads we hardly notice the commercial censorship that's going on. It's the messages we don't get that can also be harmful. (How many public service ads have you seen promoting nutrition and civic mindedness? Then count the number of toy, cereal and restaurant ads you've seen of late.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only does commercialism drain our wallets, Jacobson says, it creates an insatiable appetite for more and fosters feelings of envy, anxiety and insecurity. We're not just buying a product - we're buying the belief that we'll be more attractive, live longer, have more friends . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very powerful forces telling us that buying should be our preoccupation, that we should spend our lives shopping,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean Kilbourne, a lecturer and an adviser to the commercialism centre, in her film Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women, summed up the power of advertising this way:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the commotion over Bo Jackson's future as an athlete, it should be remembered that he defied what happened to happen. And it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midway through the 1987 baseball season, the Kansas City Royals outfielder decided that he would also join the Los Angeles Raiders as a running back -- Jim Thorpe in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials. When he glibly described playing pro football as a &quot;hobby,&quot; he was reminded that stamp collecting is a hobby, that being mauled by linebackers is not a hobby, that a serious football injury could diminish, if not jeopardize, his baseball career. But like so many other gifted athletes who consider themselves to be indestructible, Bo knows insistence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whatever comes after the baseball season,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is a hobby for Bo Jackson, just like hunting and fishing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, sadly, Bo's hobby has hobbled him. One of the fastest athletes in the world is on crutches. After having suffered a fracture-dislocation of his left hip in a open-field, one-on-one tackle during a National Football League playoff game on Jan. 13, he developed traumatic chondrolysis of the hip joint and avascular necrosis of the femoral head, a condition as serious as it sounds. Because of a lack of blood supply, his hip-socket cartilage and the top of his thighbone are deteriorating, not healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo's future in both baseball and football is uncertain. His hobby has turned into a horror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo thought it would be fun to play both sports. At least that's what he thought back in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more I thought about playing football and baseball -- I knew Jim Thorpe had done it a long time ago; I saw the movie about him -- the more it sounded like fun,&quot; he recalled in his best-seller autobiography, &quot;Bo Knows Bo (Doubleday),&quot; written in collaboration with Dick Schaap. &quot;That really was the attraction. I thought it'd be fun. It had nothing to do with wanting to prove anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd proved in college that I could play football. I'd proved in Kansas City that I could play baseball. And it had nothing to do with money. I didn't need any more money than I was getting from the Royals, and I knew I could live on a lot less. I just didn't want to cheat myself out of some fun. I didn't want to look back in 20 years and think, 'Wouldn't it have been fun doing that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in enjoying the fun of four years of playing both baseball and football, Bo may have cheated himself out of the fun of developing into one of baseball's true superstars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Bo returns to the big leagues, it's difficult to believe that he will be as fast or as reckless as he was. His speed is sure to be slowed by his damaged hip. Perhaps his bat speed will be slowed too. That was the risk he took when he joined the Raiders, the risk that just about everybody but Bo accepted as inevitable. For a running back, the usual injury is &quot;a knee,&quot; as football people call it. Torn ligaments, torn cartilage. But being different, Bo went down with a hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What N.F.L. orthopedists call a &quot;hip pointer&quot; occurs every so often. Originally, that's how Bo's injury was diagnosed. But instead of getting better, it got worse. Just as Bo was a rarity, so was his injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other football players have recovered from a similar injury, notably George Adams, a New England Patriots running back. After having been the Giants' first-round draft choice in 1985, he missed the entire 1986 season with what the Giants then called a &quot;chipped pelvic bone&quot; but what has recently been described as &quot;almost identical&quot; to Jackson's ailment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George was on crutches that whole season,&quot; said Ottis Anderson, the Giants running back, on Friday after accepting the Potamkin male athlete of the year award. &quot;But George came back in 1987, and he's been playing ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's why Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general genius, keeps predicting that Bo Jackson will be a running back again, possibly in the upcoming season. But will he be the same running back? And when Bo was on waivers after the Royals released him last Monday, none of the 26 major-league teams considered him worth the risk of assuming his Royals salary of $2,375,000 this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yankees had first crack, but according to General Manager Gene Michael, &quot;there wasn't one doctor who felt we should take the risk.&quot; The new Yankee front office decided not to throw bad money after bad, such as the three-year $5.6 million investment in Pascual Perez that produced a 1-2 record last season. More important, George Steinbrenner apparently had no say in the decision. That's progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sooner or later, look for Bo to return to baseball with an &quot;if&quot; contract -- a modest signing bonus plus a graduated salary depending on how soon and how much he plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't worry about Bo's finances. Like most multimillion dollar athletes, he is insured for millions against the possibility of a career-ending injury or accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shame is that Bo had the power tools to be one of baseball's most dominant players if he had concentrated on baseball. He hit broken-bat home runs to the opposite field. He once nailed a baserunner at the plate with a 300-foot arrow to the catcher, on the fly. He outran infielders' throws to first base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo could do it all in baseball -- all but work on reducing his strikeouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since joining the Royals in 1986, Bo struck out 638 times, roughly once every third official at-bat. If he had gone to the Instructional League every November, maybe he could have educated himself to the parameters of the strike zone. He preferred to join the Raiders every November instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what Bo Jackson thought would be fun may turn out to be, in an athletic sense, funereal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whatever comes after the baseball season,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is a hobby for Bo Jackson, just like hunting and fishing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, sadly, Bo's hobby has hobbled him. One of the fastest athletes in the world is on crutches.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yankees had first crack, but according to General Manager Gene Michael, &quot;there wasn't one doctor who felt we should take the risk.&quot; The new Yankee front office decided not to throw bad money after bad, such as the three-year $5.6 million investment in Pascual Perez that produced a 1-2 record last season. More important, George Steinbrenner apparently had no say in the decision. That's progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sooner or later, look for Bo to return to baseball with an &quot;if&quot; contract -- a modest signing bonus plus a graduated salary depending on how soon and how much he plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't worry about Bo's finances. Like most multimillion dollar athletes, he is insured for millions against the possibility of a career-ending injury or accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shame is that Bo had the power tools to be one of baseball's most dominant players if he had concentrated on baseball. He hit broken-bat home runs to the opposite field. He once nailed a baserunner at the plate with a 300-foot arrow to the catcher, on the fly. He outran infielders' throws to first base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo could do it all in baseball -- all but work on reducing his strikeouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since joining the Royals in 1986, Bo struck out 638 times, roughly once every third official at-bat. If he had gone to the Instructional League every November, maybe he could have educated himself to the parameters of the strike zone. He preferred to join the Raiders every November instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what Bo Jackson thought would be fun may turn out to be, in an athletic sense, funereal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the commotion over Bo Jackson's future as an athlete, it should be remembered that he defied what happened to happen. And it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midway through the 1987 baseball season, the Kansas City Royals outfielder decided that he would also join the Los Angeles Raiders as a running back -- Jim Thorpe in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commercials. When he glibly described playing pro football as a &quot;hobby,&quot; he was reminded that stamp collecting is a hobby, that being mauled by linebackers is not a hobby, that a serious football injury could diminish, if not jeopardize, his baseball career. But like so many other gifted athletes who consider themselves to be indestructible, Bo knows insistence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series, called &quot;The Ghostwriter,&quot; is scheduled to begin on PBS stations in the fall of 1992. The target audience will be children 7 to 10 years old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Children's Television Workshop announced the beginning of production after receiving a commitment for a $5 million grant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., the maker of athletic shoes. Nana Griller, the assistant director of information at Children's Television Workshop, said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grant was the largest single corporate donation ever made to a children's television show. The show's overall budget will be $20 million for 48 episodes, with about $8.8 million coming from PBS and Children's Television Workshop, and the rest from other foundation and Government sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive producer of &quot;The Ghostwriter&quot; is Elizabeth Nealon, formerly vice president of MTV International. The show's stylistic approach will incorporate visual and musical techniques borrowed from MTV, Ms. Griller said. The format will also use graphics to make the reading of print on screen more entertaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories will center on six children, three girls and three boys, and their interaction with an unseen ghost who can communicate with them only through writing. At the end of the first season, the ghost will be revealed to be a famous writer from the 15th or 16th century -- but not Shakespeare, Ms. Griller said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Bo knows everything, one could plausibly argue that Portland knows advertising. So where better to locate the only museum in the United States devoted solely to advertising?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portland, after all, is home to Wieden &amp; Kennedy, currently the ad trade's hottest agency, whose 10 years of work for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> athletic shoes -- including the slogans &quot;Bo knows&quot; and &quot;Just Do It&quot; -- are the subject of a study by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, in addition to the advertising, Portland has the American Advertising Museum. As a result, this city finds itself in the middle of a debate among anthropologists and historians, who have long argued whether magazine and newspaper ads, television spots, and radio commercials deserve a place in the halls of academe and on museum walls.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Amazed by the Lack of Study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Jan Kurtz, the museum's executive director, strolled past photographs of the late comedian Ed Wynn dressed in his Texaco fire chief's garb and exhibits showing the evolution of Marlboro cigarettes from a women's to a men's brand, she expressed annoyance that anyone would question advertising's place in the scholarly orbit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the role advertising has played in the lives of ordinary Americans and its influence on business and design, it's amazing how little it's been studied,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1973 Book, &quot;The Americans: The Democratic Experience,&quot; the historian Daniel J. Boorstin wrote that &quot;the force of the advertising word and image would dwarf the power of other literature&quot; in the 20th century. And yet, he complained, it &quot;has been less adequately chronicled than almost any other major institution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18 years since Dr. Boorstin's lament have brought a striking change, with historians who once deigned to study only the writings of diplomats now dipping into housewives' diaries and other remains of &quot;low culture.&quot; Advertising, as a chronicle of the fantasies of regular Americans, has benefited from the renewed interest in cultural and social history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's certainly been a mini-boom in the last five years and a renewal of interest in advertising and what it tells us about American life,&quot; said Scott A. Ellsworth, the chief historian at the Center for Advertising History at the Smithsonian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing number of social and cultural historians have visited the Smithsonian's collection, which includes oral histories of advertising campaigns for Alka-Seltzer, Pepsi-Cola, Marlboro, Federal Express, Cover Girl makeup and Campbell soup, said Mr. Ellsworth, who was in Portland recently working on an oral history of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth of the American Advertising Museum, which in June celebrated its fifth anniversary, provides further evidence that advertising's intellectual stature is rising. Founded with $300,000 in seed money from the Portland Advertising Federation and a meager crop of advertising books, the museum's collection now includes 200,000 print advertisements dating back more than a century, 44,000 slides of billboards and a library of 4,000 advertising books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important may be the steady stream of visitors, from the professional to the merely curious, to take in the public exhibits.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Museum Is Crowded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-four thousand people stopped by the museum during a seven-week period in 1988 to view its exhibition on the history of Claymation, the process that animated the &quot;California Raisins,&quot; which was developed by a Portland resident, Will Vinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interest in the museum has grown so much that its staff of four, with support from Advertising Age magazine, has assembled a traveling exhibit that will start making its way around country this fall. Titled &quot;Advertising Comes of Age: The History of Advertising 1920-1969,&quot; the exhibit will open at the Art Directors Club in New York on Sept. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the museum's holdings would be classified as mere curiosities. On display is the uniform of Johnny Roventini, the bellhop whose &quot;call for Philip Morris!&quot; resounded in radio ads in the 1940's, and a history of the Planter's Nut and Chocolate Company's monocled dandy, &quot;Mr. Peanut,&quot; which was created in 1916 by Antonio Gentile, a 13-year-old schoolboy from Suffolk, Va., who was awarded $5 for his effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other pieces well illustrate many of the currents in American culture. Political advertisements in the museum show that criticism of political marketing dates back to Andrew Jackson's Presidential campaign in 1828, when a rabble of frontiersmen, small farmers and urban workers led him to victory over President John Quincy Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question, which was first asked then, is how do you get mass communication without resorting to the sound bite,&quot; Ms. Kurtz asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Kurtz, a 29-year-old American who grew up in Ethiopia, one of six children of Presbyterian missionaries, said advertising was also a way for an outsider like herself to discover the peculiarities of contemporary culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Just do it,' &quot; she said, referring to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advertising slogan, &quot;says something about Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trading lower most of the day on a worrisome inflation report, stock prices made a strong comeback yesterday to finish mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.19 points to finish at 3,065.30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderately heavy at 184.5 million shares, down from 199.5 million on Tuesday. The Big Board composite was up 0.37, to 219.37, with losing issues narrowly outpacing gainers by 833 to 778.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.67 to finish at 397.41, a new high for the second consecutive day, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.56, to 391.81.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A late surge of buying narrowly helped the Nasdaq index to its fifth record high in five days, to 556.17, up 0.49. Similarly, the Russell 2,000 was up 0.2, to 188.04.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Stocks Off Most of Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stocks were down for most of the day after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released October producer prices that showed the highest monthly increase in a year. The news immediately touched off investor concern about rising inflation and put investors on the defensive ahead of today's consumer price numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sharply lower bond market weighed heavily on stocks early, but they recouped some of their losses after the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, Janet Norwood, said the core Producer Price Index may have been overstated by one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Labe, chief investment strategist for Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross, said the market's initial reaction to the producer prices data, and then the turnaround, was a typical reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted the across-the-board activity where just about every issue was hit, and was mildly impressed with the day's volume that showed there was widespread participation. &quot;There is probably no case yet for an up market, or down market, in the near term,&quot; he said. &quot;But staying in a narrow range does afford investors the opportunity to wade into the market to pick some good stocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trading yesterday, Immune Response said the clinical trials of its HIV therapeutic vaccine seemed to show the drug safe, but had not yet shown whether it was effective. The stock fell 15 3/4, to 46, after a Food and Drug Administration panel meeting reduced hopes of a quick approval of the vaccine, as a number of analysts lowered their ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shares fell 1 1/8, to 62 1/4 yesterday, as Josie Esquivel, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, lowered her rating on the athletic shoe maker after the stock reached her 1992 price target. She noted that no further adjustments were made on the stock, like earnings estimates, and expects the stock to appreciate from 10 to 25 percent over the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Oppenheimer analyst, George Krug, Tuesday's Department of Agriculture crop report of low grain inventories looks good for increased plantings next year, with an increased demand for fertilizer. IMC Fertilizer stock rose 3/8 to close at 51 3/4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After telling analysts on Tuesday that it would probably not meet 1992 earnings projections, Kimberly-Clark shares fell 6 3/8 yesterday, to 94, as several analysts reduced their earnings estimates and a few, their ratings. The company held a two-day meeting with analysts, which started on Tuesday, and said analysts' 1991 forecasts were in the ballpark, and their 1992 estimates were possible, but highly doubtful unless market conditions changed fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nordstrom, the shoe and apparel retailer, was down 1 5/8, to 37 1/2, as analysts lowered year-end earnings estimates, after the retailer reported disappointing third-quarter results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the coin, Campbell Soup reported a 25 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, to $1.02 a share, compared to 82 cents a share, and the stock responded by rising 1 7/8, to 81 3/8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said that United Technologies is likely to take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of at least $500 million to pay for its efforts to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, as the stock rose 1/2 to close at 50 1/8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for concern about dilution, analysts who follow Goodyear could not find a specific reason for the price decline in the stock, as the tire maker's secondary offering of 12 million shares, priced at $50 a share, began trading. The stock was off 1 1/8, to 49 3/8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traders said after Scimed Life Systems told analysts at a meeting in California that it was not on the verge of pulling its Express Catheters from the United States because of patent challenges, the stock rose 6 1/4, to 58 1/2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kansas City Royals took a stunning step today, placing Bo Jackson, the oft-injured two-sport star, on unconditional-release waivers. A lawyer for the Players Association immediately challenged the propriety of the release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herk Robinson, the club's general manager, announced the Royals' action at a news conference at their spring training complex in Haines City, Fla.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;We've got nearly $2.5 million involved in a situation like this; finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move came amid unconfirmed reports that Jackson would not be able to play baseball or football again because of complications after an injury to his left hip. He suffered the injury playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in a National Football League playoff game on Jan. 13.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>'Don't Count Me Out'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackson, at his own news conference in Birmingham, Ala., said today that he believed he would be able to play baseball this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't count me out,&quot; the 28-year-old Jackson said at a brief news conference with Dr. James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, shortly before the Royals' announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dean Vogelaar, the Royals' vice president for public relations, said by telephone from Haines City: &quot;Based on the medical reports we have, there is a real question mark in our minds whether he can physically perform, this year or ever. We're not saying he's never going to play, but at this point we feel he can't perform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogelaar said the Royals were releasing Jackson under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the uniform player's contract, but Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Players Association, questioned the team's right to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My initial reaction is that this is an improper release,&quot; Orza said by telephone from his home in New York. &quot;Before reaching a firm conclusion, I want to talk to his agent and see all of the doctors' reports, but my initial impression is they cannot do this without substantial financial responsibility.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Four Years of 2 Sports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackson, who has played professional baseball and professional football in the same year for four years and has been injured in each sport in each of those years, has a contract for the 1991 baseball season for $2,375,000. By releasing him now, the Royals said, they would owe him only 30 days' termination pay, which computes to $395,833, a savings for the club of $1,979,167. The club's right to release him now without paying him his entire salary, though, is what Orza questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Orza's view turns out to be correct, most likely as determined by an arbitrator, the Royals could wind up paying Jackson his entire salary having lost him as a released player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pertinent contract clause cited by the Royals says a club can release a player if the player shall &quot;fail, in the opinion of the club's management, to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify or continue as a member of the club's team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A club can release a player if he is injured as a result of a baseball mishap, but it would have to pay him his entire salary. Vogelaar noted that Jackson suffered his injury playing football, adding that he &quot;hasn't been on a baseball field one day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their claim, I guess, is that there is an inability to play because of an injury incurred outside baseball,&quot; Orza said. But he added: &quot;I can't imagine that they didn't know he was injured in football when he signed their contract. After he was injured and before he signed, he reported to the Royals' team physician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson agreed to his Royals contract on Feb. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report from the Royals' team physician, Dr. Steve Joyce, &quot;special X-ray studies&quot; were preformed on Jackson Feb. 14-15 and they &quot;confirmed the loss of joint cartilage space and the development of early avascular necrosis of the femoral head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss of cartilage in Bo's case exceeds what is normally seen in the early stages of avascular necrosis,&quot; the report continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease, in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, is normally associated with older people and is rarely caused by single injury.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>'Significant Injury'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additional studies, Joyce's report said, prompted a recommendation to Jackson and the Royals' management &quot;that he not participate in the 1991 baseball season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews, while declining to comment on the reports of avascular necrosis, said it was a significant injury and that blood flow to the hip joint was being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been no collapse of his hip joint,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;That's the reason we're putting him on crutches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in a protective phase at this point,&quot; said the doctor, who left open the possibility that Jackson may eventually be able to play football for the Raiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to speculate,&quot; Raiders Coach Art Shell said today in Hawaii, where he was attending the National Football League meetings. &quot;The doctor gave me some name of the injury. It was slight dislocation and with rest he would be all right. With rest, he's supposed to be able to play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Orza's view, if the Royals proceeded with the release of Jackson, they would have to pay him his entire 1991 salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royals will officially put Jackson on the waiver list Tuesday. Clubs will have 72 hours in which they can claim the outfielder for $1. If he clears waivers Friday, he would be free to sign with any team. If a club claims him, it would be responsible for his 1991 salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Jackson can't play one or both sports, it could affect his lucrative career as an advertising pitchman. Jackson may be as well-known for his &quot;Bo Knows&quot; series of ads for the athletic footwear company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as he is for his play for the Raiders and the Royals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman, Liz Dolan, said today that no matter what the doctors advised Jackson to do about his hip, it wouldn't affect his contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have never canceled a contract with an athlete due to an injury,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately, injury is part of sports and we understand that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will the commercial offers end if Jackson's hip injury cuts his career short, reducing Bo to more average proportions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Burns, who heads Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, said he doubted that any advertisers will end their contracts with Jackson if he is out all year and it is clear it is only for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he is out period, I do think the advertising will stop,&quot; he said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Jackson's Injuries<BR>&nbsp;<BR>By The Associated Press<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1984: Missed half his junior football season with Auburn because of a shoulder injury.<BR>1985: Sustained a deep thigh bruise and missed the second half of Auburn's 14-10 loss to Florida and the last three games of the season.<BR>May 31, 1988: Tore left hamstring running out a grounder at Cleveland. Did not return until July 2.<BR>July 26, 1989: Placed on the 15-day disabled list with a pulled quadricep muscle in his left leg.<BR>July 17, 1990: Sustained minor tissue damage in his left shoulder, attempting a diving catch of a ball hit by Deion Sanders of the Yankees. Stayed on the disabled list until Aug. 25.<BR>Jan. 13, 1991: Sustained hip injury in Raiders' playoff game.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed with large advertising budgets and superstar pitchmen,<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada Ltd.&nbsp; and Reebok Canada Inc. dominate the $600-million athletic shoe business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an industry where marketing prowess is as important as product quality, it's difficult for consumers to ignore pitches featuring high-profile athletes such as Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with this daunting reality, Avia Canada recently launched its first radio campaign with an unorthodox approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than imitating its bigger rivals, Avia's quirky commercials used on-the-street interviews to see if people recognized the brand. The answers ranged from spring water to toilet paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the same question was posed to ''passionately committed athletes'' in fitness clubs - Avia's target market - the brand was easily identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Herbert, Avia Canada's general manager, said the challenge facing smaller players is finding ways to break through the clutter of larger competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''For someone to blast into this market you obviously don't do it by spending against (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok),'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''You have to do in a way that's going to catch people's interest. We try to do it in a way that's humorous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marketing consultant Tony Long, president of the Long Group in Toronto, said Avia's off-beat advertising campaign and clearly defined target market illustrates how small companies must develop distinct strategies to establish a foothold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than going head-to-head against well-known brands, Long said the best approach is to identify specific niches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''If the big brands focus on media advertising, you should focus on consumer promotion, packaging or on the trade to buy shelf space,'' he said. ''Pick one or two tactics and put all your dollars behind them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drew Knox, vice-president of marketing and sales with Northern Algonquin Brewing Co. Ltd., said the company has worked hard at making sure each of its brands is clearly differentiated from its rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We've tried to be right in the middle, and come out with a product that has more flavor and a bigger taste than the mainstream beers but not as highly hopped as the micro-brewed beers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, Algonquin became the first micro-brewery to advertise on television. Its distinctive spots promoted the taste of the product and the brewery's heritage - a sharp contrast to most campaigns, which feature youthful lifestyle themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We have something to say about the beer because product is hero,'' Knox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another approach is to find a segment of the market unhappy with the major brands, said Long, and develop a strategy to take advantage of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Montreal-based Cott Beverages Ltd. followed this strategy after acquiring the rights to distribute Royal Crown Cola in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Berthiaume, private label sales manager with Cott, said Royal Crown's biggest selling point is that it costs less than rivals Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola, both of which boast expensive marketing budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We can offer a better price because we don't have to support the marketing and television commercials,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant appealed the decision of the Liberty Superior Court (Georgia) convicting defendant of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant contended the trial court erred by permitting a witness to testify who previously served as an alternate juror in the case, by denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict, and by denying defendant's' motion for a new trial. The court held that the transcript showed that in accordance with the trial court's instructions the alternate juror did not discuss his knowledge with the other jurors, and that there was no opportunity for him to do so since he stated that he did not realize he had information about this case until in open court he saw the property and shortly thereafter made this known to the trial court. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to neither a directed verdict or a new trial because a review of the evidence in this matter revealed ample evidence from which any rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the offense charged. Finally, the court held that the accomplice's testimony was sufficiently corroborated. Accordingly, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*102]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**200]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard Lee Jones appeals his conviction for burglary. He contends the trial court erred by permitting a witness to testify who previously served as an alternate juror in the case, by denying Jones' motion for a directed verdict, and by denying Jones' motion for a new trial. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Held</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The transcript shows that after the jury was impaneled and evidence presented, an alternate juror recognized an item taken in the burglary as property someone attempted to pawn in his pawnshop.  The transcript also shows the State was not aware of this information and the alternate juror had not discussed his knowledge with any of the other jurors. After the alternate juror was excused without objection, the former juror was called as a witness for the State and was allowed to testify over Jones' sole objection that allowing the juror to testify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  created &quot;an appearance of impropriety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Jones acknowledges the controlling precedent in this state is contrary to his argument (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Tumlin v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 88 Ga. App. 713 (77 S.E.2d 555)), he maintains the precedent should be overruled because of precedent from other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We find no error.  The transcript shows that in accordance with the trial court's instructions the alternate juror did not discuss his knowledge with the other jurors, and that there was no opportunity for him to do so since he stated that he did not realize he had information &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[*103]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  about this case until in open court he saw the property and shortly thereafter made this known to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover,  [HN1] in this state &quot;[i]t is too well settled to admit of discussion that a juror is not incompetent to testify as a witness solely on account of having been impaneled and sworn in the case, if he is otherwise competent.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Savannah, Fla. &amp;c.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">R. Co. v. Quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 103 Ga. 125, 127 (29 SE 607). Indeed, &quot;[i]f a juror has any material information or knowledge respecting the facts of a case, of which either of the parties desires to take the benefit, he should be put upon the stand to testify as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  witness.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Chattanooga &amp;c.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">R. Co. v. Owen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 90 Ga. 265, 266 (15 SE 853). See also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Paschal v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 230 Ga. 859, 860 (199 S.E.2d 803).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Jones next asserts the trial court erred by denying his motion for a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[**201]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directed verdict of acquittal based upon the alleged lack of corroboration of his accomplice's testimony.  The transcript, however, shows the evidence was sufficient to corroborate the accomplice's testimony.  Footprints at the scene of the burglary showed two people were involved and that one wore size 11-1/2 to 12 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running shoes and the other appeared to wear boots of an even larger size.  The evidence also showed that the accomplice wore the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that Jones' nickname was &quot;Foots&quot; because of his very large feet.  Additionally, the accomplice's uncle, who was not implicated in the burglary, testified that he heard his nephew and Jones talking about the crime in sufficient detail to reveal his personal participation in the burglary, and also testified that Jones came by his house to see if his nephew had pawned property taken in the burglary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN2] &quot;In Georgia, a defendant may not be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-4-8. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The corroboration must be independent of the accomplice's testimony and it must connect the defendant to the crime or lead to the inference that he is guilty.  However, the corroborating evidence need not of itself be sufficient to warrant a conviction of the crime charged.  Slight evidence from an extraneous source identifying the accused as a participant in the criminal act is sufficient corroboration of the accomplice to support a verdict.&quot; (Citation and punctuation omitted.) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Castell v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 250 Ga. 776, 780 (301 S.E.2d 234). Further, the corroboration may be by circumstantial evidence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Lecounte v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 183 Ga. App. 407 (359 S.E.2d 193). Considering the evidence in this case, we are satisfied that the accomplice's testimony was sufficiently corroborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [HN3] A motion for a directed verdict of acquittal should be granted only when there is no conflict in evidence and the evidence with all reasonable deductions and inferences therefrom demands a verdict of acquittal as a matter of law.  O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-9-1 (a); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Taylor v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 252 Ga. 125 (312 S.E.2d 311).  [HN4] On appeal a reviewing court can consider all the evidence ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Bethay v.

State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 252 Ga. 525, 527 (314 S.E.2d 436).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Review of the evidence in this matter reveals ample evidence from which any rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones was guilty of the offense charged.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c19">Jackson v. Virginia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 443 U.S. 307 (99 S. Ct.  2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560). Accordingly, the trial court did not err by denying the Jones motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Jones also contends the trial court erred by denying his motion for a new trial. As this enumeration of error is based upon the contentions rejected in Divisions 1 and 2 above, it is without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c19">Judgment affirmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN HONG Kong, money rules, OK. One doesn't have to look far to uncover amusing examples of residents' fiery-eyed greed for the folding stuff. Last week, a cursory glance at the business pages of a Hong Kong newspaper revealed the co-ordinator of a team working with Vietnamese refugee children had advertised for volunteer helpers. She received just three replies, all from applicants wanting to know how much the work paid. The newspaper's columnist reflected how this reminded him of the Save the Rainforests campaign run in Hong Kong earlier this year. The campaign chief apparently got a call from a businessman keen to sponsor an acre of rainforest - so he could chop it down and develop the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On street level, the fury with which commerce reigns is blatantly displayed. This is shop city. Store after store, their fat gullets stuffed with merchandise of every imaginable variety, stand shoulder-to-shoulder along main streets, slender lanes, dim alleys and sour-smelling markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the visitor, the effect is so dizzying that caution and carefully edited shopping lists fly out the window, and airlines do world-record business in excess baggage fees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are as many theories on where to get the best buys in Hong Kong as there are shops themselves. Scratch any frequent visitor and they'll give you the name of a special tailor; a gem of a jeweller. Many rave about the night markets - Temple Street on the Kowloon side, in particular. I am not a fan of these noisy nocturnal bazaars, although perhaps I should not be so naive as to imagine a $2 pirate cassette from Temple Street isn't going to unwind into three miles of tape on the first play, or $10 fake Gloria Vanderbilt jeans won't split at the seams if I bend my knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, give me a market where I can try on clothes in front of a mirror and make my purchases in daylight hours when the dazzle from gold-painted fake Rolexes won't cause temporary blindness. My choice for cheap and civilised shopping is Stanley Market, about 15 kilometres from Central on the south side of Hong Kong Island; take a No. 6 or No. 260 bus from the Exchange Square Bus Terminus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will probably be a double-decker, Hong Kong being one of the last outposts for these tall, narrow buses handsomely plastered with advertising for everything from Madame Pearl's magical cough elixir to grime-spattered anti-pollution messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best way to do Stanley is to arrive late morning and settle into a beachfront restaurant for lunch. No use charging about the market on an empty stomach, making rash buys and then wondering how to juggle 25 plastic shopping bags while you take lunch. Along Stanley Main Street are positioned various bars and eating places, the favoured haunts of expatriates on weekends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the restaurants are owned by the same company, New Restfull (sic)Limited, and their names are variations on the Stanley theme. There's Lord Stanley's Bar &amp; Bistro, Stanley's Oriental and Stanley's French, plus the casual snack bar, Beaches. The most upbeat is Stanley's French, on the corner opposite the Hong Kong Bank, and the menu also features Asian dishes and a smattering of peppery Cajun. Be there at the pip of noon for an upstairs window table overlooking Stanley Bay bobbing with pleasure junks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Stanley Market Street, the view of the water gives way to a sea of covered stalls. It's a good-humoured bustling sort of place, free of the sharp smells of a food bazaar, and open from 10 each morning to about 7pm, and even a little later in summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock changes rapidly, but as of last week, there was a thriving trade in the goods mentioned in the following paragraphs. I have quoted prices in Australian dollars, rounding off the exchange rate at $HK6 for $A1. Bargaining is an integral part of business here and will work most successfully if you buy a swag of articles at one store and pay in cash or traveller's cheques. A lot of Stanley's stands do take credit cards, but shopkeepers will try to add between 5 and 10 per cent to your bargained price to cover their commissions, especially for American Express and Diners Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties are $1.65 for a variety of patterns, but you'll have to look hard for preppy spots and stripes between bird-of-paradise colours, poor copies of Hermes designs and subtle motifs like bullfighters and Bart Simpson. These ties are labelled &quot;silk&quot;, though I suspect they're a blend of silk and rayon. But at this throwaway price, who cares? Men's reversible belts are $5, but the gold and silver paint on the buckles does flake. Trays of watches are set up on makeshift stands. Counterfeit branding is illegal in Hong Kong, so close copies of designer models carry names which approximate the originals. For example, Rator-brand pretenders to the Rolex crown are $23.50; these keep time well and will last at least as long as the battery but in terms of style and finish, they're not a patch on the fakes available in Bangkok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the women's blouses, men's shirts and unisex blouson jackets in Stanley's clothing stores are made from talcum-soft washable silk and these are quality bargains. Sleeveless silk blouses in T-shirt style are $9.50, or pay from $32 for stylish short-sleeved models with padded shoulders and good buttons. Long-sleeved silk shirts can be had for $28, and pure cotton business shirts start at $11.50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lined silk blouson jackets range from $55 to $83, but some of the patterns are colourful enough to be viewed from the moon. Zipper-jacket tracksuits made from parachute silk cost $37. Made-in-China cashmere sweaters in pastels and primary colours are $96; buy a size larger than you think you need because the cut is not generous, especially under the arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designed to cut a swathe through any boardroom are two-piece linen women's suits with power shoulders, structured jackets and embroidered lapels. Yours for $240, absolute tops. Obviously one wouldn't take a chance on fit when paying these prices, but the bigger clothing stores in the market have change rooms and full-length mirrors, and can do minor alterations within an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children's clothes are a snip - best buys include denim jackets with cute designs such as Garfield or American baseball team logos for $24. Matching kids' jeans start from $11. There are a couple of toy shops in Stanley displaying a veritable galaxy of Legoland sets - a large fire station, for example, is $59. Hand-held Game Boys are $96, and latestrelease game cartridges start at $38.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polo-style shirts with Calvin Klein labels are an astonishing $2, but the hand-lettered signs on the towering cardboard boxes announce you can't try these on. From my experience, counterfeit Kleins shrink away to something that would fit a Ken Doll if you pass them anywhere near a tumble dryer, so hand-wash in cold water and dry naturally. Ditto for Bossini men's briefs $4at a throw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeans and casual pants are dead cheap. Those Levi's 501s for $50 may be the real McCoy but they're sure to be factory rejects, so look for flaws or dye blotches. The Wonderful Horse Company does a great line in &quot;Comfortable Jordache Basic Expedient Choice&quot; gaberdine slacks for men. For $60, you get the &quot;updated function&quot; line in beige, khaki, navy or black. &quot;This pair of pants,&quot; the label informs, &quot;was once loved by an American hero and makes you as a good officer.&quot; Running shoes are heaps cheaper than in Australia, and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reeboks are the real thing. For teenagers on the cutting edge of the fashion curve, Reebok Pumps and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air high-cut boots are $116 a pair. If you want the price to drop faster than a Michael Jordan slam-dunk, feign shock and walk away - I saved $16 by pleading poverty and threatening to buy a pair of totally uncool alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the large luggage shop, on the left-hand side walking away from the beach, I was crisply informed there are no better prices in Hong Kong. A copycat Samsonite oyster-shell case, 65-centimetre size, is $208. &quot;Of course, that doesn't include special 15 per cent discount for beautiful ladies,&quot;smiled the shopkeeper. Of course. A 76-centimetre Eminent brand black canvas case is $50. I have subjected one of these Eminent models to two years of brutally frequent travel and it shows no sign of wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese chops in mottled shoushan stone are $10 plus $5 for engraving any name in Chinese characters. The little chops are topped with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac; from the display chart, choose the one corresponding to the year of your birth. An engraved chop and red ink pad come splendidly boxed and make an excellent take-home present. Other fun purchases are hand-crafted bamboo and padded cotton Christmas decorations at $4 per pack of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also good buys in the gift line are adult's one-size long cotton dressing gowns with flapping sleeves and tie belt for $10. Short happi coats writhing with embroidered dragons are $14, while Chinese-style silk pyjamas with stand-up collars and frog buttons are $9 for children and $13 for adults. Gary Lee's shop is a treasure trove of hand-embroidered table and bed linen, with prices varying according to the amount and detail of patterns. As a sample, a plainly stitched linen cloth and napkins for a rectangular table seating eight costs $48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Stanley New Street leading to the market from the taxi stand and bus station there's a Watson's pharmacy on the left-hand side. Watson's is a chain operation, the Hong Kong equivalent, if you like, of Boots in the UK, and prices for perfumes and cosmetics are about equal to the duty-free shops at Kai Tak Airport, and sometimes better if there are specials. Lancome and Clarins cosmetics are the same price as the airport; as a couple of examples, 15-millilitre Lancome specific eye cream for $40 and 20-millilitre Clarins eye contour balm for $33.50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For important purchases in Hong Kong - good watches, gemstones, cameras and electronic wares - markets such as Stanley are not recommended. Check out the reputable stores along Nathan Road on the Kowloon side or mega-malls such as OceanCity, and make sure the red sailing junk logo of the Hong Kong Tourist Association is displayed in the shop window. If you do have a complaint, the association can follow up for you through its Sydney office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take a calculator to Stanley to do on-the-spot sums. If you don't have one, pay $5 for a pocket cheapie at one of the stalls. Bargain with bravado, and may your pretend-Polo shirts not shrink nor your American hero pants let the side down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His switch was one of the big factors in South Melbourne's return to top form and its domination in the middle led to a 3-0 win over Melbourne Croatia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsolakis' overall performance was slightly better than the two goals scored by Paul Trimboli and earned him the player-of-the-week title in the scorer with 13 goals last season but has found it more difficult to score in this campaign, with only three goals to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't know the reason but defences are a lot more aware and marking tighter this season,&quot; he said.&quot;But getting stuck on the left wing hasn't helped either as I'm always coming in towards goal from an angle.&quot; Puskas plays with two wingers to get behind defences, so the wide players tend to cut in from near the byline giving them an acute angle to shoot at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsolakis has also been more willing to get involved in physical tussles this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've been battered around a bit in the years I have been playing NSL and I decided to put my foot down and get a bit tougher,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT can one say? The first of the Biology dance parties for 1991 was the biggest event since the 20,000 Leagues New Year's Eve Dance Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biology 3, which raised money for the Open Family Foundation (an organisation that helps Melbourne's homeless youth), was held at the Powerhouse on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first Biology party caught Melbourne's social scene off guard in June 1990, the second was welcomed with open arms in September and this third installment kept a menagerie of stomping baseheads enthralled well into the morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As smoke billowed and strobes flickered, the atmosphere was one of euphoria and the basketball court cum dance floor became a sweatbox of Stussy and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a kaleidoscope of chaotic colors and a pumping mass of avid clubbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest techno house cuts from Australia and overseas were thumped out by 30k of bass and were complemented by bizarre projections and artwork adorning the walls and roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This visual decor was executed by Houdini, V.D.C, Voodoo and Tim Gruchy and proved effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local band Vertigo Hypo performed their techno house bleeps while DJs Mark James, Steve Robbins, Housemaster C from Adelaide and Terrence Ho took a well earned break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fashion saw no limit as overalls, caps, hats, skivvies, chains, berets and an assortment of outrageous costumes were all accepted as the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're a clubbing enthusiast and stomper at heart but missed this event, just hope another Biology party is being planned to head our way in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DESPITE a vicious rumor circulating last week saying Chasers' &quot;Xpress&quot; night was finishing, promotions manager Grant Harrison assures that Friday nights are remaining the same at the Chapel St club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He doesn't know where the rumor started but assures the night is not finishing its year-and-a-half run.He said renovations are taking place upstairs and this may have been the catalyst for the misunderstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Xpress&quot; has proved extremely popular and has seen a wide variety of fresh fads and music become accepted in its time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DJs Paul Seidle and Mark James will keep playing the latest techno house tunes along with Tim Gruchy's chaos videos.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 10-YEAR-OLD Newport boy was held up and robbed of his Reebok runners yesterday by two fashion-conscious bullies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The boy was stopped by two 12-year-old boys as he and a friend were standing at the corner of Hansen St and Mason St about 2.15pm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said the two thieves approached the boys and produced what is believed to be a knife, and ordered the boy to hand over his top-of-the-line Reebok pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said the boy handed them over to the tiny thieves, who were wearing thongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thieves ran to a waiting white early-model Holden station wagon with two black roof racks and a registration number beginning with KJ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the young villians is described as 140cm, with blond hair, fair complexion, slim and wearing a white T-shirt, board shorts and thongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other is described as about 145cm, brown hair, fair complexion, slim with two cross earrings in his left ear. He was wearing an orange and pink T-shirt and black tracksuit pants with green and pink stripes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The theft is part of a disturbing trend of muggings for expensive sports shoes in Melbourne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quest for the shoes has included at least five attacks over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trend developed from the graffiti gangs of the United States and Sydney and has seen expensive runners and basketball boots, particularly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok, sought by thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the shoes are more expensive than those locally-produced because of tariffs, making them more prestigious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy and scandal have a way of attaching themselves to sport, just as entrepreneurs do with Labor Governments, and in the three Olympic Games I attended between 1980 and 1988 I saw three rippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Australia you heard the sanitised versions, now I think it's time for the truth about administrative bungling, poor managerial policy and, of course, Ben Johnson and Seoul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Casting my mind back 11 years should be difficult but the day a Soviet official cost Aussie triple jumper Ian Campbell an Olympic gold medal is still ultra clear. I trained with Campbell as a youngster and owe him plenty for my later international successes.He was the consummate professional and during the lead-up meeting in Europe it was obvious he was going to be hard to toss in Moscow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campbell jumped a distance that I have no doubt would have won him the gold medal in front of Soviet Jaaque Udmae. Amid the jubilation that Australia might win its first triple jump gold medal the red flag went up and Campbell was called for scraping. This means that during his step phase one leg touched the track - a distinct disadvantage but illegal just the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Needless to say Campbell was furious, a protest was lodged and this really was where it went from controversy to scandal. Australian officials asked to see film of the jump. I saw the film and in slow motion it was clear that no contact was made, therefore the jump was legal. Great news, or so we thought.The technical committee was not convinced and it was going to need some strong debating from our management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many other countries, including the British, pledged support and the groundswell was enormous.So what did our officials do? They wimped it.It was early in the games and they thought the ensuing struggle would have upset Australia's credibility and affected team morale. Nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us not forget that later in the games they allowed the gates at each end of the stadium to be opened, creating an unfair advantage for the Soviet javelin thrower. What of Campbell? He is now the European promotions manager for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but athletically I think it all ended on the tartan in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years later I jumped on the plane ready to kick butts in Los Angeles. I could not help but think that the Americans would not be past pulling similar stunts if they could get away with it. But hopes were high and controversies well out of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At our training camp in San Jose the captain's curse hit. It seems all Australian team captains are dogged with poor luck and Rick Mitchell was no exception.He injured a leg muscle and in the ensuing weeks was battling to prove his fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of Mitchell's silver medal effort in Moscow there was enormous pressure on management to include him in the individual event alongside Darren Clarke and Bruce Frayne. Mitchell's efforts to get fit were heroic and in a lead-up meet in Mt Sac he beat Gary Minihan, his only other competitor for the spot, and naturally thought he would be included.Management of our team had other ideas and thought Mitchell's form would barely see him through the first round. It left the decision very late and in the end time ran out. Mitchell's dream of making three Olympic finals was ruined and he blamed the team management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I remember returning after a night celebrating my Olympic medal, it was 2 or 3 in the morning and Mitch was sitting outside on his own. I asked if he was OK, but he didn't answer. Inside it was chaos, Mitchell had given an ultimatum: if he could not run the final leg in the relay team he would not run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clarke, Minihan and Frayne were devastated as together with Mitchell they were a big medal chance.Concessions were made and after much anguish and discussion Mitchell was given the anchor leg. It is history now they ran fourth and Mitchell was passed in the final 200 metres by Nigerian Innocent Egbunike. Threats, lack of foresight and weak managerial decisions led to one of Australia's greatest runners first being denied his rightful place and then being forced, in frustration, to possibly cost his teammates a medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I went to Seoul Olympics as team captain and needless to say the curse got me. I tore a quadricep and was forced to comment rather than compete, but boy, was there entertainment. In Seoul the grand-daddy scandal of all hit the Olympic movement. Everyone knows what happened with Ben Johnson, but what people don't know is the shockwaves it sent through the Olympic village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were a lot of edgy people walking around and among them some Australians. I remember sitting in the dining hall and a person coming on the loudspeaker and after the customary couple of taps on the mike said &quot;testing, testing&quot;, a lot of athletes headed for the exits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scandals, controversy I've certainly seen my share, but one can only wonder how much we really know.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the Sydney Swans be seen in another jumper next season? Word from Sydney has the Swans planning a new-look guernsey for 1992 to coincide with the club's 10th anniversary in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new look will not necessarily involve a design change, but could see the colours reversed, so the red plays a more prominent role. Sydney is happy to remain the red and whites, but several club administrators believe more red would give the jumper a stronger appearance. I must admit to being a fan of their present jumper design and colour, particularly when comparing it with the hideous outfit worn by their northern neighbours, Brisbane. And, come to think of it, the Eagles and Crows are hardly Beau Brummels in the fashion stakes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will let you judge for yourself which Sydney outfit looks more ferocious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LEFT-arm paceman Alan Mullally has returned to Perth a disillusioned young cricketer. When approached yesterday after a training session to ready himself for a club game with South Perth today, Mullally said he had nothing against the Victorian players, but was disappointed certain guarantees had not been kept by Bill Lawry, who lured him over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked if he had been guaranteed a number of Shield games for Victoria this season, Mullally's reply was affirmative. &quot;Yes, in a conversation with Bill Lawry (Victoria's cricket manager) before I moved.And a job that was supposed to be lined up fell through,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mullally played in Victoria's dismal first-up showing in Brisbane against Queensland, was 12th man for the second match against NSW before getting his marching orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Victorian coach Les Stillman told me 60 per cent of my deliveries in Brisbane had been wicket-taking balls yet that was my last chance,&quot; Mullally said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he has played a game with Victoria this summer, Mullally will not be available for WA until next season.On April 2 he will fly to England for his second season of county cricket with Leicestershire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADIDAS has sacked the Sydney Swans as one of its AFL representative clubs, leaving the Swans and Fitzroy the only two teams without boot sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Long-serving Adidas man Ted Whitten, who immortalised the phrase &quot;We stuck it up 'em&quot;, confirmed last night the famous three stripes no longer would provide their product for Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whitten met a delegation of Sydney players last week, headed by Greg Williams and Dennis Carroll, but closed negotiations after refusing to agree to their terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams is expected to wear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boots in 1991, but the rest of the Swans will have to work out their own contracts or buy their own boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The football boot situation with clubs has become increasingly confusing. For instance, Diadora looks after Footscray, North Melbourne and Brisbane, except for the Bears who wear over size 12 as the company does not make boots in those sizes. (Captain Roger Merrett takes a size 14, so he probably will wear an Adidas boot, possibly with the stripes blackened over).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Puma sponsors Collingwood, Richmond, West Coast, and Hawthorn - at least, all Hawk players except Dermott Brereton, who has a highly paid contract with Adidas. Slightly confusing, you must agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIG WES Fellowes, without a senior game at Victoria Park in 1990 and fast approaching his 30th birthday, will be picked up in the AFL's internal draft on Wednesday, March 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the Brisbane Bears decide to draft the big fella they can forget all about him pulling on one of their jumpers and the same goes for the other interstate clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellowes, who is training at VFA club Prahran under former Magpie teammate Brian Taylor, refuses to leave Melb$ourne even if it means an end to his 103-game career in the AFL. If he is not drafted by an interstate club, do not be surprised if St Kilda names him. The Saints would like Fellowes to release Paul Harding to a ruck-roving role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harding enjoys more mobility than most big men in the competition, but lacks a few vital centimetres in centre bounces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE subject of ruckmen, Richmond has high hopes for Ty Esler, drafted from Kooweerup in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Esler - who answers to &quot;Lurch&quot;, and there is a certain similarity as our picture shows - stands 206cm (6' 9&quot;) and will play as the Tigers' No.1 ruckman against Fitzroy at VFL Park at 10am today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good judges at Tigerland say Esler, 19, has been doing well in the pre-season and is a real chance to take some of the workload from the broad shoulders of &quot;little&quot; Mark Lee (199cm) and David Cloke (196cm).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BRYAN Martin's call of yesterday's Blamey Stakes confirmed this writer's impression that he is the best in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For someone who is tied to a desk on Saturday afternoons, Martin's highly descriptive and accurate call was the next best thing to being there, and it came hot on the heels of his memorable call of Better Loosen Up's last race win in the Japan Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As someone who has been a sometime critic of race callers, it is a pleasure to hear Martin continuing the tradition established by callers such as Ken Howard, Bill Collins and Bert Bryant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian athletes are eagerly looking ahead to this year's world championships in Tokyo and next year's Olympics in Barcelona, particularly Lisa Martin-Ondieki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin-Ondieki is returning to Australia from the United States to train in Canberra with coach Dick Telford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She will bring four-month-old daughter Emma and husband Yobes Ondieki, the Kenyan distance runner, with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reasons for the move are to be with Telford and to be closer to her good friend Robert de Castella, with whom she will be able to train.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin-Ondieki has been an enigma in Australian athletics for more than a decade. Her recent results are outstanding, but her early career was littered with disappointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She started off running 110-metre hurdles with limited success and progressively moved up through the distances until she began having some success on the roads and on the track over 10,000 metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once she ran her first marathon it was obvious her talents lay there and after a promising finish in Los Angeles she went on to win gold at the Edinburgh and Auckland Commonwealth Games and a silver medal at the Seoul Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supported by shoe giant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> she has done very well. But together with several incidents this has not made her popular with other Australian athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the rest of the team before the Los Angeles Olympics were made to go to a training camp in San Jose, de Castella and Martin trained elsewhere coming in only on the odd day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I thought this was reasonable considering the nature of their event and the pressure de Castella was under, but in Martin-Ondieki's case it was the first in a series of snubs to the Australian athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following year Martin-Ondieki returned to Australia to compete at the World Cup in Canberra over 10,000 metres and this time stayed with the Oceania team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, before a race she prefers to be on her own, but I know that in Canberra in 1985 her lack of participation in team activities alienated her further from her teammates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the 1986 Commonwealth Games the Australian team stayed in Belgium in a motel. It was hot and there was no air conditioning, millions of mosquitoes and a sewerage outlet 40 metres from the rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ron Clarke made scathing criticism in an article that a national team should put up with this. Times were tough, but it made the team close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin-Ondieki also was in the same area, but she stayed in an apartment with her then husband and coach, Ken Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She would show up at the track to train, Ken would speak to the team officials and then she would leave. This behaviour did not go down too well with athletes and many snide remarks were exchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debbie Flintoff-King, Glynis Nunn, Chris Stanton and many others sweated it out and it was not wise to be so aloof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Seoul, Martin-Ondieki and many others did not stay in the village, but she spent some time there and I thought began to be part of the team. She contributed at meetings and looked as if she finally would take an active role as a senior athlete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years later in Auckland Martin-Ondieki and coach Telford probably unwittingly did a great deal of damage to her relationship with her fellow athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the games they made a great fuss and a few threats over Martin-Ondieki's wishes to stay out of the village with her fiance Yobes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this achieved was a dogmatic stance by the Commonwealth Games Association which nearly cost many other athletes the hard-won privilege of spending nights out of the hustle and bustle of a village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my opinion, if Lisa Martin-Ondieki wishes to prepare alone, so be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is a world-class performer and knows what she wants. It will be good for track and field and its commercial viability that Athletics Australia will have another linchpin to rely on in the next two years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had saved $130 from his paper round to buy his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> runners, which he said had brought him luck at a weekend athletics championship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and a friend, Leigh, were on their way home from school on Monday when they were confronted by three youths wearing baseball caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The youths threatened to stab them unless they gave up their runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John said he had first noticed the trio while travelling home from school on the tram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was with four friends on the tram and these three guys kept staring at our shoes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Leigh and I then moved seats, but the three of them sat in our old seats.&quot; John left the tram at South Melbourne station with Leigh to get away from the trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the three quickly ran after them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We started running, but they caught up to us and yelled 'Stop or we'll stab you',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John and Leigh were forced to remove their shoes and stood helplessly as the three offenders escaped with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John's runners had served him well at the National Little Athletics Championships on the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He only bought them on Thursday night and came second and third in them in the championships,&quot; said his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;John has size 12 feet so I don't know if they will fit any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He probably won't get them back and if he ever did they would probably be ruined.&quot; According to Mrs Stripeikis, police said it was the first time they had heard of youths snatching popular brand name runners in the South Melbourne area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE AFL Players' Association will defend any player who breaks a club footwear sponsorship agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But AFLPA president Justin Madden today said a fine line existed between players wearing boots for medical reasons and &quot;antagonistic&quot; footballers interested in a marketing benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madden's comments follow Melbourne defender Sean Wight's refusal to wear adidas boots in the Demons' reserves clash on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Essendon ruckman Simon Madden and two other Bombers also face fines for being photographed in non-adidas footwear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There have been cases where players are photographed not wearing the sponsor's footwear where it has been their own fault and fines have been imposed,&quot; Madden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But for others, there is no use wearing the sponsor's footwear if it does not benefit the player. Footballers live on their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A number of players at many clubs cannot find the appropriate footwear, find another brand and disguise it. We know that goes on.&quot; The Bombers are not expected to take a hard line with Simon Madden for wearing blade boots in Saturday's clash with North Melbourne at Windy Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Essendon general manager Roger Hampson today referred to &quot;unusual circumstances&quot; surrounding Madden's decision not to wear adidas boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he stopped short of clearing the veteran Bomber of blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bombers face a &quot;please explain&quot; meeting with adidas later today over Madden's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have a sponsorship agreement with adidas and all players are aware of that,&quot; Hampson said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They were highly unusual circumstances that took place on Saturday and I believe it is all a storm in a teacup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I won't go into the matter any more.&quot; Simon Madden today refused to comment, but it is believed he wore the boots to help aid his ruck work in the boggy Windy Hill centre area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adidas national sports liaison manager Ted Whitten will meet with Hampson and football manager Kevin Egan later today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bombers face a fine of $6000 or a review of adidas's sponsorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We'll be asking for an explanation from the club and from Simon Madden,&quot; Whitten said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'll be asking them why the players chose to wear boots that were not adidas.&quot; Whitten was outraged when three players were photographed wearing non-adidas apparel in the past seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adidas sponsors Essendon, Melbourne, Geelong, Carlton, Adelaide and StKilda for about $60,000 each.A player seen wearing non-adidas apparel draws to his club a fine of $2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bomber duo Craig O'Brien and Mark Harvey were photographed last week wearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> runners during a training session at the Tan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whitten was incensed to learn veteran Madden was wearing blade boots, disguised as adidas footwear, in last Saturday's clash with North Melbourne at Windy Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Essendon has always been quite happy with adidas boots,&quot; Whitten said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Simon Madden has worn adidas boots throughout his brilliant career.&quot; The blade boots, also worn by Fitzroy's Richard Osborne, were designed by David Miers to reduce knee injuries in sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Hawthorn ruckman and Herald-Sun columnist Don Scott experienced a sense of deja vu when the boots row broke over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott incurred the wrath of the Hawthorn administration throughout the 1970s when he wore Tiger and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, rather than Puma and adidas boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is the first time the boot issue has raised its head in 15 years,&quot; Scott said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no doubt that the club and adidas have an argument as far as breach of contract is concerned.But so has the player. What about breach of free trade?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy follows another weekend row involving Melbourne and defender Sean Wight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Melbourne's match committee will meet today with defender Sean Wight who refused to wear adidas boots and play in Saturday's reserves' match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wight was warned by club officials before a reserve clash he could not wear boots made by Patrick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wight refused to play and stormed from the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demons' football manager John Sell said he would be talking with Wight this afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't heard from him (since Saturday), but the match committee will be talking to him tonight,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aided by a strong tailwind, Lewis stamped his mark as the man to beat in the glamor event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the tall two-time Olympic champion's run will not be credited as the world record as the 4.3 metres per second wind was more than the legal maximum of 2.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewis's time was second to his own record wind assisted run of 9.78sec set at the US trials in Indianapolis three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday he heralded some fire-works on the sprint track by leading Britain's European champion Linford Christie (9.90sec), who equalled the world record set on June 14 by America's Leroy Burrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia's Frankie Fredericks also bettered the world record with his second round 9.89sec but had a 4.1 tailwind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burrell, however, appeared to relax and enjoy the ride in the last 45m, yet still clocked 10.11sec - with a legal tail breeze of 1.5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was equalled by the smoothly efficient Jamaican Ray Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Hayes' stadium record of 10.05sec, which has stood since the 1964 Olympic final, has survived another day, albeit because of the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewis and Burrell have put aside their friendship to get on with winning the glamor event at Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two were business-like at their first meeting at the track yesterday morning, did not acknowledge each other and warmed up separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewis is not staying in the village where the other athletes reside but in a luxury Tokyo hotel, usually reserved for movie stars, paid for by his sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewis also has declined to acknowlege the US team's uniform sponsors, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by leaving its logo off his team warm-up suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW ZEALAND'S diminutive Finance Minister Ruth Richardson wowed Wall Street last week with an impressive presentation that had little to do with her country's comparative international clout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passing through New York a month before her Australian counterpart, Ms Richardson spoke at length about her Government's fiscal reform and deregulation of the labor market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She happily told bankers and investment specialists that her Government was the maker of economic miracles, while the country's high unemployment was the fault of her political predecessors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are impressed,&quot; one American analyst told a smug Ms Richardson, who conceded she ought to consider retirement now while she was at the peak of her political career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few thousand unemployed Kiwis would probably agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WARREN Buffett, the savior of Salomon Brothers, has little time to contemplate the impact of his performance right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally a nine-to-fiver, the Omaha billionaire has been working around the clock to clear the company's tarnished reputation and open its doors to the many regulators clamoring for more information on the securities scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite revelations that the firm is reducing its assets to maintain its liquidity, Mr Buffett is reported to have remained calm. No temper tantrums, irrespective of his ruthless reputation in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He loves to be right,&quot; said his youngest child, Peter, in a recent interview.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shane is one tall order in feet By MARY PRIOR Health Reporter BIG feet have always been a drag for Tassie Devils' forward Shane Froling, and it is no wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 199-centimetre (6ft 6in) tall basketballer has had size 13 feet since he was just 13 years old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My feet stood out like flippers and I always got loads of flak,&quot; Froling said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was relieved when they stopped growing but he has continued having trouble getting shoes his size - all of which makes him an ideal personality to kick off National Foot Health Week today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 105 kilograms and playing basketball more than 20 hours a week, the 24-year-old said he wore out a pair of $200 to $300 basketball boots about every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm lucky though because I'm sponsored by [sports shoe manufacturer] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and get my boots for free,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a necessity to have good shoes which absorbed shock and gripped the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he still had problems when he wanted casual shoes. They had to be ordered and delivery could take anything from three weeks to two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Froling has had a host of foot problems, ranging from a stress fracture of the toe to a couple of bouts of tinea and an inflamed nerve (Morton's neuroma) in one of his feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His foot specialist (podiatrist) even prescribed an arch support for him because of the neuroma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's not surprising that he thinks his feet are very important and should be comfortable at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hobart podiatrist, who spoke on behalf of the Tasmanian Podiatry Association but would not be named, said it was important to detect and treat foot problems early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People took an average of 700 steps each day and travelled more than 120,000 kilometres in a lifetime, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many painful foot problems experienced in adult life originated from mechanical imbalances in growing children's feet and legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since most of the imbalances were controllable in children it was desirable to have regular foot checks during growing years - particularly if there were any abnormal gaits or shoe patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To mark National Foot Health Week, members of the Tasmanian Podiatry Association will examine children's feet for free at the Northgate Shopping Centre, Glenorchy, on Saturday from 10am to noon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis and Burrell fight for m ore than honour in Zurich Zurich LEROY BURRELL and Carl Lewis will clash again tonight in Zurich in a 100-metre showdown that could be the highlight of the grandest track and field meet on the Mobil Grand Prix circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a tidy budget of $3.4 million, meet director Mr Andreas Bruger has spared no expense in recruiting the world's best talent for his five-hour show at Letzigrund Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Burrell, Lewis, and Britain's Linford Christie in the men's 100 metres, Bruger also has Jamaica's 100-metre sensation, Merlene Ottey, returning to the track where she ran the 200 metres in 21.66 seconds, the third-fastest performance of all time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrell supplanted Lewis, his Santa Monica Track Club teammate, as the world record-holder in the 100 metres when he won the US Outdoor Championships on June 14 in 9.9 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrell shook off a poor start to beat Lewis again three nights ago in Malmo, Sweden. Burrell's time was 10.06 seconds, Lewis's 10.13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's meet will be the last major competition before the world championships in Tokyo, and should reveal much about the gold medal chances of athletes such as Burrell and Lewis, who are scheduled to compete there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruger is offering a kilogram of solid gold to the team that can break the world record in the 400 metres relay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruger has sweetened the pot even more by offering $15,400 for a victory and $19,200 for a world record, in addition to whatever the gold is worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, in Monaco, the Santa Monica foursome of Mike Marsh, Burrell, Floyd Heard and Lewis tied the world record, set by France a year ago. The Americans were timed at 37.79 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's cast also includes Sergei Bubka, of the Soviet Union, fresh from his 28th revision of the world record for the pole vault, in Malmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At considerable improvement to his bank account, Bubka became the first man to pole vault 20 feet outdoors, an achievement that rewarded him to the tune of $64,000 from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> his principal sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bubka is expected to shoot for the next metric notch on the world-record ladder, an elevation of 6.11 metres, which will probably earn him another $64,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this season, when someone suggested Bubka was living too luxuriously for a Soviet athlete, he replied: &quot;Why does everyone ask me what I earn? Nobody makes a fuss over what Carl Lewis gets. Just because I'm a Soviet, everyone expects me to live like a tramp.&quot; Four nations are preparing a motion to put to the International Athletics Federation calling for tougher drug bans, New Zealand's delegate, Mr Ian Boyd, said in Wellington yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The united approach has the support of IAAF president Primo Nebiolo but Boyd said it was not clear if he actually supported the proposed four-year ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Nebiolo had told British authorities that the united motion could go before the IAAF council meeting as well as the International Congress in Tokyo next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletes testing positive for steriod use face a two-year ban but Britain, New Zealand, Ireland and Canada want that extended to four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time the issue was debated in 1989 a tougher approach was defeated, but Boyd said the chances of achieving a longer ban were better this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have more support now than when it was last put - when we gained 40 per cent of the votes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Adelaide teenagers Bill Gordon and Jason van de Merwe it's not getting from A to B that counts, it's how good you look along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From their cropped haircuts and trendy Oakley sunglasses to their surf gear and expensive Reebok running shoes, the Pulteney Grammar students are what every marketing firm dreams of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They did not just pay $150 for fashionable footwear; they admit they bought status symbols.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You've got to look good,&quot; said Bill, 17, of Fulham Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why? &quot;Girls,&quot; said Jason, 16, of Eden Hills, who says leaving the laces undone completes the look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pair were responding yesterday to a survey in this month's issue of Choice magazine, published by the Australian Consumers Association, which rated runners under $40 almost as highly as those that cost $160.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says shoppers may be choosing expensive shoes because of market hype.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Price is not necessarily a guide to features such as comfort, shock absorption, stability or flexibility,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choice asked Australian Olympic pentathlete Alex Watson to test 12 pairs of running shoes ranging in price from $34 to $160 over a 10km course covering bush trails, hard road, hills, sand, dirt and mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although prices varied widely, all 12 pairs rated highly. Of the shoes tested, the Dunlop KT 26 which retails between $34 and $60, was found the best value for money for casual runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For runners who cover longer distances, recommended purchases could all be bought for under $100: Puma XR, Saucony Freedom 1000, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aircraft and Brooks Rage Hydroflow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Rebecca Arthur, a manager of specialist sporting goods store Athletes Foot, said a lot of people shopped for running shoes on the basis of brand names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teenagers especially were under a lot of peer group pressure to buy expensive brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some people who do a lot of activity don't spend enough on shoes and wonder why they get sore feet and back pain,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Others who spend too much get caught in the hype.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although expensive brands were not necessary for casual runners, she said a big outlay could provide motivation for inexperienced athletes to work out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Australian sprinter Miss Lisa Attenborough said casual joggers did not necessarily need expensive shoes unless they had foot problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national sales manager for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr George Ruscuklic, said the Choice survey by only one athlete was &quot;totally inaccurate&quot; and &quot;totally misleading&quot;. The company tested runners in laboratories for &quot;months on end&quot; before they hit the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To say a $34 pair is as good as a $160 pair is an insult to anyone's intelligence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The benefit of runners at the top end of the market was &quot;the longevity of the cushioning system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also helped avoid unnecessary ankle and lower back injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choice said it could not comment if price indicated longer durability. The purpose of all running shoes - cheap or costly - was to protect the foot from injury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a $12,000 armed hold-up at Mitcham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nickname came after police - already alarmed at the spate</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The video shows the unmasked robber strolling into the Hindmarsh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building Society at Mitcham Shopping Centre soon after 2pm on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, and calmly walking the 20m to the end of the counter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to place a black-and-white sports bag in front of a female teller.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sawn-off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shotgun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He appears to say something to another female teller as he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walks in, because she is seen to look across at him and laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the female teller at the counter looks up, the man pulls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out two white plastic shopping bags from his sports bag. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then puts his hand inside the sports bag and produces a sawn-off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the shotgun laid across the counter pointing at the teller,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the &quot;Ice Bandit&quot; is seen to tell her, and two colleagues,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to fill the plastic bags with money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the women quickly grab money from the three counter drawers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and drop it into the plastic bags, the &quot;Ice Bandit&quot; leans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the counter to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not once does he look over his shoulder towards the busy walkway</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outside, nor at the security camera to his right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the drawers are emptied, the bandit calmly tells a teller</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to &quot;hurry up&quot;. He then screws up the bags, throws them into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his sports bag, before slinging it over his shoulder and walking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he does, one of the tellers ducks underneath the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two run into an office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The armed robbery is over within 67 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is no ordinary armed robber. This guy is as cool as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ice. It's hard to believe he was that relaxed,&quot; said a Norwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIB spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's the concerning part, it looks as if he knew exactly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what he was doing, like he had watched over the place for sometime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He chose his moment, the bank was empty. It was all over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and done with before anyone walked in. &quot;We doubt whether he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is local, because he makes no attempt to hide his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Ice Bandit&quot; is described as being about 40 years old,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of muscular to tubby build, 183cm-185cm tall with pale, freckled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skin and wavy, red shoulder-length hair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to take off her joggers until she needs to attend meetings or</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jill McCrimmon, 45, walks or jogs five kilometres from her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Adelaide home to Prospect two or three mornings a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's opened up a whole new way of life for me with discipline,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">motivation, and a general feeling of well-being all the time,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said Jill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Exercise is so important when you're carrying a stress load</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with your job. It's a release that really is beneficial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm up early to get to work by nine o'clock. I get up about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">six, read the paper and get organised, get my shoes on and off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It takes me about half an hour of brisk walking. Often I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walk home when I finish early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've got a pair of flat shoes that are very comfortable and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I tend to wear those. As soon as I get to work or before I get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the door sometimes, I change my shoes and put my other shoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on. It doesn't look right walking into the clinic with my flat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shoes on and a suit with a short skirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Darren Williams, the director of One on One Executive Fitness,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who jogs with Jill a couple of mornings a week says women are</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Men have the attitude that nothing will happen to them,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he said. &quot;Walking is also a very safe activity. It's good for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">burning up calories and getting rid of excess weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says there are a growing number of executive women who keep</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Fiona O'Brien is a firm believer in power dressing for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her neatly groomed hair and carefully co-ordinated outfit and jewellery make obvious her belief in dressing for success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is until you scan down to her feet - where to complete her look she has donned a pair of battered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> runners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs O'Brien, 26, of Dulwich, is one of a small but growing number of women who keep their heels for the office but change to runners for the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She began wearing runners to work about a year ago for comfort and speed during the 30-minute walk to her King William Rd office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I really don't like high heels, but you have to look all right when you're at work,&quot; she said. Her walk to work was motivated by the need to exercise and desire to see a little of the day after being confined in the office for hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I like to do something every day because you do tend to just sit between nine and five,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Margaret Bullock, a private secretary of Rose Park, said she opted to wear runners while walking to work in the city because she was worried about the effect of high heels on her health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd happily wear them (high heels), but I think walking 40 minutes in them to work might do you some (back) damage,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although she was aware running shoes with business clothes looked unusual, she said it did not bother her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It looks funny, but apparently in New York it's really the in thing,&quot; she said. Adelaide City Council's supervisory parking and bylaws inspector, Mr Denis Mills, who spends all day in the city, said he had noticed the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He estimated that about one in 10 women now wore runners with their business clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You see women walking to work from North Adelaide with impeccable business gear on top, and from the ankles down they've got sports shoes and socks,&quot; Mr Mills said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attributed to film</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He attributed it in part to the 1989 release of the film Working Girl, in which Melanie Griffiths wore running shoes to work and then changed into heels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the last year particularly I've noticed it's increased,&quot; Mr Mills said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once upon a time you'd never see them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trend of walking in runners is one which should be encouraged, according to Mr Trevor Jaques, the co-ordinator of the exercise and sports science section of the School of Physical Education at the University of South Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Jaques said high heels changed the body's centre of gravity, so women who walked long distances in them increased their risk of sprained ankles and lower back injuries. &quot;We are designed to walk with our feet flat,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When two vans embark from Christies Downs for Sydney on Sunday, the most important cargo - excepting, perhaps, one diminutive and very fit man - will be a pile of about 30 shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If David Standeven realises his latest ambition and crosses the Doncaster finish line to complete his fourth Westfield Run about nine days after his departure from Adelaide, his success will be largely due to those shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He doesn't intend actually using each of the 12 to 18 pairs he was contemplating taking early in the week. His basic stock for the Westfield is six pairs - all almost new, all </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, together enough to last most of us 20-odd years - and by rights, they should see him through the 6 days he thinks it will take him to cover the 1028km of this year's course.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a man about to run more than 1000km in less than a week must plan ahead. He must worry about having to step through puddles and pebbles and sand, mentally tackle how his feet would best tolerate hot asphalt or torrential rains, so there may be as many as 36 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> piled carefully in one of the two mandatory vehicles he and a back-up crew of eight will drive to Sydney this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this for an event Standeven was not supposed to race. When he completed his last Westfield Run in 1989, earning line honors but not recognition as the winner, the Christies Downs athlete announced his intention to retire. So intense was his commitment to beating the field he had collapsed immediately after breaking the tape, requiring hospital treatment for exhaustion and dehydration; it seemed his body, and more importantly his mind, were telling him they had borne enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it seems even exhausted bodies recover, and well-worn feet get itchy. Standeven last year joined the crew of Victorian Peter Gray, who with the veteran's help became the youngest competitor in the event's history to finish. While happy at being able to assist in Gray's 11th place, Standeven discovered the sidelines did not provide the satisfaction he craved, and the 1990 event was barely over before he declared his intention to line up in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Basically it's a different course,&quot; he said this week in explanation of his decision. &quot;Plus, being a crew member last year and watching everyone run, I found I couldn't sit back and do nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's also the challenge of the handicap system they've introduced this year. It should make the event more interesting, a lot closer and safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standeven - all 160cm and 50kg of him - has been running about 200km a week in preparation for the long haul, and admits doubt as to whether it is enough. In previous years he has considered between 250 and 300km a week the ideal lead-up, but since his decision 12 months ago he has gradually built up to the shorter distance - two hours a day during the week, about six hours each Saturday and Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whether I'm as good as before, I don't know,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I still kept on running before I realy started training, but I won't know if it's been enough until the race starts. I'm feeling pretty good within myself, and although I've been running less, the experience of doing it before helps you get through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When you're out there, it's your mind, your attitude, that gets you through rather than actual fitness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standeven can't pinpoint what has created the motivation that forces him through pain and discomfort towards a finish line hours or even days away. Never an outstanding athlete, he had played soccer &quot;to the best of (his) ability&quot; without ever earning personal awards when, after resting from sport for a year, he stepped out on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was in 1982. Standeven, then 30, started with short distances but quickly advanced to 10km races and marathons, only to recognise that the longer the event, the more successful he was. Five years after he embarked on his jogging campaign he entered his first Westfield Run, achieving what he viewed as the ultimate goal when he managed to finish the 1987 event. The 10th place was a bonus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He bettered that with fifth the next year, then claimed line honors in his third attempt in 1989. The first prize went to Greek Yiannis Kouros, beaten to the line but determined the winner because he started 12 hours after the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kouros is not among the 24 entrants contesting this year's ninth Westfield Run, due to start at 11am on May 15. His absence is expected to give more runners an opportunity to claim line honors and major prize from a total purse of $100,000 for being the first to overcome what is considered the toughest course yet devised, through some of the highest terrain in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The route takes the Hume and Federal Highways from Sydney to Canberra, then deviates via the Monaro Highway to Cooma and along the Snowy Mountains Highway through Adaminaby and past Australia's highest town, Cabramurra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new route winds its way thorugh the Kosciusko National Park, before taking the runners into the Murray Valley, across to Wodonga, and south to Melbourne and Doncaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standeven, who with eight others has been given a 24-hour handicap, realises many less ardent athletes regard him as a madman. Diagnoses of insanity aren't overturned by his inability to explain what it is that urges him on through agony and extremes of temperature, and in fact are probably augmented by his discussion of &quot;relaxing&quot; as he toils through an activity we Norms consider the absolute opposite of relaxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The longer the event, the easier it is to relax,&quot; he said. &quot;Your body tends to cope, and the pain wears away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You think about how you'll tackle each stage, about positive things to keep you going. A lot of time you completely turn off to black out how much it hurts, other times you think about whatever there is to look forward to - like the next meal break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (A meal &quot;break&quot; from his 20-hour day of pounding the NSW and Victorian roads involves him walking instead of running as he consumes a bowl of pasta or spaghetti, washed down by cordial or water. It takes him almost 10 days to return to regular eating and sleeping habits when he returns home, after a week of continuous nibbling energy food and larger meals on the road, and he said he planned to sleep about six hours in total during the run.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Initially my ambition was to finish, but I did that, and then the aim was to win. I don't feel as if I've won one - in the history books Kouros won in 1989, not me - and that's something else to keep me going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But the main thing is to finish, to master the conditions and reach the end. In this race, to finish is to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I always, always have someone waiting for me at the station</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the other end,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures released by the Police Department in its last annual</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">325 occurred on streets, footpaths, laneways and squares, plus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24 on buses, trains and trams and 24 at railway stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the stations, once thriving centres of suburban communities,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand in deserted silence at night - sentinels of 1990's fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lights, empty platforms and the names Millswood, Mitcham, Eden</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same applies on Outer Harbor and Gawler Central routes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPER Elliotts sports store in Rundle St, city, literally has knocked down the walls to make way for new stock, according to proprietor Mr Joe Catterwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, after an 11-year absence, the city store will again stock famous brand clothing and footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the revamping we can get back into it and do a reasonable show,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The return of the clothing and footwear means Super Elliotts has become the most complete sports store in the State without a shadow of a doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This sort of thing is probably unique in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Catterwell said he had only recently signed a contract with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Reebok to supply clothing and footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the extensive range of sports goods most South Australians still associate the store with bicycles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the turn of the century the Super Elliott name in South Australia has been synonymous with cycling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its origins began with making cycle frames and later motorbikes to the stage where Super Elliotts now has one of the largest range of bicycles in South Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Super Elliotts added sporting goods to the bike racks in the post-war years and its three levels in the city store now stock everything from snow-skis and surfboards to darts and billiard balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We knocked down a couple of walls and put in these things called slatwalls so we can display more stock and give people more from which to choose,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The revamp means we have brought it all in together and it looks fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The store renovations have taken a year to complete with the major work only finished in time for the usual busy Christmas period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Catterwell said Super Elliotts catered for every sport imagineable and the counters were staffed by experts in their field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the man behind the counter in the scuba diving section was an instructor while the gunshop was run by a former State clay target shooting champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Catterwell, a sports fishermen and former State-title holder, staffs the fishing tackle counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We always like to have a bit of expertise in the field we are selling in,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expertise which helps Super Elliotts keep in touch with the latest sporting fads while still paying attention to the traditional areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As scuba diving blossomed we entered the market and now we are well respected and recognised in the area,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In darts we are the supplier of most of the pubs, clubs and hotels in the State - in this State we lead the competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, Super Elliotts would not be the same without the rows of bicycles for which it has become famous. More than half the store is devoted to cycles of all kinds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have moved with every trend from the penny farthing to mountain bikes,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have made bicycles, motorbikes and fishing boats until the 1950s when we decided to become the complete sports store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That just goes to show you how much things have changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compressed air is blasted into the chamber and liquid gel flows. These high-tech happenings comprise just one step in the making of today's sports shoes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the beginning, all that was needed was a sole and laces. Now even the laces are disappearing and the shoes are equipped with energy return systems and the soles have air, foam or gel padding systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sale of expensive sports shoes continues to defy the recession, with strong sales for shoes priced between $150 and $200 a pair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- and that is the middle price range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While sales in the rest of the footwear industry slip, sport shoes have become a boom industry, developing an almost cult following, according to some retailers. Body and Sole sports store manager Mr Matthew Usher said teenagers were the main wearers of the shoes, which formed part of the &quot;street kid&quot; look which was becoming popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The shoes have to be top of the range for sport but that's not what they use them for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They just have to get the latest stuff and price does not seem to matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Max shoes, with air cushioning in the heel and sole, cost about $219.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pair of Reeboks equipped with a pump system to fill the shoes with air are about $220 or $300 for the new season styles due out next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Athlete's Foot Adelaide store manager Ms Jo Napier said children usually wore the shoes every day and parents did not mind paying the prices for good shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said teenagers had already been in the store asking about a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoe with fluorescent soles which will retail for about $280.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They can't wait for that one,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Woehlk does not know for sure who murdered his son. He knows a man living not far from him was charged with the crime, and that the charges were dropped. He has a letter from him. The words are small, cramped, in black ink on yellow legal paper:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Mr. and Mrs. Woehlk,<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry to hear what happened to Brett. I wanted to go to the funeral, but couldn't. I had nothing to do with his death at all.  Someday, I would like to talk with you both. Maybe between us, we may be able to find out who did it or had it done. This has been hard for me. . . . And I know it must be hard on both of you. It has almost ruined my life, and for what.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope we can talk someday.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk (pronounced &quot;woke&quot;) keeps the letter in the neat manila folder he has compiled on his son's murder case. The file is thick, organized and incomplete, the way Woehlk's life has been since his son, Brett, 21, was found dead in a field near Lowry Park 11 months ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts Woehlk that the murderer whether it is the man who wrote the letter or someone else is alive and free. He is confused about certain parts of the early police investigation and disappointed in the state attorney's prosecution of the alleged murderer, which was unsuccessful and left everything unsettled.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk, a stoic, disciplined, finish-the-job kind of man, is left with so many loose ends he even went to a psychic for answers. He lives with a fundamental imbalance: He cannot rest until Brett's killer is behind bars, yet he knows that may never happen.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps worse than any of these things was the timing of Brett's death. After years of open-faced conflict, Woehlk and Brett&nbsp; were finally getting along.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many fathers and sons, they were at war from the time Brett a wild, carefree and irresponsible kid was 14. And like many fathers and sons, as Brett neared 20, miraculous realizations occurred on both sides of the barbed wire:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Dad's not so stupid after all.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I've forgotten what I was like as a kid.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they started doing things together: Hunting, going to races, even surfing. Woehlk, 43, had to laugh at himself. He wasn't much for surfing, but Brett wanted to surf, so that's what they did.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Brett started trusting adults, realizing he had to make his own way in the world. He was still wild and crazy, but there was progress.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk was so pleased with his son that he gave Brett his Rolex watch. Woehlk, sales manager at Bolt and Nut, had earned the watch as payment for a construction job many years before. It was very special to him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Brett the watch on his 20th birthday. Brett knew what the gift symbolized. He never took it off.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not on Brett's wrist when his body was found.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett Woehlk who was most likely killed April 2 after leaving work at a Farm Stores convenience mart, autopsy reports say was handsome, cocky and friendly and intensely loyal to his friends. His hair was almost shoulder length, dark with a touch of red. He had a reddish-brown mustache, straight white teeth and beautiful green eyes framed by long lashes. He was 5-feet-6 inches tall, and weighed 135 pounds, but it was &quot;all muscle,&quot; his father says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett had a way with women and took advantage of it. He was agile, a natural water skiier. He loved all water sports illustrated by the surfboard perched over his waterbed in his room. Most of all he liked lounging on the beach. In the Woehlk living room is a photo of Brett sitting shirtless on the beach raising a beer and grinning.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was Brett,&quot; Alan Woehlk says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Woehlk knew his son was no angel. Brett hung around with a tough crowd, basically good guys, but tough they drank, they partied, and Woehlk suspected they used marijuana.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett, two years older than his only sibling, Shannon, was the kind of kid who kept his parents worried, frustrated, furious, or all three.  He skipped high school so often that his dad pulled him out of school; Brett later earned a GED degree. He hated rules, choosing to face consequences rather than forgo fun. Sometimes he lied, not because he was dishonest, Woehlk believed, but because he was irresponsible.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Saturday before he was killed, Brett skipped work to party. He made up an elaborate and later, an ironic lie: His cousin had been stabbed, he told his boss, and Brett was a suspect. He had to sit at the police station all day.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, April 1, the last day anyone saw him alive, Brett showed up for work at the Farm Stores on N Armenia about 6 p.m. He wore Levis, blue-and-white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoes and a T-shirt with the words &quot;Farm Stores&quot; in the upper left shoulder.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a small black-and-white television. He liked to watch The Simpsons and other programs during work. He always took the television home with him, friends say, because he didn't want it stolen.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store closed at midnight. Brett worked at least some of his 6 p.m. to midnight shift, according to friends who talked to him or saw him. But sometime that night, Brett left the store. Whether he finished the shift or left earlier is unknown. Whether he left on his own or was forced to is also unknown.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the television was still in the store the next day.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who reportedly last saw Brett at the store, and who has the most information about Sunday night, is David Mayle, the store manager.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle also is the man who was charged with Brett's murder and who wrote Mr. and Mrs. Woehlk a letter.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami Pipes, Brett's girlfriend, was worried when Brett didn't come home after work early Monday morning, April 2. The two had lived together on and off for the past several months. Jami called some close friends Brett often stayed with. He wasn't there. She drove by the store. He wasn't there. She checked with the Woehlks. They hadn't seen him, either.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, a Tampa Police Department detective knocked on Jami's door. The detective was looking for Brett.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Mayle, the detective told Jami, had reported a burglary from the store. About $ 10,000 had been stolen from the store, cash and rolled coins. Mayle told police Brett filled out deposit slips for Friday and Sunday, but the money never made it to the bank.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, Jami was almost frantic. She told the detective Brett &quot;was missing.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, another Farm Stores employee, James DelValle, who walked to the store most days, called Jami.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just saw Brett's car,&quot; DelValle said. It was at Marquis Apartments, a few blocks from the Farm Stores. Jami went to see the car. The window of the 1983 yellow Toyota was down. A Sunday newspaper was partially opened and stashed in the back of the front seat. There was a pack of cigarettes, which police think were most likely Brett's, an uneaten sandwich and two Farm Stores bank bags.  The bags, which lock with a key, were open and empty. The key was at the Farm Stores, it was later determined.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami knew Brett would never leave his car unlocked; it had an expensive stereo in it. And she still hadn't heard from him which was not like him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jim, Brett's dead,&quot; Jami said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nah, he's drinking Mai-Tai's in Hawaii,&quot; Jami remembers DelValle saying.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DelValle, also a friend of Brett's, had partied with Brett the Friday and Saturday nights before Brett disappeared. He told police and later testified in court that he did not remember seeing Brett take money or bank bags from the store Friday night and that Brett didn't have enough money Saturday to buy a pitcher of beer.  DelValle passed a police polygraph test.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months later, DelValle accidentally shot himself. He died the next day, Nov. 24, 1990 Brett's birthday.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next five days, Alan Woehlk and his wife, Phyllis, crept toward the realization that their son might be dead.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, they tried to tell themselves that Brett went to visit an old girlfriend in Texas. Then, though they did not think Brett would ever steal money, they started hoping he had, just to nurse the hope he was still alive.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Brett's car was found, Alan Woehlk knew something was terribly wrong. By then, he had told the police his son was missing.  But police still suspected Brett had stolen the money. Woehlk pointed out that a guy who had just stolen $ 10,000 doesn't just leave his car like that with cigarettes, newspaper and sandwich. It didn't make sense.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Brett had stolen the money, one of his friends would have known. Brett and his friends were tight-knit. Not one of them had seen Brett.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday afternoon, six days after Brett disappeared, police officers came to search the house for Brett, or for evidence he had stolen the money. I told you, Brett's not here, Woehlk said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, Alan and Phyllis Woehlk watched the 11 o'clock news, along with Alan's parents, Gus and Betty. They listened to the winning lottery numbers. Then they saw a field near Lowry Park. They heard a reporter say a boy looking for insects to feed his&nbsp; snake found a body instead.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Woehlks fell silent.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a brief look at the body. &quot;All they showed was a hand out from under a piece of carpet,&quot; Alan Woehlk recalls.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk tried to stay calm. He called the television station. They had no more information. The next morning, Woehlk reached Detective George McNamara of the Tampa Police Department.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara asked what Brett had worn.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi's, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tennis shoes, Woehlk said. &quot;Is that what this person wore?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but that doesn't mean he's your son, McNamara replied.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I tried to tell him some distinguishing marks,&quot; Woehlk says. &quot;He said, &quot;You can forget that.' &quot; The body was badly decomposed and bloated. An autopsy would later indicate the person had been stabbed, his throat cut.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six days. In the sun. Under a carpet.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We knew it then.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective McNamara almost immediately suspected the store manager, David Mayle. It was common sense: Who had the safe combination? Only Brett and Mayle. Who was left to talk about it?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle already had been fired by Farm Stores on April 6. Farm Stores refuses to discuss this case.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police reports say that Mayle told detectives he was fired because of a company investigation regarding money stolen from his store. A Farm Stores security officer also told police that the Farm Stores had noticed money shortages at Mayle's store about four months earlier. After Mayle was asked about the shortages, they stopped.  There is no indication Farm Stores took legal action against Mayle.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when McNamara investigated the crime scene April 7, he had noticed two men watching from a car. He asked a police officer to get their names. At the time, the names didn't mean much:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Mayle and Paul Delay.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Delay, 34, has lived with Mayle for five years in what the couple describes as a homosexual relationship. On April 9, McNamara asked Mayle and Delay to come to police headquarters.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle told him his side of the story, which has remained unchanged since April. In a recent interview, he did the same:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scheduled to be at the Farm Stores Sunday night to help train Brett, recently promoted to assistant manager. Brett was to take charge during Mayle's upcoming vacation.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the store closed at midnight that Sunday, Brett did all the paperwork for the bank deposit. He'd had trouble with it before.  Mayle checked it over.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He done good,&quot; Mayle says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mayle says, Brett left with one bank bag and the deposit slip, intending to make a night deposit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says he stayed at the store until about 2 a.m. He closed the store and then washed off his car's windshield. A police car stopped by, suspicious. Mayle waved, indicating he worked at the store. He stopped to buy a beer at a nearby 7-Eleven, and then went home, about a 20-minute drive.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says he was tired. He had worked a double shift Saturday, worked Sunday, then met Brett Sunday night and was due in at 4:30 a.m. Monday. He got home around 3 a.m.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Delay woke up, and the two argued about where Mayle had been. Mayle says (and Delay agrees) that Delay is compulsively jealous and had wondered whether Mayle and Brett were having an affair.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay went back to sleep. Mayle took a shower and changed clothes. If he tried to lie down, he would never get up again, he thought. He stopped at the same 7-Eleven for a cup of coffee and went to work.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett was scheduled off Monday. On Mayle's way home from work, he made a bank deposit. He did not pick up the weekend's verified deposits slips from the bank as he usually did because, he says, he was too tired. When he came to work Tuesday morning, the store was locked, but the safe was open and empty. He called the police and told them the money was gone. He said Brett was the only other person who knew the safe combination.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then McNamara interviewed Delay.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a 30-page report written by McNamara, Delay &quot;seemed very nervous . . . had a hard time making eye-to-eye contact&quot; and McNamara thought Delay &quot;was not telling us everything he knew about the disappearance of the subject, Brett Woehlk.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delay talked about the day he and Mayle stopped to watch the crime scene. He said Mayle, McNamara's report states, &quot;became quite upset and would not leave. . . . (he) was very intently watching the police officers at the crime scene.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said the couple barely made ends meet on about $ 1,600 a month, but that Mayle often cruised bar parking lots at night, bringing home money. McNamara asked Delay whether he &quot;actually believed&quot; Mayle had gotten extra money as much as $ 170 one night in parking lots, or whether he may have gotten it &quot;another way.&quot; Delay said he believed the money was found in the parking lots.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detectives talked about Delay's jealousy, his belief that Mayle no longer loved him and had been having an affair with Brett. Delay cried and said he wanted to go home and &quot;confront David,&quot; McNamara wrote in his report.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 12, at 6 a.m., McNamara and other police officers showed up at&nbsp;Mayle's door with a warrant for his arrest. They charged him with burglary and grand theft. Searches turned up a bank bag (from a different Farm Stores) and rolled coins in his car. Police found nothing incriminating in his apartment, but they did take into evidence five sets of keys for Mayle's house and car and old bank bag keys.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara asked Delay to come back to the police station.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at 8 a.m. Questioned for three hours by several detectives, Delay first said he didn't know anything, he didn't remember, then he wasn't sure. He wished they would stop asking him questions. He loved David very much and didn't want him to go to jail.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara and others pushed hard. They repeatedly encouraged Delay to &quot;be completely truthful.&quot; Little by little, Delay cracked, seeming less sure of what he had to say. He said Mayle went to bed for a while before returning to the store, contradicting Mayle's statement that he did not sleep. He was shown a photograph of Brett's stab-torn shirt, then a picture of the body. Had he ever seen dried blood before? Did David have dried blood on his hands that night?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I noticed red blood on his hands and questioned about why is the blood on your hands,&quot; Delay said in a taped statement a little after 11 a.m. &quot;He said that . . . that he was doing the parking lots and all and . . . you know . . . he already had his clothes off by the time I got in the bathroom and. . . .&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said Mayle told him &quot;he took Brett in his car, took him somewhere. I said, &quot;Where?' and he said, &quot;To that, to a lot.' &quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said Mayle told him he and Brett argued about the missing money. &quot;Brett wanted to keep the money, and David fought him for it.&quot; Mayle &quot;wanted money for himself, and David said he had to stab Brett and kill him. . . .&quot; Mayle was afraid Brett would go to the police. Mayle buried the knife near the body and asked Delay to bury his bloody clothes. Delay says he refused. Mayle left the house with the clothes.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle was charged with first degree murder. But Delay soon retracted his statement. He later pleaded no contest to charges of perjury and accessory to murder, and was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years. (Although murder charges against Mayle were dropped, it is possible he is still under investigation. Police have refused to comment.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview Jan. 30 in the men's home, Delay trembled, and he never established eye contact. He says he is a diagnosed schizophrenic. (Psychiatrist James Fesler of Tampa confirms only that Delay is a patient; he says discussing a patient's diagnosis is inappropriate).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay says detectives fed him some details about the murder scene. Other details he already knew from newspaper articles.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was five detectives in the room with me,&quot; Delay says of the police interview. &quot;I was scared. And they knew my weakness.  Mentally, emotionally I can't take pressure.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I went through hell. I don't know what I was saying. I was in a state of shock. I remember saying these things. That's why I turned around and misperjured myself. I knew it wasn't true. I know David's personality. I know he wouldn't do something like that.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked why he refused to establish eye contact during the interview with a reporter, his voice broke, and he stammered, &quot;I just . . . I don't like the whole idea. It hurts me.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grand jury refused to indict Mayle on murder charges after reviewing evidence, including Delay's then-retracted statement. In September, Mayle was quickly acquitted of theft by a six member jury. He never testified. Mayle left the courtroom that day in tears.  The Woehlks left discouraged and disgusted with the system.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police never found any buried knife or bloody clothes. Tests of brownish spots in Mayle's house and other items Mayle owned &quot;met with negative results,&quot; McNamara reported. No blood was found anywhere in Mayle's home or at the Farm Stores. Exactly where Brett was killed has never been determined.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk still believes Paul Delay knows something. He mentioned during his interrogation something about a set of keys he didn't recognize. They were among the keys police later took into evidence.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the keys fit the lock at the Woehlks' house before they changed the lock after the murder.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says there are simple explanations for events that might look suspicious. He says he did not steal money from Farm Stores.  He says Farm Stores wanted an excuse to get rid of him because he had had expensive health problems including back and foot surgery.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who doesn't notice a marked crime scene crawling with police officers? He was just being &quot;nosy&quot; the day he stopped by the field where Brett's body was found. He and Delay had had dinner with friends, and their route took them by Lowry Park. The friends have confirmed this.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If they have any keys other than mine, I don't know where they came from,&quot; Mayle says. He has many sets of keys, and Delay would not have recognized all of them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always carried rolled coins to supply the store, or others, if necessary, he says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was seen (by Brett's watchful friends) with large amounts of cash after the murder, buying lottery tickets at convenience stores near his home. That, he says, was the money he had saved for vacation, about $ 3,000. He has no bank account.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle thinks that police exploited Delay's insecurities, convincing him Mayle no longer cared for him. Mayle, who weighs approximately 350 pounds, says he believes his weight and his homosexuality did not help him.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a victim of circumstance, he says. &quot;You know, you don't plan for things like that. You don't plan an alibi.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle, slow-moving, with a slightly brooding face, says his life has been ruined. He has lost his job, most of his friends and is nearly out of money.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says what has hurt the most is the way Farm Stores dumped him after nine years of service. Mayle had planned to work with Farm Stores until he retired.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he says, he cannot find a job. He works occasionally for temporary services companies.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been watched and called at all hours by Brett's young, angry friends, one of whom recently said of Mayle: &quot;I'd like to put an ice pick in the back of his head.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They was calling me and telling me when I was gettin' on the bus, when I was buying a loaf of bread,&quot; Mayle says. &quot;That makes you scared.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mayle says he has no plans to follow a friend's advice to leave Tampa. &quot;Why should I leave?&quot; he asks. Besides, &quot;If they're gonna do something, it don't matter where you go. So that's why I more or less stood and tried to fight it. I'm not really scared because, I don't know, I have a different thing about death, I guess. Death is a relief, okay? It relieves you of your pains, your misery. If I die, I die. To me, death would mean no more of it.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk keeps channeling his grief into neat files and hard hopes. He has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Nov. 24, the Woehlks visited Brett's grave. It was his 22nd birthday. Several friends had sent flowers. One flower arrangement had no card. The Woehlks still don't know who sent it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rolex watch is still missing. It was stolen, along with Brett's wallet and keys, at the time Brett was killed. The watch is 22 years old, stainless steel, with a black face and small scratch. Woehlk says he would instantly recognize the watch.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has the feeling it will never be found.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Chronology of events v<BR>&nbsp;<BR>v Sunday, April 1, 1990: Brett Woehlk shows up for work at the Farm Stores at 6 p.m., where David Mayle was to train him as an assistant manager. It was the last day he was seen alive.<BR> Monday, April 2: Police say this is probably the day Brett was killed. His girlfriend, Jami Pipes, grows concerned when Brett doesn't come home.<BR> Tuesday, April 3: A detective shows up at Jami's looking for Brett.  He is investigating a report of missing money from the Farm Stores where Brett worked. Mayle has reported the money missing.<BR> Wednesday, April 4: Another Farm Stores employee, James DelValle, who walked to the store most days, calls Jami and reports he has seen Brett's car in the parking lot of some apartments.  DelValle had partied with Brett on Friday and Saturday before he disappeared.<BR> Friday, April 6: David Mayle is fired by Farm Stores. Mayle tells detectives he was fired because of a company investigation regarding money stolen from his store.<BR> Saturday, April 7: Police officers come to search Alan Woehlk's house for Brett. Later that night, a television report says that a body has been found in a field near Lowry Park. Woehlk, suspecting it might be Brett, tries to get more information from the television station, but none is available. Also that day, as Detective George McNamara is investigating the crime scene, he notices two men watching from a car. Their names: David Mayle and Paul Delay, Mayle's companion of five years.<BR> Sunday, April 8: Woehlk calls the Tampa Police Department and describes what his son was wearing. Even though Detective McNamara says he can't be sure it's Brett, Woehlk is sure it is his son.<BR> Monday, April 9: McNamara asks Mayle and Delay to come to police headquarters, where they give their version of the events.<BR> Thursday, April 12: McNamara and other police officers show up at Mayle's door with a warrant for his arrest. They charge him with grand theft. He is never indicted on murder charges.<BR> September: Mayle is quickly acquitted of theft by a six-member jury. Delay had already pleaded no contest to perjury and accessory to murder. He was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Maher's wire-to-win in Tuesday's Harvey's Festival 5-kilometer race came on the heals of some hard workouts.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't taper for the race at all,&quot; said Maher, a member of Canada's Olympic marathon team in 1988. &quot;I'm getting ready for the World Cup marathon in London on the 21st (of April) so I ran 30 miles Sunday non-stop, 15 Monday and even six the morning of the race.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maher, 30, who was raised in County Kerry in Ireland, beat his training partner, Chris Bloor, by 11 seconds in 14:38 and said some nice things about him and the event at the awards ceremony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The crowd is very supportive,&quot; Maher said. &quot;I'd like to see the course run through the spectators the whole way. That would be an&nbsp; incentive to the runners.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leanne Larison, 23, of Clearwater, won the women's race in 18:11, 11 seconds ahead of Kim Fagen of Eckerd College.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 716 finishers in the 5K, 250 in the mile event and an estimated 50,000 spectators, most of whom had come early for the Illuminated Light Parade.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Easter Bunny Run: Masters, the euphemistic term for runners 40 and over, did exceptionally well at Saturday's Easter Bunny 10K race, from the Clearwater bayfront to the north end of Clearwater Beach.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol Jean Vosburgh, 46, of Seminole and Carolyn Mather, 42, of Tarpon Springs were second and third in the women's division, respectively.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the men's division, masters winner Vincent Hernandez of Tampa was sixth in 35:14 for the 10K distance, followed by Jim Keppeler, 43, of Clearwater in seventh and Bill Calvin, 45, of St.  Petersburg, in ninth. There were 582 finishers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does age affect performances in competitive long-distance running?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot,&quot; said Joe Burgasser, veteran coach of the Forerunners club of St. Petersburg. &quot;Our heart rate slows down one beat per minute per year over age 35 and that affects how fast our lungs can process oxygen. Also, recovery time: muscle fibers don't recover from workouts as fast as with younger runners.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun Run: Lisa Vaill, 28, of Brooksville, was third overall in a field of 175 at Saturday's Sun Run in Spring Hill. Her time for 10K was 35:27. Leanne Larison of Clearwater was the second woman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall winner was Bob Marchinka, 19, a track runner from Cleveland State in the area on spring break. His time was 32:49.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly rankings: The criteria for the St. Petersburg Times' ranking of the top runners in the area include: a minimum of three races; full-time residence; and competitive race results over a range of distances.

Second is Carolyn Mather of Tarpon Springs, a member of the Boston Athletic Association.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gasparilla Distance Classic served as the primary race in establishing these rankings, although all races count. Similarly, the Times' Bay to Bay 7.5-mile race on May 6, which attracts most of the area's top runners, is an important race on the schedule.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes: Dan Landry, repeat winner of the Passing for Sane 50-miler in February, has been selected for the U.S. team competing for the 100K (62.2 miles) World Cup in Florence, Italy, on May 5. &quot;It's a great honor to be selected to represent America's ultra community,&quot; said Landry, 38, president of the Suncoast Runners Club.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim DeBoy, 32, of St. Petersburg, won the Rotary Club's Lake Seminole 5K in 16:51. Sonny Gessner of Largo was the runner-up in 17:15. Nancy Reling, also of Largo, was the women's winner, squeezing out a three-second win over Terry Affleck in 19:59. It was her first time under 20 minutes. Reling also won her age division, 25-29, at the Easter Bunny Run in 43:31. Brianne Harrington, 11, a sixth-grade student at St. Jude School in St. Petersburg, won the women's mile race at the Armadillo in Oldsmar. The feature event, a 10K, was won by Tom Swiersz in 31:34, three seconds ahead of Tampa's Ronnie Holassie. Leanne Larison had a two-minute margin over Linda Mason in the women's division winning in 37:34.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon Hawkins of Madeira Beach broke the state record for a 24-hour run Sunday by logging 116.25 miles on the track at St.  Petersburg Catholic High. Eileen Eliot of Fort Lauderdale was the&nbsp; first woman with 114 miles.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the voice that is surprising soft, slurry, a half-asleep whisper.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Black people kissing on screen? I never saw that growing up.&quot; He says this staring out the editing booth watching a print of his new film, Jungle Fever, run over and over, the images of a black man and a white woman reflected in his glasses.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a performance a mastery of the deadpan as he has put it as integral to the Spike Lee persona as the wire-rims, a baseball cap and sneaker. Behind the glasses, his eyes are enormous, impassive.  His body, a spindly afterthought ending in the soft padding of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The intermingling of the races? That's always going to be a part of my work,&quot; says the country's pre-eminent black American film-maker, staring at the screen in a sound stage at Manhattan's storied Brill Building. &quot;That has happened since the slaves were brought here stolen from Africa when massa started sneaking in the slave quarters at night. That's the dynamics of color and race.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently watches a few more frames. Suddenly he throws his head back and laughs, a short, raucous burst. &quot;There's one thing that black men have that really threatens white males.&quot; To paraphrase Lee, it is the notion of a black male's sexual prowess.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask anyone who knows him and to a man they will tell you, Spike Lee is a troublemaker. His films She's Gotta Have It (1986), School Daze (1988), Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990) and now, Jungle Fever, the much anticipated look at interracial romance that opens Friday have been sharp, repeated blows to the Hollywood axiom that black doesn't sell. Not in white America.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not anymore.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the director's works black American cultural themes married to a cinematic style drawn from Martin Scorsese, Japan's Akira Kurasowa and the French New Wave filmmakers has made money. And each has generated equal currency from the media that addresses Lee's films as annual missives from the front lines of cultural politics.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Do the Right Thing opened two summers ago an examination of racism in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood that seemed to advocate violence as a means of social reform the movie generated segments on Nightline and several evening newscasts when critics and civic leaders predicted the film would spark riots. For every reviewer like Vincent Canby of the New York Times who hails Lee's work as &quot;social phenomena&quot; from &quot;a major American filmmaker in dazzling command of his craft&quot; there are those who consider him simply &quot;an annual media sensation,&quot; as Time's Richard Schickel has written.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is the most influential black American director working in Hollywood today, one who is making his movies, albeit low-budget by most studio standards, on his terms. His films have expanded the boundaries of the country's popular culture, altered Hollywood's perception of crossover audiences, and opened the door for a new generation of black American male directors the Hudlin Brothers, Robert Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Bill Duke among them who are redefining the roles that African-Americans play on screen and within the industry.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is he so successful? How about &quot;He is really talented, a good filmmaker,' &quot; says Tom Pollock, chairman of MCA Motion Picture Group where Lee has made his last three films under an unusual picture-by-picture arrangement that grants him total artistic control. &quot;He is a serious filmmaker no different from where Scorsese was after five films.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African-American studies at Harvard University, calls Lee &quot;one of the most important figures in African-American culture. He is doing what nobody has done in film depicting what W. E.B. Dubois called &quot;the life behind the veil,' what black people do when white people aren't around.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee suggests that &quot;it's a combination of everything part talent, part luck, part timing. I'm not the first talented black filmmaker to appear on the face of the earth. If I had come along 20 years ago, the conditions weren't conducive to this kind of success.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, he is not the first significant African-American director.  Melvin Van Peebles, Gordon Parks, even actor Sidney Poitier are among those who predate Lee by a generation or two. Now, the Brooklyn-based director is one of several talented black American directors Hollywood is courting.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 34 and with five films to his credit, Lee has become something of the group's power base; he remains the first to employ what some have called &quot;a post-integration sensibility&quot; one who is not making films to simply uplift the race.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dozens of black Americans have directed films before,&quot; says Roger Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times. &quot;But the subtext of those movies was always how blacks related to whites. Spike broke through that. He defines blacks in relation to other blacks.  That is brand new.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even critics who dislike his artistry agree that Lee, a graduate of Atlanta's Morehouse College and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, is the first director to package parochial racial themes and issues delineating economic, gender and class distinctions that segment of life between The Cosby Show and the crack houses in a commercially viable vehicle.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's Gotta Have It, Lee's first feature film, shot for $ 175,000 in 16mm, explored sexuality from the unusual perspective of a liberated black American woman. School Daze probed such seldom-discussed intraracial issues as the clash between light-skinned and dark-skinned black Americans. Do the Right Thing exhumed racial bigotry and class hatred among New York's underclass. Mo' Better Blues&nbsp;chronicled the lives of middle-class jazz musicians.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Jungle Fever, which features Wesley Snipes, Anthony Quinn and Annabella Sciorra, explores interracial relationships. Some critics are already speculating that the film, which is dedicated to Yusuf Hawkins, the black youth murdered by a gang of whites in New York two years ago, could prove as controversial as Do the Right Thing. Meanwhile, Lee is already in pre-production on his most ambitious film to date the coveted Malcolm X project, a film about the black nationalist leader, with a budget that may reach $ 30-million.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions, however, that Lee's standing within the film industry and the black American community is due less to his talents as a moviemaker than his shrewd entrepreneurial instincts and acute political sensibilities that embody, more than any other African-American director, the country's interest in racial issues.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee's cultural politics, evident in his films and frequent public statements he once described himself as &quot;a black Nationalist with a movie camera&quot; have capitalized on the growing appreciation of Malcolm X, earned the support of such divergent political leaders as Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan and captured much of the public outrage voiced after recent racial incidents.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee has firmly positioned his career at that thorny crossroads of art and publicity and his off-screen activities have earned him almost as much note as his films. An outspoken social critic, Lee has publicly attacked Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and Quincy Jones as sellout crossover artists.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He criticized several Hollywood directors, including Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood, for making films about black Americans. He called Edward Koch, then mayor of New York City, a &quot;racist&quot; and said he hoped Do the Right Thing would defeat his bid for re-election. When the film lost at Cannes that year, he accused the festival jury of racism, and when he lost out in May to the unheralded Barton Fink directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, he vowed never to return to the festival.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee has buttressed his pronouncements with growing financial clout. He is the only black American filmmaker to mass-market himself the way entertainers such as Eddie Murphy, Prince and Michael Jackson have.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his film company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Lee owns Spike's Joint, a lucrative retail and a mail-order business that merchandises books, tapes, T-shirts and other apparel related to his films.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you don't own stuff you have no power,&quot; says Lee. &quot;For me that's the whole issue. When black people start thinking more like entrepreneurs instead of just consumers, then we will have a whole lot more empowerment. Instead of &quot;Please Mr. White Man, can you do so and so for me,' we will call the shots.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for every critic or studio head who hails Lee as a genuine pioneer, there are those who insist he is neither a talented filmmaker nor a serious social critic, that the racial and economic situations of his films are exploitative particularly of African-American women and the film's political positions are undercut by a fatal, commercial-driven, ambiguity.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been called a huckster by some critics and artists both black and white Americans who attribute his success to his low-budget &quot;boutique&quot; standing within Hollywood and the indulgence of a predominantly white media. Others have labeled Lee simply a charlatan, the &quot;Al Sharpton of filmmaking&quot; says Time's Schickel, one who exploits social issues for his own ends.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the African-American critical community is divided over Lee's work. While Dr. Henry Louis Gates, the country's preeminent black American scholar, finds the director a pivotal figure in American culture, Stanley Crouch, the well-known Village Voice critic, has dismissed Lee as a &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;propagandist&quot; without &quot;the courage and will to give racial confrontation true dramatic complexity.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other critics suggest that Lee is falling victim to his own success.  &quot;He is dealing with more significant issues than other black filmmakers,&quot; says Jackie Jones, editor of the Black Film Review.  &quot;But the way he has been packaged as a phenomena, it is discouraging real critical discussion of his films.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One cannot deny that Spike has made a fantastic breakthrough in an all-white enclave. There is no question of that,&quot; adds Jack Kroll, Newsweek's senior critic. &quot;But there is a part of him that is an opportunist, that prevents you from taking him seriously as a true radical. Many black artists look upon Spike with very mixed feelings.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, interviews with dozens of colleagues, employees and friends, past and present, reveal a man who generates some of the same charges of exploitation in his professional and personal relationships, that for all his success at the box office, Lee's standing within the black American film community is several notches below other, less-influential directors such as Robert Townsend, a much-liked Hollywood director.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several producers, actors and investors who have worked with and for Lee say that the entrepreneurial shrewdness shown in his dealings with those more powerful than himself has not translated into any trickle-down system for his peers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suggest that after six years in the business, Lee has become arrogant, self-interested, a multimillionaire who under pays artists and employees, and that for all his public support of a new black economic solidarity the director has simply co-opted traditional studio-boss attitudes a vision extending only to his own pocketbook. The most powerful African-American in Hollywood may be the most resented.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spike's single-mindedness is his best and his worst quality,&quot; says Nelson George, a screenwriter, music critic and columnist for the Village Voice and one of Lee's original backers. &quot;He tunnel-visions people out when he doesn't need them and he has not been as visionary as he could be in helping other people's careers.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee, who still lives and works in the same Brooklyn neighborhood where he was raised, is unfazed by the criticism. &quot;I have no conflicts at all, about my success. None,&quot; he says. &quot;Black people should be the recipients of the money that is being generated by black culture.  In the past we were getting flim-flammed, bamboozled. Having talent is not enough. You have to know about royalties. You have to have some business know-how.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee comes across as a complex, driven man who seems to enjoy revealing as little of himself as possible. Friends say that for all his public posturing, he is notoriously shy, a work-obsessed artist who spends hours on the phone, lives alone in his Fort Greene townhouse furnished with a giant editing machine just blocks from his office and the house where he grew up.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He punctuates his short-take answers with long silent stares, what some call &quot;Spike's game face.&quot; He seldom smiles, occasionally breaks into laughter at some private joke. More frequently, he interrupts the proceedings to consult with his crew and return phone calls from a stack of messages.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee attributes his strong self-image to his own family upbringing.  &quot;In the '30s and the '40s my grandmother was coloring birthday cards, Christmas cards, my mother's dolls with brown magic marker,&quot; he says. &quot;That's how our family was raised. It was a conscious effort on my grandmother's part who did not want her children and grandchildren growing up thinking black was ugly.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born Shelton Jackson Lee in Atlanta, March 20, 1957, the oldest of five children of William and Jacquelyn Lee, a jazz musician and a schoolteacher. The nickname Spike was his mother's doing, &quot;because she said I was a tough baby,&quot; says Lee. By all accounts, the tough baby grew into a shy child, &quot;an exceptionally quiet little boy who liked reading and sports,&quot; recalls his grandmother, Zimmie Shelton.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the family soon migrated to Chicago and then New York, because of those cities' burgeoning jazz scenes, Lee spent his summers in the South dividing his time between grandparents the Sheltons of Atlanta and the Lees of Montgomery Ala., where his grandfather, a disciple of Booker T. Washington, had founded the Snow Hill Institute, a private school modeled on the Tuskeegee Institute. In Brooklyn, Lee attended St. Ann's, a private school where his mother taught, and later the John Dewey High School.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Jacquelyn Lee largely supported the family for several years after Lee's father, something of a jazz purist, saw his career suffer when he refused to play electronic rather than acoustic instruments.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the reasons I became a filmmaker was because I was brought up in a very artistic household,&quot; says Lee, who has employed his father as a musician, his sisters Joie and Cinque as actors and his brother David as a photographer. (His brother Chris runs Lee's mail-order business.) &quot;My father was a great jazz musician and my mother taught art. Filmmaking can comprise a lot of those arts.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he enrolled at Atlanta's Morehouse College, the highly regarded black men's college where his father and grandfather had attended, Lee was considered a loner and a leader who took his cues from his close-knit family rather than his peers. He had only a handful of close friends, including Monty Ross who would later become his co-producer, and spent every weekend at the home of his grandmother.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was always very secretive and not particularly popular,&quot; recalls Zimmie Shelton. &quot;Spike was short, he didn't have a car and he ate every meal at my house. But he wanted to be a winner and he would work himself to a frazzle.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his sophomore year, two seminal events had occurred in Lee's life his mother, with whom he was very close, died of liver cancer, and he bought his first movie camera. Friends say Lee never mentioned his mother's death for months.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the camera, Lee's says &quot;I can't remember why I decided to buy that Super-8. My mother had taken me to lots of films when I was growing up, but it's not like a lot of filmmakers, you know, &quot;My parents took me to see Bambi when I was 4 years old and I wanted to be a filmmaker ever since.' It was more of an acquired taste for me.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Lee seems in it for the long haul, a single-minded entrepreneur who still rides the subway, still wears his low-rent wardrobe, but who pursues an ambitious vision financial<BR>&nbsp;<BR> ideological and artistic. He is currently renovating one of the three buildings he owns in Brooklyn to create his own screening, editing and recording facilities for his film and record divisions. He has a busy and lucrative side career, like many directors, shooting music videos for such artists as Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder and Prince.  And he continues to make commercials for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Levi-Straus and Diet Coke.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask his friends what drives the director, even those who have quarreled with him, they say his obsession with his career has less to do with money or fame although he enjoys both, than it has to do with a desire for respect.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee pauses in a moment of rare reflection at the end of a long afternoon and interview session. &quot;People are co-opted who want to be co-opted,&quot; he says. &quot;People who have power never give it up voluntarily. You never stop working toward that goal. Some say this country will never stop being racist, well that doesn't mean you throw up your hands. You acquire your own power, taking away other people's power over you. That's just taking back what should have been yours anyway.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was business as usual at last Friday night's Radisson Sundown 5K on the beach at Clearwater's Sand Key Park: Dror Vaknin of USF coasted to an easy win, tuning up for today's (Thursday) Peachtree Classic in Atlanta, and Heather Dawson of St. Petersburg won for the second time in the series by more than two minutes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawson's time was 18:35, good for eighth place in the field of 150; Vaknin cruised in at 16:16 on the all-sand surface in what he described as a &quot;tempo&quot; run.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the masters winner age 40 and over was unusual, however. Sixty-year-old Jack Gough of St. Petersburg, a national-class runner in his age division, was first in 19:30, 16th overall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gough, who clocked 17:06 for 5K eight years ago, finds himself in a Catch-22 situation.&nbsp;&quot;I'm just not into it like I once was,&quot; said Gough, who stands 6-1 and weighs between 160 and 165. &quot;If I work myself into top shape, I'm more motivated to compete. But when I train too much or too hard I come down with muscle injuries that hurt my motivation.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago Gough won national age group titles at 10 miles (59:30) at Raleigh, N.C., and at Naples over 8K (4.97 miles) in 29:18, beating his arch-rival, Jim Blount of Orlando. However, Blount beat him at the recent Bay-to-Bay race across First Avenue South in St. Petersburg.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gough claims the only reason he runs is to stay in shape: &quot;I used to play tennis, but then the courts got crowded. Then I took up golf and we had to ride instead of walk. So I took up bicycling until one day when I was going past Azelea Middle School and saw someone running, so I got off my bike and managed to run a lap.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there the Dayton, Ohio, native who didn't compete in high school or college started competing in local road races. At age 50, Gough clocked 34:58 for 10K and a year later at Gasparilla ran 15K in 53:46, both personal records. His marathon PR came at the British-American Marathon across the Gandy at age 52, a 2:49:35 effort.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gough averages seven miles a day, mostly in and around Veterans Memorial Park at Bay Pines. Late last year he was laid off as a mechanical design engineer by Honeywell in Clearwater. &quot;I have more time to train now,&quot; Gough said. &quot;I'd like to start doing double sessions, running twice a day.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine State Games: Frank Shorter, Olympic marathon gold medalist in 1972, will be in Tampa next Thursday, July 11, in connection with the Sunshine States Games at Bradenton, which begin on July 12. He will give a running clinic at the Quality Inn (210 E Fowler Ave.) at 7:30 p.m., which is open to the public. Shorter's marathon win at Munich, the first by an American in 64 years, was recently voted as the greatest moment in U.S. marathon history by more than 50 running journalists in the United States. Joan Benoit's win in the 1984 Olympic marathon was second in the balloting.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's quarterly rankings: 1.

The next race in the series at Sand Key Park is July 12 at 7 p.m. Sunset Beach Series No.  at Pass-a-Grille is scheduled for Friday night at 7 p.m. The distances are 3 and 6 miles. Register on-site. The Clearwater Jaycees summer series of 5Ks will be held on Wednesday nights from the Safety Harbor Spa at 7 p.m. on July 7, 17 and 24. The course is out-and-back along Bayshore Drive into Philippe Park. Call Dr.  Peter Carlson for further information, 442-7774. Chris Bloor of Seminole, fresh off a personal record 46:57 (5:02 pace) 15K at the Cascade Run-Off in Portland, Oregon, is moving to Toronto for the rest of the summer to train with Peter Maher. &quot;I'm going to give it two years,&quot; said Bloor, 28, referring to concentrating on his competitive running career. Maher, who trains winters in St.  Peterburg, will represent Canada in the marathon at next month's World Championships in Japan. Mary Matthews, 34, of Clearwater's Sunshine Running Team, ran Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minn., Saturday, in 3:43:10.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator 2: Judgment Day was back with a vengeance over the holiday weekend with a record-breaking box office take estimated at $ 52.8-million, industry sources said Sunday. The sequel to the hit 1984 science-fiction movie stood to break the five-day debut record set by Back to the Future Part II over the 1989 Thanksgiving holiday weekend with $ 43.016-million. In second place over the Wednesday-through-Sunday period was the comedy Naked Gun 2 The Smell of Fear ($ 12.5-million), followed by Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ($ 10.8-million), City Slickers ($ 8.5-million), Problem Child 2 and Rocketeer (both at $ 5.3-million). Terminator 2 is reportedly one of the costliest movies ever made. Production of the Carolco Pictures film was rumored to have reached $ 100-million. The costliest movies to date were Die Hard 2 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, each at $ 70-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Best foot forward<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has decided that Bo Jackson still knows All-Star baseball.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's prized Pinellas County football recruit was Greg Frey of Clearwater High. This year, the name Brian Magee is on everyone's lips and on everyone's list.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magee is appearing on all the preseason football recruiting lists.  Just like Frey, an offensive lineman who signed last year with Florida State, Largo High's Magee is being mentioned as one of the nation's top prospects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to scouting publications, like SuperPrep, Tom Lemming's Prep Football, and The Blue Chip Report, Magee is among the top 100 seniors in the nation. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound athlete is listed as a defensive back but can play other positions well a reason why the explosive Magee was the Times' Player of the Year in 1990.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magee is not alone in the spotlight. Countryside High defensive lineman Jeff Mitchell (6-4, 250) is on the SuperPrep list and, along with Magee, is named in Street &amp; Smith magazine as one of country's best seniors.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orlando-based Bill Buchalter's Scouting Report has Magee and Mitchell among the top 24 players in Florida. On the publication's expanded state list, Tarpon Springs' Kevin Reid is mentioned as one of the top 14 senior quarterbacks, teammate Israel Carr as one of the 13 best senior receivers, and East Lake's Scott Kadlub (6-1, 275) among the 17 best offensive linemen.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're counting, there are 18 days until high school practice begins, on Aug. 15. The county jamborees are Sept. 6. (Please see schedule in For the Record.) The season begins Sept. 13.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck, LaPorta join Spongers: Tarpon Springs High bolstered its coaching staff for this fall. Former Pinellas Park head football coach Bruce Buck has joined George Werner's staff as an assistant (he will be fine-tuning the talent of quarterback Reid), and Gibbs High head track and assistant football coach Tom LaPorta has transferred to Tarpon. He will lead the junior varsity football program and replace Gary Jones as the girls track coach. Jones replaces Jack Thompson, who resigned, as softball coach.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck coached Pinellas Park for nine years before resigning in 1990, taking a one-year leave of absence from teaching. &quot;I found out I really do want to teach and coach,&quot; Buck said recently. He will teach math at Tarpon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LaPorta's departure leaves another vacancy at Gibbs, which already is looking for a baseball coach. Of course, isn't everybody looking for a baseball coach, what with openings at Gibbs, Lakewood, Boca Ciega and Largo?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading way out of town: During the school year, their road trips might take them across town or into another county. But groups of baseball and basketball players are making big trips this summer to Australia, Ireland and Canada.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contingent from Upper Pinellas International Baseball left today for Australia the group's fourth trip since it was formed, in 1986. The previous ventures were to Japan, Germany and Canada.  Dunedin High coach Greg Nichols, who formed the UPIB, again is coaching the team. His squad consists of players from four high schools, including six incoming freshman.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have a good team, although we do have some young players,&quot; said Nichols, whose group will play in the Great Barrier Reef Tournament Aug. 2-4 in Cairns, then play exhibitions in Brisbane and Sydney before heading home Aug. 12.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several basketball teams are heading to Ireland to play in the Emerald Cup, in Limerick Aug. 4-11. Two of the girls teams (18-and-under and 16-and-under) are being coached by former Clearwater High coach Mike Kessenger and Countryside High coach John Napoli. The teams consist of players from Clearwater, Countryside and East Lake. Two Tampa teams also include Pinellas players.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another girls basketball team, coached by Clearwater Central Catholic coach Dean Soles, is heading to Canada. Soles, who brought a team to the U.S.S.R. and Finland last year, is coaching a group consisting mainly of CCC players. The squad will play games in the U.S. along the way.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For team rosters, please see For The Record.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't touch him: A recent Sports Illustrated story featured prestigious summer camps for high school basketball players $ including the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basketball camp (about 120 participants), conducted earlier this month in Indianapolis. Throngs of college coaches crowd such exclusive camps, keeping informal contact with prospects.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coaches need not bother with Dixie Hollins' Dametri Hill, the only Pinellas County player at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp. Hill, 6-7, 260 pounds, and the leading scorer in Pinellas (25.9-point average) last season, made an oral commitment to the University of Florida in April.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill is playing this week in the AAU Junior Olympics in Tallahassee, with several other area players, under the direction of Pinellas Park High coach Pat Healy.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget cuts: Pinellas County sports schedules will be shortened this year (except for varsity football) in an effort to save money.  Pinellas is not alone. Hillsborough County is proposing cuts to save about $ 150,000. Among the proposals: cutting one game from every schedule except in varsity football, eliminating spring football jamborees, canceling junior high championships, and cutting travel money.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These are hard times for everybody,&quot; Valrico Bloomingdale football coach Bobby Bennett said. &quot;Eliminating the spring jamboree is better than eliminating spring football.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the country: Football coach Jan R. Smith, who won three Utah state championships despite having multiple sclerosis, died this month from complications of the disease. He was 41. The former Brigham Young University back led Morgan High to titles in 1977, 1979 and 1983. Smith, who last coached in 1987, roamed the sidelines in a golf cart, his voice softened to a whisper.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a hot prospect signs with a university and shows up at campus doesn't mean he will play. University of Texas redshirt quarterback Steve Clements, Texas' all-time leading high school passer, plans to transfer from Texas to Brigham Young because he is listed third on the Longhorns' depth chart.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother called him &quot;a party-party, fun-type kid,&quot; but Chad Hughes, an Arizona state wrestling champion from Scottsdale, overdid matters Memorial Day weekend. To celebrate his upcoming graduation, Hughes, 18, was drinking and performing back flips among a crowd of 400 in a Mexican bar. On one flip attempt, he landed on his head, severed his spinal cord, and cracked his skull.  He died 90 minutes later, of a heart attack.<BR> Information from correspondent Jim Tomlin and the Associated Press was used in this column.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: How come baseball coaches wear baseball caps but football coaches don't wear football helmets?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: Because football helmets are equipment, good only for playing football, while baseball caps are clothing, and can be worn virtually anywhere by anybody.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment/clothing distinction is more fluid than you might think.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, D'Artagnan's sword was equipment, but what about the swords that are part of the dress uniforms of men whether Knights of Columbus or Army officers who never use them and may not even know how?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These non-fencers' swords are elements of costume, just like their epaulettes and brass buttons.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 10 years ago, hiking boots were equipment; now most of them are clothes. One result: Hiking boot sales have tripled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago I tried on a five-pound pair of serious-equipment-type hiking boots, the kind designed for people who feel obliged to climb tall mountains just because they're there.  They felt like a couple of concrete blocks strapped to my feet and not for nothing. You need that rigidity, the salesman explained, if you want to put on some crampons and walk straight up an iced-over waterfall or traverse a glacier.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, most people who want to get out into the outdoors and have fun have something less ambitious in mind, like a three- or four-mile hike with the family. Or just something different, like trail-running or a hell-for-leather ride on a mountain bike.  Something you could almost do in sneakers, except that this is a culture that's managed to convince 12-year-olds that they need $ 100 basketball shoes to ride the school bus, so nobody has to tell these hikers and bikers and trail-runners that they need special shoes, shoes that at least look like equipment.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't need the full steel shanks and stiff leather of waterfall-walkers, and they won't put up with the weight, or put in the month or two it takes to break a pair in.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they don't have to. Lightweight, instantly comfortable hiking boots were first introduced 10 years ago; Hi-Tec's Sierra Lite and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lava Dome were two of the first. &quot;We basically made our running shoes more rugged,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Craig Duerr says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's still some arguing about whether the lightweights were designed to meet the needs of casual hikers or just to create a new market niche athletic shoe companies could fill.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever, lightweight hikers were a big success. Art Kenyon of Vasque, an old-line hiking boot manufacturer, estimates that today, the lightweights account for 60 percent to 65 percent of the market.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey by the National Sporting Goods Association, sales of hiking boots nearly tripled over the past five years though hiking increased by only 30 percent. What this must mean is that lots of the people who buy hiking boots aren't hiking in them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSGA's Tom Doyle says that &quot;about 60 percent of athletic shoes are never used for their intended purpose.&quot; But when most hiking boots weighed five pounds and took weeks to break in, hardly anybody bought them to mow the lawn in. (Though, in the late 1960s, people who had bought them for mountaineering sometimes wore them to English class as a badge of outdoorsy cool.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightweights, Kenyon says, are more &quot;multi-use&quot; n other words, they're clothes, not equipment. He says people wear them &quot;to watch the kids play football, mow the grass, clean out the garage,&quot; and landscapers wear them as work boots because they're &quot;not too dorky&quot; to wear after work.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lightweight hikers are mutating again to produce a new shoe category designed for what the manufacturers call &quot;outdoor cross-training.&quot; Outdoor cross-trainers, clearly inspired by the success of the geographically non-specific cross-trainers that hit the market a couple of years ago, are designed for trail running,&nbsp; mountain biking and hiking.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might not think those three activities would attract enough people to sustain a whole shoe category, and you'd probably be right. But Dave Getchell, Backpacker magazine's equipment editor, points out that though only a limited number of people actually hike, run trails and ride mountain bikes, lots more like the idea and may want &quot;to identify with these nice green activities&quot; by wearing the shoes, &quot;just the way people who live in the suburbs drive Jeep Cherokees and kids who don't play basketball wear Air Jordans.&quot;<BR> - Patricia McLaughlin has written for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Washington Post and Rolling Stone magazine.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the tennis world, Nick Bollettieri has always been the red Corvette gleaming among a fleet of beige Ford Escorts. The hustler with the big dreams. The man in the Hollywood sunglasses. How he didn't end up a cigar-chomping owner of the Yankees or a string of Atlantic City casinos is a mystery.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, like an uninvited guest, he scraped out a place for himself in the polite sport of tennis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri, 60, has coached such top pros as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Jim Courier, Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krickstein. He also operates a 54-court tennis factory in Bradenton to nurture young players. They pour in from around the world to steep in an atmosphere of discipline and motivation. To be in the nearness of Nick.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, as Agassi's star ascended, Bollettieri (pronounced Bo-luh-TER-i) has crossed over from coach to tennis personality.  He is negotiating with K mart and Wal-Mart to sell his $ 13.95 instructional tennis videos. He recently had his teeth bleached to a glaring shade of white. Gone is the gold jewelry that used to adorn his golden brown chest.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, honor and respect were bestowed on Bollettieri. The United States Professional Tennis Association named him the teaching pro of the year.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bollettieri began giving tennis lessons in the late 1950s on public courts in North Miami Beach, he charged $ 1.50 a half-hour. Today, what little private teaching he accepts costs between $ 1,000 and $ 1,500 for a two-hour consultation.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bollettieri is known as much for self-promotion as he is for coaching skills. He is the Don King of tennis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nick is always good for a quote,&quot; says NBC tennis analyst Bud Collins. &quot;He's always visible in the stands. And Nick always takes his shirt off so he can keep that bronze going.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this sweltering morning in early September, the Grand Master Flash is wearing pink nylon shorts, making phone calls in his small office at the tennis academy. An assistant pops through the door and reminds him he needs to make an appearance on court. It is the last day of tennis camp for a group of foreign students who have paid thousands of dollars to study at Bollettieri's.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The kids from Africa, where the hell they from?&quot; Bollettieri asks, a blue Adidas tank top covers his George Hamilton tan.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Arabia,&quot; reminds an assistant, as Bollettieri rustles through a stack of correspondance. He has spent most of the summer touring with Agassi in Europe, then on to the U.S. Open in New York in late August, where Agassi got bumped off in the first round. Two full briefcases await him this morning. His beagle-brown eyes are bloodshot from working long hours. He requires only about four hours of sleep. At 6 a.m., his personal fitness trainer shows up. From there, he is up and running, no coffee needed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Put a P.S. on the one to Jaegg, the president of Adidas,&quot; Bollettieri calls out to his assistant, Cheryl. (He talks in a loud, slightly hoarse voice.) From his black European purse he removes a pink comb and sweeps it through his hair. &quot;Looking forward to the expo in January and spending time with you.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bollettieri recently switched his allegiance to Adidas. That's all he wears. That's all the pro shop at the academy sells. He recently has come out with his own line of apparel, which Adidas manufactures and embroiders with the Bollettieri logo.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A player named Marco calls on line one. Marco wants to study under Bollettieri and live at the academy. Bollettieri thinks he can come up with $ 20,000 so Marco can start touring, plus rackets and clothing. &quot;I've talked to IMG,&quot; says Bollettieri, referring to the powerful sports management firm. &quot;There's some interest. If I push it, they'll have a lot of interest. We've got a place for you to stay. You gotta get out there where you're knockin' heads, not that college-y stuff.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> It's nearly 11:30, and an assistant reminds Bollettieri about the kids from Saudi Arabia. He grabs his orange Donnay Pro One racket, slips on a shirt and heads for the door. He calls for an assistant to walk with him out to the courts. Bollettieri wants to hear what he found out about prices on speed boats.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the courts, a young man pops out of the Nautilus room. &quot;Hey, Nick,&quot; he shouts, standing in the sun and flexing his arm muscles like Popeye.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get inside, you wimp,&quot; Bollettieri yells, playfully. He is a fitness freak. If there's a lull in a conference, he'll take two chairs in his office and form a makeshift exercise machine to work on his abdominals.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes big, aggressive steps for a man his size. (His glossy brochure for the tennis academy generously describes his height at 5 feet 10.) Once on the tennis court, Bollettieri charges over to a grocery cart full of yellow Penn balls. An assistant hands him three as he stands by the net and addresses the group of boys from Saudi.  &quot;You kids speak English?&quot; he asks.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding balls across the net, Bollettieri doesn't even have to dip into the ball cart; perfect sets of three are handed to him by an assistant, a former Davis Cup player from Colombia. After 15 minutes of instruction, Bollettieri tells the boys to gather 'round.  Time for the goodbye speech.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where you guys from?&quot; he asks, and one of them says Saudi Arabia. He throws out his chin and nods his head. &quot;Hot there, cold, what?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1940s, the pristine grass courts of the U.S. Open at Forest Hills were just a subway ride away from Bollettieri's blue-collar neighborhood outside of the Bronx in New York. But tennis was for rich kids and sissies. Little Nick, he shot marbles on the street corner and tried to steer clear of his grandmother, Vera, who'd &quot;take a rolling pin and whack you in the ass&quot; if you stepped out of line.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father was a pharmacist, his mother a housewife. He grew up in a big Italian family, with lots of aunts and uncles. His grandfather used to make red wine in the cellar.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-50s, after serving with the 187th Airborne in the Korean War, Bollettieri enrolled in Spring Field College in Alabama to study philosophy. He began playing tennis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, he entered the University of Miami School of Law. For extra money, he taught tennis lessons at the Victory Park public courts in North Miami Beach. After morning classes, he'd drive his rattle-trap Plymouth to the park, where the asphalt courts were bumpy and the nets were made of iron mesh.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri charged $ 1.50 for a half-hour lesson. One of his first students was 5-year-old Brian Gottfried, who later would win doubles titles at the French Open and Wimbledon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri quit law school after a year. He taught tennis full-time.  &quot;We didn't have much,&quot; he remembers. &quot;Back then, sneakers were $ 2.35 and Jack Kramer rackets were $ 6.35.&quot; In the summer heat, he'd put up an umbrella near the Pepsi machine. That was his country club.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's reputation as an instructor grew. The Rockefeller family hired him to be the coach of a resort they owned in Puerto Rico. In 1977, he became the head pro at the Colony Beach and Tennis Resort on Longboat Key. He had the idea to invite promising junior players from around the country to train at his tennis camp on a year-round basis. Sort of like a boot camp for tennis players.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students would attend academic classes at a private school in the morning and begin their workouts by early afternoons. Some students lived in a nearby motor lodge and others slept at Bollettieri's house. One of the teaching pros doubled as a chef.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the junior stand-outs who enrolled in the intensive program were Jimmy Arias, Kathy Horvath and Carling Bassett. By 1980, Bollettieri's program had outgrown the Colony.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had built to his specifications his 22-acre facility in Bradenton.  Today, it is a sprawling sports empire with 170 employees. During the school year, 150 students live in condominiums on the grounds.  Tuition is $ 2,600 a month, which includes private school.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri known more for his motivational skills than his coaching techniques is still hoping for a true champion, one who rises to the top and stays there. Even Agassi, his brightest star, has yet to win a Grand Slam title.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, few coaches have had as many successful players as Bollettieri. One year, 32 of his students were in the draw at Wimbledon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, he sponsors a few juniors who show promise. They live and learn at the academy at no charge. In 1982, 14-year-old Ricky Brown was invited from Tennessee to study under Bollettieri. He eventually reached No. 170 in the world. Brown, who is now the tennis director at the River Crossing Country Club in New Port Richey, says his parents never could have afforded sending him to Bollettieri's academy. He lived there for almost three years.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He hand-picked the best juniors and gave them free rides,&quot; says Brown. &quot;That brought in other kids by the truckload.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's tennis academy is like a microwave it cooks at a higher intensity then most conventional tennis schools. Players are zapped into professionals almost overnight.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri says he has mellowed in recent years. He says he wants kids to have fun. &quot;We're reinforcing a self-image and a self-concept,&quot; he says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the idea is still to produce champions.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is not something that's taken lightly,&quot; says Greg Hill of North Carolina, whose son, 13-year-old Greg Jr., is one of Bollettieri's most promising students. &quot;We have a specific plan we'll be following for the next few years.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 15-year-old girl from Yugoslavia, a superb athlete, didn't begin playing tennis until age 13 ancient, compared with most other young players today, who begin swinging a racket the minute they are hatched. She now trains full-time at Bollettieri's. A tennis player is being built, literally, from the ground up. Her father stands quietly by the court as she drills and plays matches all day, handing her a jug of water when she takes a break at the net. It won't be long before she's ready for the pro tour.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri has an uncanny ability to spot talent. But he is also quick to see the danger signs of overly zealous parents who think they'd make great coaches.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I do a deal with the little girl,&quot; he says, recalling a particular promising junior he helped. &quot;It's so good it's scary. It's four years before the girl turns pro. I told her father, &quot;If I see her hit any balls after she leaves here, you've got her. You're getting my time. We'll give her clothes, rackets, everything.' &quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri shakes his head, thinking of all the parents who've loused up his plans. &quot;When you're waiting five years for a return . .  .&quot; his voice trails off.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's very simple,&quot; he says. &quot;I decided this year, if you don't like it&nbsp; my way, take the highway.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is wheeled in on a silver cart turkey or ham sandwiches, tuna with lemon and olive oil, no mayonnaise, and fresh fruit. Rita, the chef at the academy, fixes Bollettieri's plate. The other five or six employees who are asked to dine with Bollettieri serve themselves. The sound of the Pete Sampras-Jim Courier match (which Courier would win) in the quarter finals of the U.S. Open drifts in from the TV set in the next room.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sampras beat the crap out of Courier in the first set,&quot; someone reports.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri used to coach Courier, who grew up in Dade City but spent many of his teen-age years at Bollettieri's academy. Last April, around the time Monica Seles decided to defect from Bollettieri, Courier went his own way, too.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bollettieri hears how his former student is faring in the match against Sampras, he says nothing. He pours himself some tea.  He won't describe his bitterness over Seles, either. Never has. &quot;I took the right road by not saying anything,&quot; he says.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops gathered around the lunch table quiz him about the U.S. Open. Like a hero who has just returned from the front lines, he shares his stories.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was on the phone with Andre for a long time last night,&quot; Bollettieri says, when the questions finally stop. &quot;And I said, &quot;You can't change what you are for the public. When you change, it's gonna affect you.' &quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Agassi, 1991 has been a bust so far in the tennis department.  His shaggy mug is everywhere in hip </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads, on MTV, in Rolling Stone but he's had problems with his game. Maybe too much fame too soon.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri says he's received no financial compensation for his years of coaching Agassi or any other of his proteges. &quot;I've never taken a penny,&quot; he says. &quot;And these kids are making millions and millions.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agassi gave Bollettieri a $ 60,000 Corvette ZR-1 for Christmas two years ago.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's annual salary as president of his tennis academy, not including endorsements and incentives? Six figures, he says, &quot;way up in six figures.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes his cars. He's lent his name to Mitsubishi Motors, so he owns several, including a ZR1 Twin Turbo. In addition to his three-acre residence on Longboat Key, where he lives with his fifth wife, Kellie, and their two young daughters, he's renovating a condominium closer to the academy. The condo has no garage.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The only thing that kills me is seeing my sports car out in that hot sun,&quot; he says, wistfully.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is cleared away. Bollettieri removes a pack of Stim-u-dents from his black purse and goes to work on his choppers. He peers through the screen door. The sun beats down and beckons all sadists outside. By 1:30 p.m., he's due on court for more instruction.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri loves body surfing and snow skiing, but he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. He has to ask one of his assistants. He also can't remember the last film he saw.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like the movies, man,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know the names of them, but I like them.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he is out the door, four steps ahead of anyone who dares to follow, carrying his orange racket like a bayonet.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what it's like to be No. 1 in the world?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri is addressing the group of kids in his special program. It is their second week at the academy. They are sitting down for his talk, scattered across the green clay court near the back fence.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Other coaches,&quot; he says, &quot;none of them are my enemies because they're all No. 2.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives a whirlwind speech on the competitive spirit necessary for becoming a champion. His teaching pros, young men in Oakley sunglasses and Umbro nylon shorts and gold hoop earrings, stand by quietly with their brightly colored Donnay rackets. It's no surprise that the flashy Agassi sprang from this atmosphere of Day-Glo tennis mobsters.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the brief talk is over, brutality begins drills. Every conceivable variation on every shot is practiced, at a breathless pace. As his instructors feed balls and work on specific shots, Bollettieri walks from court to court like an inspector general. He has eyes in the back of his head. He'll have his back turned to a group of kids drilling cross-court backhands and he'll suddenly whip around to face them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what I get a little concerned over,&quot; he says, pushing his assistant out of the way so he can feed balls to the player, &quot;is you come off that forehand too slowly. Ya hug.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 10 balls, the player, a blond boy with a spiked haircut, corrects his stroke. &quot;Bee-UTY-full,&quot; shouts Bollettieri, as if cajoling a prizefighter. &quot;Beautiful, baby.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gimme some stick on that forehand,&quot; he encourages an Asian girl. &quot;You roll with it, dear. Lift it.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look at him,&quot; he yells at another player. &quot;He looks like a garbage collector.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtside telephone rings. Bollettieri takes the call. It's Aaron Krickstein's trainer. Bollettieri barks some advice over the phone until something catches his eye on the court. The blood vessels on his forehead start to pulse. He has witnessed a lazy retreat for a lob.  He abruptly cups the mouthpiece.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GET THAT BALL,&quot; he shouts, the stretched telephone cord holding him back like a leash. &quot;I'M NOT YOUR VALET. C'MON,&nbsp; JUICE IT, BABY, JUICE IT.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly, he goes back to his call. &quot;Where were we?&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY HILARY DE VRIES<BR>Special to The Globe and Mail<BR>  New York<BR> IT is the voice that is surprising - soft, slurry, a half-asleep whisper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Black people kissing on screen? I never saw that growing up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says this staring out of the editing booth, watching a print of his<BR>new film, Jungle Fever, run over and over, the images of a black man and a<BR>white woman reflected in his glasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uh-uh,&quot; he says with almost purposed distraction, an imperceptible<BR>turn of his head. &quot;I'm attentive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a performance - a mastery of the deadpan, as he has put it - as<BR>integral to the Spike Lee persona as the wire-rims, baseball cap and<BR>sneakers. Behind the glasses, his eyes are enormous, impassive. His body,<BR>a spindly afterthought ending in the soft padding of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nikes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intermingling of the races? That's always going to be a part of my<BR>work,&quot; he says, staring at the screen. &quot;That has happened since the slaves<BR>were brought here - stolen from Africa - when massa started sneaking in<BR>the slave quarters at night. That's the dynamics of colour and race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee silently watches a few more frames. Suddenly he throws his head<BR>back and laughs, a short, raucous burst. &quot;There's one thing that black men<BR>have that really threatens white males.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask anyone who knows him and you will hear that Spike Lee is a<BR>troublemaker. Serious. His films - She's Gotta Have It (1986), School Daze<BR>(1988), Do The Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990) and now, Jungle<BR>Fever - have been sharp, repeated blows to the Hollywood axiom that black<BR>doesn't sell in white America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every one of Lee's films - black American cultural themes married to a<BR>cinematic style drawn from Martin Scorsese, Japan's Akira Kurasowa and the<BR>French new wave of filmmakers - has made money. And each has generated<BR>equal currency in the media, which address them as missives from the front<BR>lines of cultural politics. When Do The Right Thing - a filmic examination<BR>of racism in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood that seemed to<BR>advocate violence as a means of social reform - opened two summers ago,<BR>critics and civic leaders predicted, wrongly, that it would spark riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee is the most influential black American director working in<BR>Hollywood today, one who is making his movies, albeit low-budget by most<BR>studio standards, on his terms. His films have expanded the boundaries of<BR>U.S. popular culture, altered Hollywood's perception of cross-over<BR>audiences, and opened the door for a new generation of black male<BR>directors - the Hudlin Brothers, Robert Townsend, Keenan Ivory Wynans,<BR>Bill Duke among them - who are redefining the roles that blacks play on<BR>screen and within the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee suggests that &quot;it's a combination of everything - part talent, part<BR>luck, part timing. I'm not the first talented black filmmaker to appear on<BR>the face of the earth. If I had come along 20 years ago, the conditions<BR>weren't conducive to this kind of success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, nearly 20 feature films will have been made and released by<BR>black Americans - more than in the entire decade before. At 34 and with<BR>five films to his credit, Lee has become something of the group's eminence<BR>grise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dozens of black Americans have directed films before,&quot; says Roger<BR>Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times. &quot;But the subtext of those<BR>movies was always how blacks related to whites. Spike broke through that.<BR>He defines blacks in relation to other blacks. That is brand new.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's Gotta Have It, Lee's first feature film, shot for $175,000 in<BR>16mm, explored sexuality from the unusual perspective of a liberated black<BR>woman. The film won the Prix de la Jeunesse award at the Cannes Film<BR>Festival and went on to gross $8-million. School Daze probed such issues<BR>as the clash between light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks. Do The Right<BR>Thing exhumed racial bigotry and class hatred among New York's under-<BR>class. Mo' Better Blues chronicled the lives of middle-class black jazz<BR>musicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Jungle Fever, featuring Wesley Snipes, Anthony Quinn and Annabelle<BR>Sciorra, explores interracial relationships. While some critics speculated<BR>that the film, which is dedicated to a black youth murdered by whites two<BR>years ago, might prove as controversial as Do The Right Thing, the<BR>decidedly mixed reviews of Jungle Fever did not bear that out. Meanwhile,<BR>Lee is already in pre-production on his most ambitious film to date - the<BR>coveted Malcolm X project with a budget that may reach $30-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are suggestions, however, that Lee's standing within the film<BR>industry and the black community is due less to his talents than to his<BR>entrepreneurial instincts and political sensibilities, which are<BR>emblematic, more than those of any other black director, of the country's<BR>resurging interest in racial issues. Lee's cultural politics, evident in<BR>his films and frequent public statements, reflected much of the public<BR>outrage voiced after the racially motivated killing in New York's<BR>Bensonhurst neighbourhood, and an earlier one in Howard Beach, as well as<BR>the recent beating by Los Angeles police of a black motorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee has positioned his career at that crossroads of art and publicity<BR>and his off-screen activities have earned him almost as much note as his<BR>films. He has publicly attacked Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and<BR>Quincy Jones as sell-out cross-over artists. He has criticized several<BR>Hollywood directors, including Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood, for<BR>making films about black Americans. He called Edward Koch, then mayor of<BR>New York, a &quot;racist&quot; and said he hoped Do The Right Thing would defeat his<BR>bid for re-election. When the film lost at Cannes in 1989, he accused the<BR>festival jury of racism. When Jungle Fever lost this year, he said: &quot;We<BR>got screwed again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee makes commercials for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the sportswear manufacturer that has<BR>been accused of exploiting inner-city black children - the high cost of<BR>its products, critics say, encourages crime or violence to acquire them.<BR>He was embroiled in a public feud with B'nai Brith's Anti-Defamation<BR>League, which objected to the treatment of Jews in his films. And he<BR>openly campaigned for the Malcolm X film by insisting that only a black<BR>director was competent to do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director has buttressed his pronouncements with growing financial<BR>clout. He is the only black American filmmaker to mass market himself the<BR>way that Eddie Murphy, Prince and Michael Jackson have. In addition to his<BR>film company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Lee owns Spike's Joint, a<BR>lucrative retail and mail-order business, and earlier this year, he<BR>started his own record label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't own stuff, you have no power,&quot; Lee says. &quot;For me, that's<BR>the whole issue. When black people start thinking more like entrepreneurs<BR>instead of just consumers, instead of 'Please Mr. White Man, can you do so<BR>and so for me,' we will call the shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every critic or studio head who hails Lee as a genuine pioneer,<BR>there are those, even in the black critical community, who insist that he<BR>is neither a talented filmmaker nor a serious social critic, that the<BR>racial and economic situations of his films are exploitative -<BR>particularly of black women - and the films' political positions are<BR>undercut by a fatal, commercial-driven, ambiguity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews with dozens of colleagues, employees and friends reveal a<BR>man whose entrepreneurial success has not trickled down. While Lee is<BR>considered something of a cultural separatist (he employs mostly blacks on<BR>his crews and in his business ventures, with the notable exception of his<BR>lawyer, Arthur Klein), they suggest that after six years in the business<BR>he has become arrogant, self-interested, a multimillionaire who underpays<BR>artists and employees. For all his public support of a new black economic<BR>solidarity, the director has simply co-opted traditional studio-boss<BR>attitudes - a vision extending only to his own pocketbook. The most<BR>powerful black in Hollywood may be the most resented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spike's single-mindedness is his best and his worst quality,&quot; says<BR>Nelson George, a screenwriter, music critic, columnist for the Village<BR>Voice, and one of Lee's original backers. &quot;He tunnel-visions people out<BR>when he doesn't need them and he has not been as visionary as he could be<BR>in helping other people's careers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spike is out for Spike,&quot; says one actor, who requested anonymity. &quot;He<BR>talks about black people staying together but he puts people down in the<BR>press and it's a documented fact that he doesn't pay people well. But<BR>because he's Spike Lee nobody wants to say anything and you'd be a fool<BR>not to work with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, who still lives and works in the same Brooklyn neighborhood where<BR>he was raised, is unfazed by the criticism. &quot;I have no conflicts at all,<BR>about my success,&quot; he says. &quot;None.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black people should be the recipients of the money that is being<BR>generated by black culture. In the past we were getting flim-flammed,<BR>bamboozled. Having talent is not enough. You have to have some business<BR>know-how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee says the idea for Jungle Fever came to him two years ago during the<BR>shooting of Mo' Better Blues, when Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old black<BR>youth from Brooklyn, was beaten to death by white youths who mistakenly<BR>thought he was visiting a girlfriend in the Italian community of<BR>Bensonhurst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a key scene in Jungle Fever between the protagonists - Flipper<BR>Purify, a married black architect from Harlem (played by Snipes) and Angie<BR>Tucci, his Italian American secretary and lover from Bensonhurst (played<BR>by Sciorra). Their brief but tension-fraught relationship is ending<BR>because of economic and cultural differences between them and their<BR>respective families and because of the issue of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What about kids?&quot; says Angie. &quot;You and me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. No. No babies. No mixed-race babies,&quot; says Purify, shaking his<BR>head. &quot;Mixed-race babies come out nothing but a bunch of mixed nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That scene, which ends with Angie accusing Purify of exhibiting the<BR>same kind of racism espoused by their parents, encapsulates one of the<BR>film's major themes - that even in a post-civil-rights era economic and<BR>educational advances cannot erase centuries of cultural differences and<BR>racial injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can see it now,&quot; says Lee with a small laugh. &quot;Spike Lee says 'No!<BR>to inter-racial relationships.' But this film is about boundaries - real<BR>and self-imposed boundaries - and what happens when you cross them. A lot<BR>of these relationships aren't based on love, but on sexual myths - that<BR>the white woman is the epitome of beauty and that black males are sexual<BR>supermen. One of the things we tried to raise in the film is whether<BR>someone is necessarily a racist if they are opposed to interracial<BR>marriages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, who intends the film to raise questions about community and<BR>cultural identity, is himself adamantly opposed to interracial<BR>relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not attracted to white women on that level. But I understand there<BR>are black men who are.&quot; Indeed, his father Bill married a white woman,<BR>Susan Kaplan Lee, after the death of Jacquelyn Lee, his first wife and<BR>Lee's mother. Friends say the remarriage remains a painful subject for the<BR>director today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     (Lee is coyly cryptic about his personal life, insisting he is &quot;married  to cinema.&quot; His long-time relationship with Cheryl Burr, a dancer he met  while studying at New York University and to whom he gave a small part in  She's Gotta Have It, ended a couple of years ago. More recently, Lee has  been linked with model Veronica Webb, who has a small part in Jungle  Fever.)     One of Jungle Fever's most powerful scenes features a frank discussion  among several black women who are &quot;looking for a strong black man to  date.&quot; Although Lee had scripted the scene, after two days of rehearsals  most of the actresses were ad-libbing. Says Lee, &quot;The actresses are  espousing their own views - 'Who am I going to marry? There are not enough  black men out there.' That's the reality that black women are facing -  that they don't have a great choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an issue about which the director has strong personal feelings.<BR>&quot;Racism has taught black people to hate themselves. And if you hate<BR>yourself, then why would you want somebody - one who has made you hate<BR>yourself - as your mate? Black people have been pounded by the media with<BR>the image of white women as the epitome of beauty. That has an effect on<BR>your subconscious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oldest son of a jazz musician and a school teacher, Lee attributes<BR>his awareness of the issue to his own upbringing. He was the third<BR>generation of his family to attend Morehouse College, the prestigious all-<BR>black men's college in Atlanta, where he was born in 1957, and spent most<BR>of his summers visiting his grandparents in that city. &quot;In the thirties<BR>and the forties my grandmother was colouring birthday cards, Christmas<BR>cards, my mother's dolls with brown magic marker,&quot; he says. &quot;That's how<BR>our family was raised. It was a conscious effort on my grandmother's part<BR>who did not want her children and grandchildren growing up thinking black<BR>was ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spike comes from a really strong family base,&quot; says one of Lee's<BR>closest friends, jazz trumpeter Bradford Marsalis. &quot;He never hung out with<BR>the crowd. He had his sights set on bigger things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if I can say there is black esthetic in filmmaking yet,&quot;<BR>Lee says. &quot;It has to be developed over time and we're still in our<BR>infancy. There is definitely a black esthetic in music, art and dance. . .<BR>. For me black (culture) is a lot more interesting. A lot of white culture<BR>is dying out. I know (whites) think that (too) because they try and steal<BR>everything they can and make money off it and then have audacity to call<BR>it their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are co-opted who want to be co-opted. People who have power<BR>never give it up voluntarily. You never stop working towards that goal.<BR>Some say this country will never stop being racist; well, that doesn't<BR>mean you throw up your hands. You acquire your own power, taking away<BR>other people's power over you. That's just taking back what should have<BR>been yours anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY HARVEY ENCHIN<BR>The Globe and Mail<BR> IN 200 stores across Canada, the Bata Shoe Organization is putting the<BR>boot to high prices and banal marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But its $1-million media blitz is more than a manipulative ploy; it is<BR>the first outward sign of - with apologies to Mao Tsetung - a cultural<BR>revolution sweeping through one of Canada's blandest companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The employees believe there's a revolution going on in Bata and that<BR>they're part of it,&quot; asserts Martin O'Neill, president of Bata's Canadian<BR>unit. &quot;It's starting to manifest itself in the way we perform. We're being<BR>more successful and they're having more fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, ruled paternalistically for 53 years by Thomas J. Bata,<BR>had earned a worldwide reputation as a staid supplier of low-priced<BR>footwear. But by the time Mr. Bata turned the helm over to his son, Thomas<BR>G. Bata, in 1985, it seemed out of step with market trends and global<BR>competition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bata, for example, missed the boat on running shoes, turning up its<BR>nose when given the opportunity to finance the start up of Reebok<BR>International Ltd., today a world leader in athletic footwear. Although<BR>Bata now has high hopes, its own brand of Power athletic shoes has miles<BR>to go before it catches up to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nike</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc., Adidas AG or Reebok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when it comes to the art of advertising, Bata has lagged its rivals<BR>by light years. The last time Bata swept customers off their feet with<BR>marketing finesse was in 1922 when it pioneered the 50-per-cent-off sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the recent campaign, created by the Canadian arm of D'Arcy Masius<BR>Benton &amp; Bowles Inc., a New York agency, Bata had relied more on in-store<BR>promotions preaching quality and good value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new multimedia blitz is a reflection of the emerging corporate<BR>culture radically transforming tradition-bound Bata. In an extensive<BR>television, radio and newspaper campaign, combined with point-of-sale<BR>promotion and home-delivered flyers, the company declares itself the<BR>revolutionary republic of Bata and proclaims its independence from<BR>Canada's high prices. It takes dead aim at cross-border shopping with the<BR>claim that Bata's prices are the same as or lower than those of its<BR>competitors in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what they're doing is great,&quot; said Michael Budman, co-founder<BR>of Roots Canada Ltd., noting that his stores had a cross-border promotion<BR>in May offering a 30-cent premium on the Canadian dollar. &quot;It took us six<BR>weeks to realize the devastating affect of the GST on the Canadian<BR>consumer. Then we took an aggressive stand on our pricing, giving the<BR>customer every reason to stay in Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elder Bata, a long-time anti-Communist, might be shocked by his<BR>company's guise as a revolutionary republic, complete with national<BR>anthem, passports and banners in rebellious black and red. Yet since his<BR>own father applied Henry Ford's mass production methods to the footwear<BR>industry, turning his hometown of Zlin into the Detroit of Czechoslovakia,<BR>the 97-year-old company has been somewhat of an empire unto itself. In<BR>some parts of the world, bata is the word for shoe and Mr. Bata and his<BR>wife, Sonja, are treated as heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 76, Mr. Bata has pretty well completed the succession of his throne<BR>to his son. In his autobiography, he expresses satisfaction that no senior<BR>executives resigned in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in fact, new management blood is the main ingredient in Bata's<BR>rejuvenation. The average age of the executive team has dropped to 43 from<BR>nearly 55 in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he joined Bata only three months ago as a key member of that<BR>team, Martin O'Neill, a lanky 40-year-old native of Northern Ireland, is<BR>leading the charge for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really is beginning with Martin,&quot; said personnel manager Paul<BR>Giroudy. &quot;He is bringing to Bata a new corporate culture. And in this<BR>culture people are learning to put an ear to the ground and listen to what<BR>is happening out in the marketplace and then to respond to what the market<BR>is telling us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cultural revolution is happening in-house and it's happening with<BR>Martin coming on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A devotee of Japanese manufacturing techniques, new age management<BR>methods and the hard sell, Mr. O'Neill, an economics graduate from London<BR>University, melds marketing and motivation in his remedies to revitalize<BR>ailing companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've rewritten the mission statement for the Canadian company,&quot; he<BR>said in an interview. &quot;We will be No. 1 in the marketplace. We will be<BR>faster than the competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Neill is responsible for 800 stores in North America and 100 in<BR>Britain as well as four factories in Mexico and one each in Canada, the<BR>United States and Britain. His retail and manufacturing operations employ<BR>5,000 people, a fraction of Bata's total work force of 70,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're relatively insignificant in the First World compared with the<BR>Third World,&quot; he explained, noting Bata's overwhelming presence in Asia<BR>and Africa. &quot;I've sat in meetings making major investment decisions for<BR>countries where the economics looked good so I was very positive. But<BR>afterwards I had to ask someone where the country was even though<BR>geography was part of my degree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Neill is no stranger to global companies. He began his career in<BR>1974 as an international market research co-ordinator with NV Philips<BR>Gloeilampenfabrieken, the Dutch electronics giant. Two years later, he<BR>moved to Germany to work for Braun AG, the small appliance subsidiary of<BR>Boston-based Gillette Co. From 1978, he was Braun's marketing manager in<BR>Britain until he emigrated to Canada in 1981 as vice-president of<BR>marketing, becoming president of Braun Canada in 1984. During his tenure,<BR>sales increased five-fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, he turned down a promotion that would have taken him back to<BR>Germany and instead took the top job at Rubbermaid Canada Inc., a unit of<BR>Rubbermaid Inc. of Wooster, Ohio. At the time, the parent company was<BR>introducing the sorts of changes that Bata now is adopting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a few years, Mr. O'Neill had awakened Rubbermaid's sleepy<BR>subsidiary, which doubled in size and now boasts sales of more than $100-<BR>million. He helped nurture a cultural change from a conservative,<BR>traditional company to what his successor, Larry Porcellato, calls a high-<BR>performance environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Neill's tenure was characterized by an aggressive approach to<BR>marketing, involving extensive television advertising, and a liberal<BR>application of consumer psychology, Mr. Porcellato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By creating demand for its products, Mr. O'Neill turned Rubbermaid<BR>Canada's fortunes around to the extent that it could operate seven days a<BR>week at a time when it previously would have cut production and reduced<BR>staff, Mr. Porcellato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Neill has brought his abhorrence of layoffs to Bata. &quot;We consider<BR>laying off people as basically bad management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Bata's advertisements trumpet that Keds cost less in Canada than<BR>in the United States, Mr. O'Neill says price slashing is not the whole<BR>game plan. His strategy is to compete on speed rather than cost, an idea<BR>he borrowed from Milliken &amp; Co. of Spartanburg, S.C., a carpet and textile<BR>manufacturer, which cut its production time from 20 weeks to seven days in<BR>order to gain a competitive edge over Asian carpet manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can deliver shoes in 24 hours versus the Chinese who take nine<BR>months, we have a major and significant advantage that has dramatic<BR>implications for all retailers,&quot; he said. &quot;The key is to increase your<BR>stock churns as opposed to just maintaining your gross profit margin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the introduction of electronic data interchange at its plant in<BR>Batawa, Ont., the company will be able to manufacture shoes that will sell<BR>well in the store. &quot;If they're buying size 9s, we'll be making size 9s,&quot;<BR>Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;It's a whole new concept of manufacturing to order<BR>rather than manufacturing to stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy involves just-in-time inventory control and production<BR>circles rather than assembly lines at the plant; rapid-fire decision<BR>making and huddle management rather than a formal reporting mechanism at<BR>head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their goal is to supply shoes as quickly as possible,&quot; said Gary<BR>Alcock, vice-president of public affairs and human resources for rival<BR>Agnew Group Inc. of Brantford, Ont., which operates 342 shoe stores in<BR>three retail chains. &quot;It's questionable as to how this is going to<BR>increase their sales and volume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most alarming from Agnew's perspective is that by price cutting Bata is<BR>giving up margins. &quot;In retail you have to make a profit,&quot; Mr. Alcock said.<BR>&quot;You have to have a future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. O'Neill is convinced of the rightness of his path. &quot;We're just<BR>going to be faster on our feet than any of our competitors. That's our<BR>mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
