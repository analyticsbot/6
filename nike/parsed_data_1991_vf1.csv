"NikeInc. yesterday named Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson to its board of directors.Thompson, aNikespokesman since 1980, becomes the first minority-race board member atNike, which expects $ 3 billion sales in sports and fitness shoes, clothing and accessories for its fiscal year ending May 31.&nbsp;The naming of Thompson follows criticism last July by Operation PUSH and its leader, Jesse Jackson, thatNikewas exploiting blacks and had none in upper management. In August, Operation PUSH urged a boycott ofNikeproducts, andNikepublicly said it would name a black to its board within a year. The next month, Thompson arranged a meeting in his office between Operation PUSH andNikeofficials.&quot;I've had an opportunity to know [Nikechairman] Phil Knight,&quot; Thompson said on a tape provided by Georgetown. &quot;I have a lot of interest and a lot of curiosity, particularly as it applies to the business world.

Strasser and her sister, Laurie Becklund, sound a lot more fun:- The company's name came to one of the founding workers in a dream. (Knight wanted ''Dimension Six.'')-Nikegot its air-cushioned shoes only because it listened to an unemployed aerospace researcher ignored by others.- An art student designed the Swoosh logo for $ 35.But in detailingNike'sups and downs, the authors are instructive. Women, not to mention minorities, were never in the management loop - even asNikewas dismissing the fledgling aerobics craze as ''fat ladies dancing to music.''AndNikeonly survived, arguably, because of early backing from a Japanese creditor - U.S. banks were too timid - and becauseNikeovercame regulatory interference from the U.S. government. Litigation becameNike'sstandard operating procedure.The authors conclude that ''the individualism that madeNikedifferent is gone, but so is the spirit that made employees care.''

Their problem is that the wheels of Spanish justice grind slowly and the Games are just three weeks away.Expansion, the Spanish newspaper that unearthed the ruling, is quoting local representatives of the U.S.Nikecompany as saying the damage to the company would be ''irreversible and irreparable'' if its athletes are not able to sport the company logo during the games.While the ruling does not mean that Michael Jordan will have to compete without his shoes on, it could mean that TV closeups of their victorious heaving chests will be free of advertising. It also meansNikewould have to take down its hoardings in Barcelona and the rest of Spain.&nbsp;Nikewas planning to use the Games to help launch a multimillion-dollar new range of sports clothes in the autumn.It proved impossible Friday to locate the two legal owners of theNikemark in Spain, Juan Amigo Freixas and Flora Bertrand Mata.",-0.128195646946,0.45063973064,282 words,Niketripped up as Olympics near,1992-07-06 00:00:00,98 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Financial Post (Toronto, Canada)"

"NikeDoes It AgainWieden &amp; Kennedy Inc., the Portland, Ore., agency that coined the anthemic phrase &quot;just do it&quot; forNikeInc., has taken its own advice. It has produced one of the year's most admired campaigns -- again.&nbsp;&quot;Nikeis the high-water mark in American advertising,&quot; said Andy Berlin, a principal at Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein in San Francisco.Saluting theNikecampaign's &quot;style and 'cool' factor,&quot; Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, added that Wieden's advertising &quot;isn't just to shock or get attention; it sells the product.&quot;Among this year's lauded ads forNike:a nostalgic, low-key television commercial shown during Super Bowl XXV; print ads that talked to, not at, women, in a sensitive, respectful manner, and a series of humorous &quot;Bo Show&quot; spots, which defied predictions that Bo Jackson's football injury would end his effectiveness as aNikeendorser.&nbsp;Pepsi Gets a Prize SloganDoes Diet Pepsi have the right one, baby? Indubitably. (You were expecting &quot;Uh-huh&quot;?)The slickly produced campaign for the Pepsi-Cola soft drink, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, has spawned an upbeat national catch phrase during a less-than-upbeat year. The campaign's slogan -- &quot;You got the right one baby, uh-huh,&quot; half-sung, half-growled by Ray Charles -- has been added to the vernacular, and has been placed on Diet Pepsi containers. The advertising was &quot;a step ahead,&quot; said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York.The campaign marked another victory in its psychological warfare with Coca-Cola. Coke outsells Pepsi. But Pepsi often out-advertises and out-markets Coke.&quot;For Coca-Cola, I haven't noticed any spots all year,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York. &quot;Yet I've noticed all the Pepsi spots.&quot;&nbsp;Nuprin's Luck With EndorserFinding an outstanding campaign in the pill-and-pain category is like fishing a diamond ring out of a box of Cracker Jack. Yet J. Walter Thompson USA in New York managed that feat with advertising for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Nuprin brand of ibuprofen.&quot;Nupe it with Nuprin,&quot; the campaign urged, and consumers heeded that call to self-medicate, as sales of the brand, previously sluggish, began to rise.The campaign won praise for another rarity, signing a spokesman from the sports world who was actually well suited for the product. Of course, it was sweet serendipity that the endorser, the aging tennis star Jimmy Connors, unexpectedly stormed his way into the U.S. Open semifinals just as the campaign started.One complaint: the unfortunate play on words between &quot;Nupe&quot; and &quot;Nuke.&quot; Some say the campaign works despite that; others say that is exactly what makes the ads work.&nbsp;Auto Themes: Safe and FrugalTwo unorthodox automotive campaigns drew raves, though the plaudits were far from unanimous.For Volvo Cars of North America, Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer in New York played single-mindedly on motorists' anxieties about safety, using the theme &quot;Drive Safely.&quot; It is &quot;the best tagline,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;Very simple and very appropriate.&quot;Some executives were put off by the suggestion that parents who love their children drive only Volvos. Some also saw the campaign's attack on mini-vans as an unfair swipe at Chrysler.The other campaign was for Subaru of America's 1992 models, by Wieden &amp; Kennedy. A refreshing dose of reality infused the campaign, which debunked traditional auto-advertising obsessions with status, power and glamour. One spot, startling in its candor, depicted people who pay a lot for trophy cars as shallow, vain and deep in debt.But the campaign theme, &quot;what to drive,&quot; came under fire. &quot;It takes itself so seriously in trying to be different,&quot; said Marty Weiss, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.&nbsp;Challenge of the 90's: Credit CardsThe red-hot debate raging over the new American Express green card campaign has ad folks arguing until they are blue in the face. For now, color the prevailing judgments dark.Donny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York, belittled the advertising's &quot;spend, spend, spend, isn't-life-fun, yuppie attitude.&quot; He and others cited ads by Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. in New York that celebrate frivolities like flying the Concorde.&quot;The creative strikes me as sophomoric,&quot; said Jay Schulberg, executive vice president and executive creative head of Bozell Inc. in New York.Samuel J. Chisholm, president of the Mingo Group Inc. in New York, is &quot;not sure this approach is direct enough -- and I carry two American Express cards.&quot;Others, less negative, argue that the campaign will evolve. They say it would do better to focus on a theme found in some of the ads, which present the card as a powerful financial tool with flexible spending limits and no revolving-interest charges.&nbsp;Not Much Memorable From DetroitThis was not a good year for Detroit. Nor was it a good year for Detroit's advertising.&quot;It's no wonder G.M. is closing 21 plants, with the kind of advertising they do,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.Among the most castigated campaigns: the muddled, meaningless theme for Oldsmobile, &quot;the power of intelligent engineering,&quot; by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, and the nearly invisible advertising for Chrysler's struggling Plymouth division, by Bozell Inc. in Birmingham, Mich.A notable exception was the advertising by Hal Riney &amp; Partners in San Francisco for General Motors' Saturn division, which was warmly applauded for its intelligent appeals to car buyers.&nbsp;'News' Approach Raises QuestionsA series of television commercials by McCann-Erickson in New York for the Vaseline line of skin-care lotions was cited by some as a dubious achievement in deceit.The spots featured Joan Lunden, the co-host of ABC's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; in what seemed to be news reports on skin care. The spots used elements of news shows, like an anchor desk and on-screen logos, which cloaked their commercial nature.&quot;If you're trying to build credibility for a product, you don't do it by creating a fake news show,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;You're trying to trick me, and I don't like being tricked.&quot;The pitfalls of such spots were underscored on Dec. 19, when one turned up during ABC's news magazine &quot;Prime Time Live.&quot; The network, which had barred the spots from running during news programs, apologized for the error.&nbsp;Testing the Limits on Bare FleshThe notorious, nude-filled advertising supplement for Calvin Klein jeans drew lots of gawkers. Most agreed that the emperor, too, wore no clothes.The supplement, created by Mr. Klein's in-house advertising department, was included in a plastic bag wrapped around selected copies of the October issue of Vanity Fair magazine -- a &quot;polybagged outsert&quot; in the industry's picturesque jargon. Inside, 116 pages of black-and-white photographs depicted pouty young men, pretending to be members of a rock band, preening in various states of undress.It symbolized advertising's never-ending efforts to test the limits in using sex, and skin, to sell products.  But people on both sides of that issue thought the campaign was artless.&quot;It stood for everything that missed the mark,&quot; said Donny Deutsch, creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York. He decried the advertising's supplement's &quot;decadent sexuality&quot; as &quot;so 80's.&quot;Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, termed it &quot;out of touch.&quot; His special peeve: &quot;They didn't show the models how to hold the guitars right.&quot;",0.154986414295,0.544715774769,1315 words,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;In the Year of the Soft Sell: The Subtle and The Dubious,1991-12-27 00:00:00,103 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The New York Times
"&nbsp;The Spanish government has vowed to helpNikeInc. in the trademark dispute threatening to make a shambles of the company's multi-million dollar Olympic ad campaign, officials said.In a letter sent this week to the European Commission, Spanish officials promised to ask a Barcelona judge to allowNiketo post bond in the case, an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism said.That arrangement would allow the Beaverton, Ore., company to sell and advertise its sports apparel in Spain while awaiting a final court decision in the trademark conflict.&nbsp;The letter, however, warns that &quot;the judiciary in Spain is independent of the executive and is not obliged to comply with the request,&quot; the official said.There was no immediate response from the courts.The Commission had asked the Spanish government to helpNikefight the Barcelona judge's standing order prohibiting it from selling clothing in Spain - an injunction that also might prevent the U.S. track and field team from wearingNikeuniforms at the Barcelona Games, which open July 25.Nikepaid a multi-million dollar figure to put its name on the U.S. and Algerian track teams at the Olympics.But just who owns that name is being fiercely disputed in Spain by lawyer Juan Amigo Freixas, who holds aNiketrademark registered in 1932 by a Barcelona sock maker, and Cidesport, a formerNikedistributor that has indirectly acquired marketing rights to Amigo's trademark.Two courts have upheld the Barcelona judge's injunction despite the factNikewas awarded its own trademark in Spain in July 1990.Nikehas estimated it stands to lose $ 20 million in sales in Spain alone - and many times that worldwide - if it cannot advertise its new line of clothing at the Games.OFFICIALS BANNEDAuthorities have banned Ivan Slavkov, head of Bulgaria's Olympic committee and son-in-law of former Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov, from travelling to the Barcelona Olympics.Yordanka Vandova, Slavkov's lawyer, said Wednesday the Sofia prosecutor had issued a letter saying Slavkov's passport was withdrawn July 8, and he could not fly to Barcelona as planned Wednesday.Slavkov, an International Olympic Committee member since 1987, was scheduled to attend an IOC finance meeting in Barcelona today before accompanying Bulgarian athletes at the games, Vandova said.Slavkov was charged with embezzling $ 304 from the Bulgarian Olympic Committee in January, 1990, shortly after his father-in-law was ousted by reform Communists.ATHLETE PUMPEDStella Umeh, the diminutive gymnast bound for Barcelona, looked out over a sea of young faces and let it be known how she felt about a sendoff for Olympic athletes Wednesday afternoon.&quot;This is cool, really cool.&quot;Umeh, all of five feet, 100 pounds, takes off for the Olympic Games today knowing she's no longer a stranger to a bunch of fans in the country's largest city.&quot;This should really be a confidence boost for us,&quot; she said of a barbecue, fashion-show pep rally put on by various Olympic sponsors outside a downtown shopping centre in Toronto. &quot;It's nice to know this many people care about us.&quot;Umeh and her gymnastic teammates depart this morning for Spain.

"NikeInc., which paid millions to put its name on the U.S. track and field team's uniforms at the Barcelona Olympics, is appealing a stunning high court decision that bars the advertising or sale ofNikeapparel in Spain, a company attorney said yesterday.Spain's Constitutional Court last week refused to lift a lower court order prohibiting the Beaverton, Oregon-based sports apparel company from using theNikename on clothing because a Barcelona firm registered the trademark first in 1932.NikeInc., whose shoes are not affected by the ruling, has planned to use the Olympics promotional campaign to launch a new line of sports clothes.&nbsp;If further legal actions fail -- and if the courts rule the injunction bars U.S. athletes from wearingNikeuniforms -- the firm stands to lose $20 million in sales in Spain alone and many times that sum worldwide, according to company documents.&quot;We do not believe we've lost the battle by any means, much less the war,&quot; said John Faylor,Nike'sEuropean lawyer.But the decision clearly leftNikeat a disadvantage in its long-running dispute with Juan Amigo Freixas, the Barcelona lawyer who bought theNikename from the original registrant, who briefly made socks during the 1930s.Amigo has reportedly askedNikefor $30 million for rights to the brand, according to Faylor, who has called the Spaniard a &quot;pirate.&quot;Amigo refused to divulge his demands in a recent interview. He said the injunction would preventNikefrom carrying out its Olympics promotion.Nike, however, claims the decision won't keep athletes from wearing its name when the Games open July 25.The International Olympic Committee does not consider the uniforms to be a form of advertising or promotion, Faylor said in a telephone interview from Frankfurt.The arguments againstNikecould be strong, however.In documents filed with the Constitutional Court and the U.S. Trade Representative,Nikeitself raised the Olympics sponsorship issue to argue that retaining the injunction would cause irreparable damage to the company.And sinceNikepaid millions to The Athletics Congress -- the governing body of U.S. track -- for the right to dress the athletes inNikegear, the Spanish courts may not look kindly on the company's claim that its sponsorship was mere altruism.&quot;Nike'ssponsorship of the U.S. track and field team during the 1992 Olympic Games is a central component ofNike'slong-term international marketing strategy,&quot;Nikeattorneys wrote the Washington-based U.S. Trade Representative in April.The prospect of missing out on the Games is particularly painful since Reebok, a fierce competitor in shoes and apparel, is providing the uniforms that all U.S. athletes -- includingNikespokesman Michael Jordan -- will wear on the awards podium if they win medals.In the meantime,Nikeis hoping the Constitutional Court reverses itself -- quickly, with the Olympics less than three weeks away.The Constitutional Court -- having spoken only onNike'smotion to lift the injunction -- has yet to rule on the validity of Amigo's 60-year-old trademark.",0.0793878517316,0.41604978355,521 words,NikeInc. appeals court ruling,1992-07-07 00:00:00,112 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)"

"Spanish trademark laws are threatening to turnNike'ssponsorship of the U.S. Olympic track-and-field team into a multi-million-dollar fiasco.&nbsp;NikeInc. is in the midst of a court battle with a Spanish attorney who owns theNikename in Spain - first registered here 60 years ago by a Barcelona sock maker.With the Olympics less than six weeks away andNikeplanning to plaster its disputed name on U.S. athletes' uniforms, the company and the attorney, Juan Amigo Freixas, are playing a game of courtroom chicken. Whoever swerves first is likely to lose tens of millions of dollars.&nbsp;Pressure is building on both sides:Nike, an American sports shoe and apparel giant based in Beaverton, Ore., wants to clear up the matter before the July 25 opening ceremony. Amigo, who says the athletes can't use theNikename without his permission, knows his payoff will shrink after the games end.Amigo ''should be aware that it would result in a very unpleasant embarrassment for the Kingdom of Spain,'' said John Faylor,Nike'sEuropean counsel. ''Juan Amigo is a pirate, as we see him, who's using the . . . trademark to blackmailNikeinto a negotiating position andNikerefuses to submit to those kinds of tactics.''At stake are the profitsNikehoped to reap when it paid a handsome sum - the company won't say how much - to hitch its name to the U.S. athletes.&nbsp;Nikedocuments put potential sales losses at US$20 million in Spain alone and many times that amount worldwide.To make matters worse forNike, competitor Reebok's logo will be on the sweatsuit of every American who steps to the winner's podium in Barcelona, includingNikespokesman Michael Jordan, should the U.S. basketball team take a medal.At the heart of the dispute are Spain's idiosyncratic commercial laws, which have generated an array of cases involving foreign firms that entered the Spanish market only to find someone else already owned their brands.Trademark laws here long permitted anyone to register and renew a name simply by paying a fee, even if they never produced anything.The statutes were changed in 1988 to permit easier challenges to inactive trademarks, but registrants still aren't required to prove they have an ongoing business or product when filing an application.''Trademark piracy is practically the national sport in Spain,'' Faylor said by telephone from Frankfurt.''Nikehas been one of the many trademark companies that have experienced harassment.''Is it piracy? Or just smart business?''They can think what they want,'' Amigo said from Barcelona. ''If the Olympics hadn't come to Spain,Nikewould never have landed here because they wouldn't know where Spain was.''Amigo bought theNikename from the original owner, who produced knitted wear during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and kept the trademark - a photographic negative of the headless Winged Victory of Samothrace statue in the Louvre Museum - long after production ceased.The registration applies only to sports apparel, not shoes - but it's the U.S. track team's shirts and shorts that will be most visible to television cameras.In July 1990,Nikewas issued a registration for its name and ''swoosh'' symbol, but two Spanish courts upheld Amigo's earlier trademark. The Constitutional Court is now consideringNike'sappeal.At one point, Amigo askedNikefor US$30 million for rights to the brand, Fraylor said. Amigo refused to divulge any figures.''He's trying to basically take advantage of what he has,'' said the U.S. official.GRAPHIC:Photo: Michael Jordan teamed up with Bugs Bunny forNikeSuper Bowl ads in January, but there's a chance he won't be able to wearNikelogos at the Barcelona Olympics.",0.0579636591479,0.453070175439,597 words,Nikefacing Olympian battle,1992-06-18 00:00:00,184 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Financial Post (Toronto, Canada)"
"Two makers of athletic shoes and sports wear reported widely divergent financial results today.NikeInc. of Beaverton, Ore., reported its fifth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings, while L.A. Gear Inc. of Los Angeles reported a loss for its second quarter.Both companies' stock moved sharply on the news.Nikeshares jumped more than 10 percent, closing at $66.375, up $6.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. And L.A. Gear slid more than 13 percent, closing at $10.625, off $1.625.&nbsp;Philip H. Knight,Nike'schairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company was well positioned to continue its growth.&quot;A 17 percent increase in future orders for the next six months sets the stage for another record year in 1993,&quot; Mr. Knight said. &quot;This increase reflects U.S. retailers' continued success withNikeproducts in an otherwise difficult retail environment.&quot; He added thatNikewas also strong in Europe.L.A. Gear said its loss stemmed partly from the cost of settling three separate consolidated shareholder suits, as well as a loss from continuing operations.&quot;The company's new management is continuing its efforts during this transition year to redirect the company, both operationally and financially,&quot; said Stanley P. Gold, L.A. Gear's chairman and chief executive.Following are details of the companies' results:&nbsp;NikeFor the fourth quarter, which ended May 31,Nikesaid it earned $70.7 million, or 92 cents a share, up 20.6 percent from $58.6 million, or 76 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues rose 17.9 percent, to $847.6 million, from $719.0 million in the fourth quarter of the 1991 fiscal year.For the year,Nikehad earnings of $329.2 million, or $4.30 a share, up 14.7 percent from $287.0 million, or $3.77 a share, in the 1991 fiscal year. Revenues rose 13.7 percent, to $3.41 billion, from $3 billion in the previous year.&quot;The Olympic Games will further showcaseNike'sproducts and athletes to a truly global audience,&quot; Mr. Knight said. &quot;Seven of the 12 U.S.A. Basketball Team players and 66 of the 129 track and field qualifiers areNikeathletes.&quot;&nbsp;L.A. GearFor its second quarter, which ended May 31, L.A. Gear had a deficit of $24.4 million, up substantially from a loss of $4 million in the period a year ago. Sales fell 36.9 percent, to $104.7 million, from $166 million in the second quarter of the 1991 fiscal year.The loss for the quarter reflects a $13.87 million after-tax charge for the settlement of the shareholder suits. The company attributed the decline in earnings to a drop in the number of shoes sold worldwide.

"&nbsp;NIKEAND THE BARE ESSENTIALSTHE sportswear firm,Nike(Greek for victory), has not enjoyed the best of times at the Olympics. Michael Johnson, subject of a large advertising campaign byNike,flopped in the 200 metres, while anotherNikestar, Sergei Bubka, failed to reach the qualifying heights in the pole vault. At leastNikewill not be upstaged by rivals Reebok tonight. Reebok has a deal with the United States Olympic Committee to provide tracksuits for all US medal-winners to be worn on the podium. This agreement has caused problems for six of the ''dream team'', including Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, who are contracted toNikefor seven-figure sums. Eventually a compromise was reached. So if - or rather when - Jordan, Barkley and Co win gold tonight, the medal ceremony should be fun. Apart from the sight of the chosen dignitary straining to place medals around the necks of near 7ft-tall athletes, some of the basketballers will be revealing some chest. The reason for the unzipped tracksuit tops? So the collars can fold down and conceal the Reebok logo.NAME the one football video that is available in the club boardroom, but not in the club shop?

''Vinnie Jones - the tackles''?&nbsp;CLEAR OBJECTIVEA daunting task for batsmen - clearing the Lord's pavilion - has been turned into a competition. A cheque for pounds 1,000 is the reward for any cricketer who carries the beautiful old building, a feat achieved once, by Albert Trott (via a chimney pot) for the MCC against the Australians in 1899. The Cricket Lore Challenge, organised by the cricket magazine, is open until 1999, the centenary of Trott's achievement. Many have tried to emulate Trott's feat, players like Keith Miller, Kim Hughes, Wasim Akram and Mike Llewellyn. Llewellyn came closest, in the 1977 Gillette Cup final for Glamorgan against Middlesex, when he hoisted a delivery from John Emburey - it rose high enough but caught the top of the north tower.WE ALL know Olympic medals bring their rewards. Fame for all, fortune for a few. And some new friends for Shannon Miller. The 15-year-old gymnast who is returning home to Edmond, Oklahoma, with three medals has aroused a lot of interest. ''Young men are calling from all over the country trying to get her phone number,'' an Edmond civic official said. ''One little guy from Denver has probably called seven or eight times today. He says it's a real emergency.''RACING'S RICHESThe glamour of the turf . . . prizes at Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi, are a bit different from those at Kentucky and Epsom. A bucket pump was the top reward in the first race; race three offered a backpack sprayer; race four, a maize hand shredder; race five, a wheel barrow; and the concluding feature race of the evening promised a milk churn.WHETHER FORECASTSTo commemorate what they call the ''dawning of a new age'', those wags at the football fanzine, When Saturday Comes, have produced a souvenir poster of the ''all-singing, all-dancing Premier League''.

At No 1 they have a South African, while the 12 others in the squad comprise seven from France, two from Australia, plus three from Italy. The line-up from Paradise is, of course, the new Celtic wine- list, the top bottle being the ''Celtic Champagne'' attractively priced at pounds 15.95. Other footballing essentials in the Parkhead catalogue include a hamper (''with red and white Celtic house wine''), tartan dungarees, an exclusive mountain bike (which would last three seconds outside Ibrox, covered as it is with Celtic emblems), cameras, telephones, binoculars, decanters. Oh, and football kit.DIVIDED LOYALTIESSachin Tendulkar, Yorkshire's Indian tyro, has come up with a variation on the dilemma of county v country - he may be playing for his county against his country next week in a pyjama series in Sheffield.

"Barry Bonds is arguably the best player in baseball, but before Wednesday's game the Pittsburgh outfielder seemed a little envious of Deion Sanders's new multi-year deal withNike.He told his good friend and two-sport star, &quot;I'll just take $ 100 and some shoes.&quot;&nbsp;Sanders will get much more than that after signing on earlier in the day with the shoe giant that has helped make mega-stars of Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson.NeitherNikenor Sanders's agent, Eugene Parker, would discuss financial terms of the multi-year deal.

"THE threat of war hangs over the 25th Olympic Games in Barcelona. A trade war, in fact.Nike, the US sports shoe manufacturer, has found to its chagrin that becoming an official patron of the Games buys no favours in Spain.A Barcelona judge has ruled the multinational company may not advertise or distribute its products in Spain. The case was brought by the Catalan firm of Cidesport, a family company which has held rights of theNiketrademark in Spain since 1932.Now President George Bush's office has intervened, through international trade spokeswoman Carla Hill, to register its anger with Spain's Ministry of Trade and Industry.The US has now put Spain firmly on the list of countries which could suffer reprisals if it continues to impose protective measures against the company which is based in Portland, Oregon (which Bush hopes to carry in November's Presidential election.)&nbsp;Sergei Bubka, and Michael Jordan are among the American firms' best-known sponsored athletes. Undeterred,Nikesays its leading athletes will wear its products because they are not for sale in Spain.Lawyers for SpanishNikesay the police are entitled to enforce compliance with the law - thereby raising the spectacle of the US men's relay team running barefoot |With commercial sponsorship of athletes reaching grotesque levels at these Games, it's unlikely eitherNikewill back down.TERRORIST FEARTHE Games have occasioned the biggest police exercise in Spain since the rule of fascist dictator Franco. More than 30,000 policemen are keeping watch from helicopters, tanks, motorbikes, patrol cars and unmarked vehicles.Some security men are even in the harbour and off the coast in navy submarines.Operations are being directed from a $1 million purpose-built bunker, centre of a closed-circuit video network filming the stadium and tracks, the Olympic village and the city's main streets.The main fear is a headline-grabbing military operation by members of ETA, the ultra-nationalist group seeking independence for the Basque country in northern Spain.With many ETA activists in jail in both France and Spain, Barcelonans are praying for a trouble-free Olympics.In the hot seat is Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera who boasted in Parliament that recent arrests probably left only one active ETA commando unit in Spain. That's fine, Jose, but where is it?After two years of efforts to reach a truce, the Spanish Government evidently felt strong enough to maintain an official silence in the face of a recent truce offer from ETA leaders.Last week two Basque political parties, Herri Batasuna and Eusko Alkartasuna, signed a joint pact and wrote to Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and French President Francois Mitterrand demanding recognition of the Basques' right to self-determination.If ETA and the Basques behave during the Games, the Spanish Government has let it be known, ever so unofficially, that it will make some &quot;tactical, conciliatory gestures&quot; to the Basque nation.TOUCHY SUBJECTIT is not Basque terrorists but the regional government of Catalonia(capital Barcelona) which is causing most embarrassment to Spanish authorities.Jordi Pujol, head of Catalonia's Council, has outraged Madrid by campaigning in the European press for recognition of Catalonia. One full-page advertisement declared Catalonia was &quot;a country within Spain which has been able to bring the Olympics to its capital, Barcelona&quot;.Pujol's campaign has led to an outcry from the Madrid Government which points out that the central government has borne more than 50 per cent of the cost.In his visit last week to the Olympic village where his son, Felipe, is a member of Spain's yachting team, King Juan Carlos made no direct reference to the controversy. But he did remark that the Games were &quot;of transcendental importance in the history of Spain&quot;.Pujol, unrepentant, accused Spain's ruling Socialist Party of&quot;criminalising Catalan nationalism&quot;. The lofty ideals of the Olympics are unlikely to heal the breach.A hardy contingent of sports fans from Australia have fallen at the first Olympic hurdle - the language barrier.&quot;Jeez, mate,&quot; complained one Aussie, &quot;it's hard to get around over here. No-one speaks Australian.&quot;It reminded me of the old bloke from Coogee who went on a world tour soon after retiring. Back at the bowling club eight weeks' later someone asked him how it had gone.&quot;It was OK,&quot; he said grudgingly, &quot;except there were too many New Australians.&quot;HUMAN FAILUREWHILE the Games are in the stadiums, Barcelona's Science Museum is not to be outdone. It is staging an exhibition of sports simulation which enables visitors to experience the thrill of the grand slalom or the pole vault, for example, without actually moving.As well, the exhibition features comparisons between human athletic records and the achievements of the animal kingdom. This shows that no animal has jumped as high as the kangaroo (3.3 metres); that only Sergei Bubka, with his 6.13m pole vault, has jumped higher than a dolphin, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger swinging on a rope exerts a force of 100kg, less than one-third of that achieved by your average chimpanzee.I wonder if our Science Museum could mount a similar exercise comparing the intelligence of animals and, say, politicians. Just a thought.HOTSHOTSTHE hidden factor of these Games may well prove to be the heat. It is sweltering. Temperatures over the past week have swung between 30 to 38 degrees.Spain's own Olympic football team has been suffering. Being blow-wave Iberians, a sports psychologist, Dr Jesus Garcia Barrero, was called in to help cool them down. My tip is that the sun-parched Moroccans, Algerians, Ethiopians and Kenyans will star in the track events. Give the Icelanders and Finns a miss this year.DAYLIGHT ROBBERYIT comes as no surprise to learn that the Spaniards gave us the word pirata which we translate as pirate. I visited an official money-changing office which carried a table in the window offering 178 pesetas for each Pound 1 sterling. I changed Pound 50 and discovered to my horror I had received only 161 pesetas per Pound .When I protested I was insolently told the higher rate was only for transactions worth 500,000 pesetas or more. I got my money back but only after a furious row involving a threat to call the police.Barcelona's restaurateurs have also gone mad. As of last week their eateries became - officially - the highest priced in all of Spain. Their bonanza may be shortlived. One hotel chain owner predicted in El Mundo last week that half of the city's restaurants will fold after the three-week GamesHARD YAKKA |IN Seville, the Australian Consul ate is housed in the British Institute.

"A yearlong dispute regarding the use of Michael Jordan's likeness on NBA sportswear has been resolved in principle - without litigation or arbitration - to the satisfaction of His Airness,Nikeand the league.But, according to Doug Stamms,Nike'smarketing attorney, ''The ink is not dry yet.''Deputy commissioner Russell Granik is comfortable, though. He saysNike,Jordan and the NBA are ''finding a way to live together and prosper.''&nbsp;The three parties worked out their differences as they applied to the Olympics and have now dealt with broader issues pertaining to league merchandising.For whatever it's worth (David Stern is on call to caddy for Michael), the league has retained the right to market Jordan's likeness.Had it not, the NBA probably would've substituted Mirage hotel and casino owner Steve Wynn.&nbsp;MAGIC FORMULA: Nobody says it better than columnist Dan Shaughnessy. For example, in Tuesday's Boston Globe, he noted, ''Magic Johnson has said the same things so many times that even Arsenio will have a hard time pretending he's hearing the stuff for the first time.''Then again, Magic has said so many things so many different ways, the truth is often ignored in the process.Out of one side of his mouth, Magic fingered the Cavaliers for allegedly backing off him because of a bandaged scratch on his arm, a premise Craig Ehlo and Cleveland teammates labeled absurd.Out of the other side, Magic tried to lay guilt trips on Suns owner Jerry Colangelo and Karl Malone for voicing concerns regarding the risk of playing against Johnson, who's infected with the AIDS virus. According to Magic's warped logic, their ulterior motive was to ice the competition.To be perfectly blunt, Magic's assertion that Malone's comments influenced his decision is sheer twisted wreckage.Immediately following his final retirement, he was quoted extensively as saying he didn't even know what Malone said until 36 hours after his decision. Shortly thereafter, he created a more convenient story line.In the last couple weeks, I figure Magic has been fawned over by the national media roughly a dozen times in his effort to sell his book to people who'll buy anything and to document his world-class athleticism for womanizing.Not once has an interviewer refuted Magic on the Malone discrepancy or other bogus contentions. Not once has one challenged his preposterous Cavaliers theory. Not once has anyone questioned his supposed concern for others as a factor in his retirement, when, in reality, the only person he ever really has been concerned about is himself.&nbsp;CLIFF NOTES: As far as I know, Cliff Robinson is the only player in the league who plays three frontcourt positions every night and defends them all with honor. Occasionally, he must even clamp down on a particularly hot off guard.Each season, the 6-9 Trail Blazers' minutes, blocks, steals, rebounds, scoring, (turnovers), field goal and free throw percentages improve. Yet his lack of recognition is constant.Each season, Robinson plays in every exhibition, every regular-season game (251 and counting) and every playoff game (58) and doesn't fool around in any of 'em. Yet his durability, versatility and competitive spirit are largely ignored.Each season, the Blazers have advanced well into the playoffs, and Robinson's role has increased. Yet each time ballots are cast for best sixth man, most improved or best defensive player, he's one step removed from an afterthought.How can that be? It must be because Cliff has such a hard last name to remember compared to vote getters such as Sarunas Marciulionis, Detlef Schrempf and Dan Majerle.&nbsp;WONDERLAND: That's not all I'm wondering about today:- I mean, is Larry Bird working in Boston's front or back office?- Shouldn't the Nets be thinking of getting Vernon ''Can't we all just get along?'' Maxwell to enhance their chemistry?- Think Clifford Ray gets visibly excited about a comeback each time he reads a Warriors box score? How about Martha Raye?- Does the Hornets' Allan Bristow entertain any plans of getting into coaching this season?- Will the Hornets' Johnny Newman's field goal attempts dip to fewer than 15 a game now that he has broken his shooting hand?- Have the Hornets really replaced Newman with David Wingate? Who's his agent, Marion Barry?- Since the Celtics obviously have to do something (signing first- rounder Jon Barry to a fair contract is too easy), I wonder who'll be the lucky unrestricted free agent VP Dave Gavitt falls in love with but won't pursue?

"For advertisers, 1990 was a strange year. Early on, the outlook was rosy. Ads glowed with glasnost to celebrate historic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But by fall, ads addressed more somber topics - a souring economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.

The best of the best was ''Bo's family reunion.'' Few thoughtNikecould top its ''Bo knows'' spots, among the best ads of 1989.

Targets in '90: ads for air fresheners, long-distance telephone service, soft drinks and hemorrhoid remedies.Most hilarious: an ad that simultaneously made fun of foreign films and coming attractions. It took the form of a preview for a make-believe movie called Dance with Your Feet. To complete the illusion, the ad ran in movie theaters as well as on TV.

Rudy Boschwitz.One ad, ''Looking for Rudy,'' was based on the comic documentary Roger &amp; Me. The ad followed Wellstone as he searched in vain for Boschwitz so they could debate.Another ad, ''Fast-paced Paul,'' presented Wellstone cramming all his positions into a single 30-second spot. The rapid spiel was necessary, the ad explained, because Wellstone couldn't match Boschwitz's ad budget.

"Inside a suite in New York City's Grand Hyatt hotel, three of America's most celebrated black sports and entertainment figures were trying to make peace with Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil rights organization. Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson was there. So was actor/filmmaker Spike Lee. And Chicago Bulls all-star guard Michael Jordan.&nbsp;The three celebrities gathered on a Sunday evening last September as paid representatives ofNikeInc., the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company. Their mission: End the boycott PUSH had called againstNiketo protest its minority hiring and business practices.The meeting was scheduled afterNikeChairman Phil Knight failed to satisfy PUSH during a widely publicized session in August on the Georgetown campus. &quot;It was John Thompson's idea,&quot; Knight said of the New York meeting. &quot;I was complaining to John that we weren't getting anywhere in negotiations. John's line to me was, 'You think too much like a white man. Let me go negotiate with them.' &quot;But the negotiations failed -- and the two sides haven't met since. Now, as the largely unsuccessful boycott continues, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who founded PUSH, refers toNike'sblack endorsers as &quot;shoe salesmen&quot; who seem more interested in making money than &quot;fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;PUSH officials complain thatNike-- though its annual retail sales to black consumers total hundreds of millions of dollars -- has no high-ranking black executives and does no business with black-owned banks and advertising agencies. According toNike, 320 (7.5 percent) of its 4,243 U.S.-based employees are black. Blacks account for about 4 percent of the population of metropolitan Portland, Ore., whereNikeis based.Nikehas announced it will hire a minority vice president this year and name a minority to its board of directors by 1992. Knight said the appointments probably will be black. &quot;If we were perfect, we would've gotten that taken care of sooner,&quot; he said, adding thatNikewas formed in 1972 as a small, &quot;too male and too white&quot; company.Thompson, a $ 200,000-plus-a-yearNikeconsultant, said no organization has a right to tell another how to do business. Jackson responded in a recent interview: &quot;That detachment from ethical responsibility, that detachment from racial justice, as opposed to personal aggrandizement, is not in the best tradition of fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;The boycott has had little apparent effect onNike, whose earnings soared 58 percent last September, October and November over the corresponding period in 1989.

Analysts had been expecting the company to earn about 97 cents. ''The results were a little disappointing,'' says Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. ''It appears thatNikeis losing momentum.''&nbsp;The company cited higher expenses related to the introduction of new products such as the Air 180 running shoe. Expenses rose to 22.7% of revenue from 19.9%. Revenue in the period rose 39% to $ 802 million.Nikesaid it plans to continue its ''aggressive'' marketing campaigns.Nikeinventories rose 121% in the period, suggesting sales are slowing dramatically, notes Mike Shea, analyst at Black &amp; Co. Overall orders rose 12%, led by apparel (up 17%) and overseas footwear (up 43%). But domestic shoe orders, which account for more than 60% of sales, were flat. ''That's a red flag,'' Shea says, adding that he recommends selling the stock if you own it.Meanwhile, the nation's No. 3 athletic-shoe maker, L.A. Gear, had better news. It restructured loan agreements with major lenders. L.A. Gear shares rose 1 to $ 13 1/2.

With Jackson, the baseball/football star the shoe company currently has under contract, facing an uncertain future because of hip-replacement surgery,Nikeis trying to negotiate a multiyear deal with Sanders, the Braves outfielder and Falcons cornerback.&nbsp;Both Sanders and his agent, Eugene Parker, acknowledge a deal may be close, but neither will discuss specifics.Dusty Kidd, the public relations director forNikeInc., would comment only in general. &quot;It would be dangerous to compare Bo Jackson to any other athlete,&quot; he said. &quot;It's sort of like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. One is vastly more recognized than the other. Every athlete has their own identity.&quot;Deion's market has never been tested,&quot; he said. &quot;For a while last year I don't think people really thought of him as a two-sport player because he had spent most of his time in the minors in baseball. But the way he has started has changed people's mind s,and people have this romance with players who participate in two sports.&quot;Sanders, asked the range of money aNikedeal might reach, said, &quot;It's more than my football contract.&quot; Sanders is coming up on the last year of his four-year deal with the Falcons, which will pay him $ 750,000.Sanders does not have any major endorsements, but Parker said equipment maker Mizuno, among others, has talked to his client.Parker also saidNikeapproached Sanders before the baseball season started, and Sanders's fast start would appear to give him some negotiating leverage with the shoe giant.GRAPHIC:Photo: Deion Sanders Asked how much aNikedeal might pay, he replied, &quot;More than my football contract.&quot;",0.093125,0.39875,264 words,BASEBALL: THE BRAVESNikeknows Deion: Shoe deal in works,1992-04-29 00:00:00,284 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

"&nbsp;Nikeplans to tap the women's market in a big way. Sylvia Wong reportsFROM next year, women can look forward to a new range ofNikesports accessories fashioned just for them.Ironically, they have Reebok,Nike'sarch-rival, to thank for this.  Reebok's colourful and fashionable sports shoes, which took the world by storm in 1985, have madeNikesee that women want sports goods not just for sports but also as fashion accessories.&nbsp;So, the company -which exhorts couch potatoes and athletes alike to &quot;Just Do It&quot; -is launching a new range of shoes, tights, leotards, swimming costumes and other accessories. The range is aimed at women who are likely to buy totally coordinated outfits.John Chew, managing director ofNikeSingapore Pte Ltd, said the firm had to make its women's shoes less chunky and more colourful to match Reebok's appeal.Because women were less inclined to shop at sports outlets,Nikewould set up women's corners in department stores, Mr Chew said. The company would open 10 such corners in Orchard Road department stores next year.He said the women's market, which now accounts for only 12 per cent ofNike'sturnover in Singapore, was expected to double next year after the new range comes out.  But he declined to discloseNike'stotal turnover for Singapore.While women customers are getting more attention now,Nike'slargest customer base remains the men and &quot;authentic athletes&quot;. Its best-selling shoes are those in its running range, followed by cross trainers, basketball and tennis shoes.Mr Chew said running shoes accounted for as much as 30 per cent of local turnover. AmongNike'smost popular models are the Huarache, Air Max and Pegasus models. The company will bring in an improved version of its Air Max model next year. The Air Max Plus will have an air cushion all around the sole of the shoe and will retail at slightly more than $ 200 a pair.Oregon-basedNikeInc reckons it has the largest share of the global sporting goods market.  For the year ended Nov 30, 1991, it said worldwide sales jumped 20 per cent from the previous year to US$ 3.2 billion (S$ 5.1 billion).Reebok International, its closest competitor, chalked up sales of US$ 2.7 billion for the same period while German brand Adidas was third with worldwide sales of about US$ 2.1 billion.Nike'slatest results show that for the quarter ended Aug 31, the company earned US$ 122.5 million, while sales grew 16 per cent to US$ 1.09 billion compared with US$ 947 million in the same period last year.In Singapore, turnover has doubled in the past two years sinceNikeset up its wholly-owned subsidiary,NikeSingapore, to handle its own marketing and distribution.  Before this,Nikewas distributed by Robertson Wilson.Mr Chew said the advantage ofNike'slocal agency was that it could focus its energies on selling onlyNikeproducts. Having a wholly-owned local agency also enabledNiketo carry out unique marketing strategies like its &quot;Ekins&quot; (Nikespelled backwards) programme.The local company employed three Ekins, whose job is to go round to sports clubs, corporations, schools and uniformed groups to advise people on how to buyNikeshoes.&quot;Consumers usually buy on the basis of colour but Ekins try to educate them that they should buy shoes suited to their feet. For example, people with flat feet, high arched feet or normal arched feet require different shoes,&quot; Mr Chew said.Nikealso took over the display of its products in the shops of its 100 dealers in Singapore. The local company provided display stands and signs to shops to control the image of its products.Mr Chew said that in Singapore it was a close fight betweenNikeand Reebok for the market leader position. Last year,Nikespent $ 1 million advertising its well known tag-lines like &quot;There is no finish line&quot; and &quot;Just Do It&quot; to match Reebok's &quot;The Physics Behind the Physique&quot;.Nike'sad spending would rise by up to 20 per cent this year, Mr Chew said.The company has already lined up a series of new ads from the US, which will be screened soon.GRAPHIC:Who says women are the weaker sex?;NikeSingapore MD John Chew: the firm is launching a new range of sport accessories for women",0.0132744107744,0.347149270483,1240 words,Nikewants more women to &quot;just do it',1992-10-08 00:00:00,316 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Business Times (Singapore)
"When the National Sporting Goods Association's World Sports Expo&nbsp;opens a four-day run in Chicago July 15,Nikewill be conspicuous by its&nbsp;absence - and Atlanta's annual Super Show is the primary reason.&quot;We figured we were seeing 95 percent of the same people we'd&nbsp;already seen at the Super Show,&quot; said Mikal Peveto,Nike'smarketing&nbsp;manager/running apparel, in Atlanta this week for the Peachtree Road&nbsp;Race. &quot;We looked at the cost - we were spending $ 4 million in Chicago -&nbsp;and decided to put that back into the retail segment.&quot;Instead, that money will be spent on flying representatives of&nbsp;Nike'stop 100 accounts to its home office in Portland for an annual&nbsp;sales message, new product displays and other programs aimed at the&nbsp;retail market.&nbsp;Nikewill get plenty of exposure from a recently completed agreement&nbsp;with The Athletics Congress (TAC) in which the company will provide&nbsp;uniforms for the U.S. teams participating in the Pan American Games in&nbsp;Cuba, the World Track and Field Championships in Tokyo and the 1992&nbsp;Olympics in Barcelona.According to Peveto, the company will supply shoes and apparel to&nbsp;TAC, but not money.&quot;We will supply radical, bold uniforms, but uniforms that at the&nbsp;same time will be respectful of the games and the country,&quot; Peveto said.&nbsp;&quot;Nike'sphilosophy is to push the envelope, so the public will see a bold&nbsp;interpretation of our nation's colors.

"&nbsp;NikeInc., the world's largest footwear and sports apparel company, boldly stepped forward last week and bailed out the flagging Ben Hogan Tour when it signed a multiyear partnership with the PGA Tour.Nikethus assumes sponsorship of pro golf's premier satellite tour.  In doing so,Nikein effect allowed the financially struggling Ben Hogan Co.  off the hook.  Last year the Hogan Co. asked the PGA Tour to be released from its sponsorship, and it appeared for a time that pro golf might lose the closest thing it had to a feeder system.  TheNikeTour will commence in 1993 and will be structured almost identically to the Hogan Tour with a 30-tournament schedule of $100,000 to $200,000 tournaments.  The Hogan Co., based in Fort Worth, Texas, was part of the Minoru Isutani conglomerate (which also included the Pebble Beach Co.). The conglomerate crumbled earlier this year. Last spring the Hogan Co. became part of the AMF Cos.  Since 1990, the Hogan Co. had committed $3.5 million annually to the Hogan Tour but found it increasingly difficult to keep up the payments in light of its parent company's travails.  The PGA Tour courted potential sponsors. It had been rumored that Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and Buick were interested, but nothing materialized.Nikestepped in at the last moment with what was reported to be a major financial commitment. TheNikeTour figures to prosper indefinitely in this new arrangement.  Whereas the Hogan Co. suffered losses last year reported to be $30 million,Nikeboasted revenue of $3.4 billion for its most recent fiscal year.&nbsp;Nikegot its first exposure to golf in 1983 in the form of golf shoes.  Since then, it has increased its exposure through affiliations with several PGA Tour players. Now it figures to reap enormous benefits on the advertising and marketing fronts.  The 1992 Hogan Tour will generate approximately $4.3 million in prize money, which represents a 41 percent increase over 1990.  Naturally, PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman is delighted with the new affiliation. ''Nike'scommitment ensures (this tour) will remain a vital part of the PGA Tour for years to come,'' he said.

"While the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan tries to blow the Los Angeles Lakers off the basketball court in the NBA finals, an Arlington inventor is putting on a full-court press against one of Jordan's biggest backers,NikeInc.Charles Petrosky, a 73-year-old inventor who works out of a cluttered shop in his basement, claims in a federal suit in Alexandria that the manufacturing giant swiped his invention when it marketed the Air Jordan sneaker, named after the Bulls' star guard.&quot;There's no doubtNikeknew about Mr. Petrosky and his idea for an air cushion sole before the introduction of the Air Max and the Air Jordan,&quot; said Joel M. Freed, Petrosky's attorney. Freed said his client patented an air cushion sole in 1978 and tried to sell the idea toNikelong before it first marketed the Air Jordan in the 1980s.&nbsp;The suit has been compared by attorneys on both sides to the case of a former Maryland man who accused several carmakers of stealing his idea for an intermittent windshield wiper now used on millions of vehicles. The Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay inventor Robert W. Kearns $ 10.2 million in that suit.Petrosky's suit, which is not expected to come to trial until the fall, seeks what could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties and penalties.Nikesaid it has sold millions of pairs of Air Jordans at a retail price of more than $ 100 a pair.Nike'srepresentatives said its Air Jordan and Air Max shoes bear little resemblance to the air cushion sole patented by Petrosky.&quot;If you look at his proposed system and you look atNike's, no one would say they are the same,&quot; said Leslie A. Nicholson, one ofNike'sattorneys.  &quot;More importantly, they work very differently.&quot;Nicholson also said that Petrosky's invention &quot;is remarkably similar&quot; to an air cushion sole patented in the early 1900s and that the suit may raise the question of whether Petrosky's shoe should have been awarded a patent.Petrosky's sole has several chambers that are connected by tiny holes. The chambers are filled using the kind of air pump and needle used to inflate basketballs.Nike'sair cushions are sealed plastic bladders that are inserted into the sole of the shoe.The theory behind each is that when the wearer walks heel to toe, the cushions redistribute the air so that the contours always provide support and a comfortable fit.Nikerepresentative Lindsay D. Stewart conceded that &quot;the little guy-big guy phenomenon&quot; is a factor in the Petrosky case and that a jury might hold more sympathy for the &quot;basement shop-style&quot; inventor.Petrosky, who was hospitalized recently for infections in his cardiovascular system, said he was eager to return to his beloved basement workshop on North Jefferson Street. Though he was given last rites recently, he has improved, and doctors have given him a favorable prognosis.&quot;When I get to feeling better, I'm going to get back at it,&quot; Petrosky said from his bed in Arlington Hospital. He said he continues to have new ideas and yearns for the days when he would &quot;get up at 2 o'clock in the morning and go down to the basement and tinker around.&quot;Petrosky's tinkering dates to the late 1940s, when he was discharged from the Army after World War II and he and a friend opened a barbershop in the Ballston area.He dreamed up a razor strop that was mounted on a support beam so the barber could sharpen his straight razor without having to use two hands. Charles T. Petrosky, the inventor's 38-year-old son, said his father failed to patent the gadget and was angry when he later saw a mounted strop advertised in a trade journal.&quot;It was the fish that got away,&quot; the inventor's son said.From then on -- especially when the elder Petrosky retired from cutting hair in 1975 -- the inventor was far more mindful of patenting his ideas. He was awarded nine patents over the years, including one for a ring with a small blade attached that could be used in self-defense and another for a system designed to rid cities of rats.Petrosky's son said his father invented the ring because he was concerned about increasing urban violence and assaults against women. &quot;If a woman slapped someone across the face with the ring on, it would scratch them -- mark them -- so that police could identify them easier,&quot; he said.The &quot;classic better rat trap&quot; sat on the bed of a truck and used bait to lure rats out of alleys, up a ramp and into a chamber where they could not escape. &quot;All the man would have to do is drop by in the morning and pick up the truck,&quot; Petrosky's son said. While the truck was being driven away, the rats would be killed by fumes pumped into the chamber from the truck's exhaust, he said.Neither invention captured consumers' imaginations, and though a few rings were manufactured, none was ever sold, Petrosky's son said.&quot;I just never got off the ground in marketing,&quot; the elder Petrosky said.Freed refused to let the Petroskys discuss the inspiration for the air cushion sole because of the lawsuit. But a 1978 newspaper article said Petrosky had pinned his hopes for fame and fortune on what he described as a &quot;walking-on-air&quot; shoe.&quot;You take a common football needle and hand air pump, and just pump away,&quot; he told the now-defunct Washington Star. &quot;A gunky substance inside seals it when you remove the needle. It's a million-dollar idea.&quot;",0.0581161616162,0.440868686869,893 words,"Inventor,NikeTo Go 1-on-1 ;Va.

"&nbsp;IN Swoosh: The Unauthorized Story ofNikeand the Men Who Played There, authors J.B. Strasser and Laurie Becklund say the Fortune 500 running-shoe company started by Philip Knight seemed destined to fail in the early days.

Knight demanded to know who signed the guy so the idiot could be fired.&nbsp;* The authors describe executive retreats, known as &quot;Buttfaces,&quot; enlivened by drinking marathons. And atNike'sfirst national sales conference, a rep from Texas did a brisk business selling marijuana pipes to colleagues.* WhenNikedecided to establish a new manufacturer in Korea, a company exec flew to Seoul and asked the desk clerk at his hotel, &quot;Where can I find some shoefactories?&quot;* And then there's the story about a Taiwanese business trip Knight and a colleague named Gorman made. At a toast-filled banquet, Knight, an old Asia hand, matched his hosts drink for drink. Gorman gave up and tossed his drinks under the table, where they splattered on Knight's pant leg. When the totally blotto Knight realized what Gorman had done, he knocked him down a flight of stairs.

"Imagine the following live broadcast during the Olympic Games this month: The Spanish police interrupt a basketball game and ask American athletes to strip. The officers then confiscate any shirts or shorts carryingNikeInc.'s logo.Although such a scene is a worst-case scenario, it could happen as a result of a dispute over trademark rights between the Beaverton, Ore., maker of athletic wear and Juan Amigo, a lawyer and associate ofNike'sformer distributor in Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike,sponsor of American Olympic teams, had hoped for wide advertising exposure during the Games. But that hope has been dashed by a Spanish court ruling that bans the company from marketing its sports clothing during the Olympics. An appeal of the ruling, which does not forbidNiketo market its logo on shoes, is unlikely to be taken up in time for the July 25 start of the Games.&nbsp;'Tremendous Economic Damage'&quot;It's unfair that the court is supporting someone who is taking advantage of someone else's success and who is causing tremendous economic damage,&quot; complained Cesar Garcelan, marketing director of AmericanNike,the company's current distributor in Spain, who estimatesNike'sapparel sales in Spain at more than 2 billion pesetas, or $20 million, a year.The company must now sell its clothing line at souvenir stands in Barcelona without the logo. Lawyers forNikeestimate that at the Olympic stand, those lost apparel sales were expected to represent about 10 percent of total sales. Sports bags account for perhaps another 10 percent, with shoes, whichNikeis allowed to market, representing the bulk of the sales.Richard K. Donahue,Nike'spresident and chief operating officer, was quoted in the Spanish business paper Expansion as saying that the company's trademark rights have been &quot;trampled&quot; in Spain.&nbsp;No Negotiation 'With Pirates'A United States Embassy official said that while the Embassy was supporting the American company, trademark battles often occurred in Spain and companies usually agreed to settlements in which they paid to gain control of their names. Adidas A.G. had a similar case and wound up paying.But oneNikeexecutive said, &quot;Our company's policy is not to negotiate with pirates.&quot;The formerNikedistributor and Mr. Amigo are now marketing their own identical range ofNikesportswear. Various people involved in the case contend that Mr. Amigo has asked for amounts varying from an early offer of $8 million to $10 million to settle the wrangle.Mr. Amigo and the lawyers who are handling his case were unavailable for comment.The nameNikewas first registered in Spain in 1932 by a Catalonian sock knitter and included a picture of a statue of an armless Greek goddess that stands at one of the stairway entrances to the Louvre in Paris titled, &quot;The Victory of Samotrace.&quot; The word &quot;NIKE&quot; is written at the pedestal in this 1932 registration.Mr. Amigo bought the rights to this trademark, which had never been used, in 1982. TheNikecompany in Oregon was granted trademark registration for shoes in 1983 and for sports clothes several years later.Trouble started when the American company decided to change distributors in 1989 when its contract expired. Mr. Amigo, a friend and associate of the former distributor, according to SpanishNikesources, then sought to register as a trademark a practically identical version of the United States logo, as well as some 200 versions of names using the word &quot;Nike.&quot;Spain's trademark registrar denied the application. Mr. Amigo then filed for an injunction banning the marketing ofNikeapparel in Spain on the ground that the two logos, the 1932 Greek goddessNikeand the American trademark, were &quot;confusing for clients.&quot; A lower court ruled in favor of the injunction in March 1991.Nikeappealed to Spain's Constitutional Court, the highest court. In April 1991, the court accepted the proceeding, but a definitive ruling is not expected for two to three years, well after the summer games.Because the Constitutional Court normally rejects about 90 percent of all appeals,Nikeapplied to post bond as a precaution that would allow the company to market its logo until a final ruling was made. It lost this second proceeding July 3 and has appealed in a last-ditch effort that is unlikely to beat the Olympic deadline.&quot;It is absolutely incredible that this man, Mr. Juan Amigo, can affectNike'sexposure all over the world by preventingNikefrom dressing the U.S. team,&quot; Mr. Garcelan complained.GRAPHIC:Photo: A dispute over trademark rights is dashingNike'splans to market its sports clothing at the Barcelona Olympics.

"&nbsp;IF, LIKENike, your range of sports apparel is named after the Greek goddess of victory, it may be embarrassing when it is worn by losers rather than winners.If, likeNike, you had plastered the images of these losers on billboards across the world in expectation of them being winners, it may be acutely, excruciatingly embarrassing. And if, likeNike, you had paid millions of dollars to these losers for the privilege, you might be wondering about the wisdom of your Olympic investment.&nbsp;BILLBOARD 1: &quot;You have just passed Michael Johnson. More than most athletes will do this summer.&quot;Well, &quot;most athletes&quot; - the badminton players, for instance - were not competing against Johnson. But even within his chosen event, the 200m sprint, at least five runners proved they could pass theNike-emblazoned Johnson - he came sixth of eight in his semi-final, failing even to qualify for the final.BUBKA: brought to earthALLSPORTBILLBOARD 2: &quot;Spanish air traffic control has been warned.&quot;They needn't have been. Sergey Bubka, the best pole vaulter in history, the long-serving,Nike-wearing world record holder (6.11m) and world champion, failed even to clear his opening height in the pole vault final. The Ukrainian made two attempts at 5.70m, then had a foolhardy, equally unsuccessful stab at 5.75m.BILLBOARD 3: &quot;Ever heard the Algerian national anthem? You will.&quot;Oh no, you won't. At least, not as a result of the performance ofNike-toting Nourredine Morceli. He came a modest seventh in the 1500m final.OtherNike-brandishing flops:- Kenyan runner Richard Chelimo had his 10,000m gold medal taken away from him.

Negotiations between the company and the civil rights group subsequently broke down.&quot;I have no idea what's going on there,&quot; said Dolan.  &quot;They have not announced what they're going to do.&quot;What Operation PUSH didn't do is return phone calls, repeatedly, fromMarketing News.  However PUSH operators have stopped saying, &quot;Say no toNike,&quot; when they answer calls.&quot;I don't think we understand completely what their motivation is,&quot; Dolan added, although she said that Reebok,Nike'sstrongest competitor, was in some sort of complicity with PUSH, as evidenced by a series of meetings between them and a Reebok ad in a PUSH publication.Reebok has denied this charge.At the heart of the dispute is PUSH's claim that some 30% ofNike'ssales come from the black community.  In line with that, PUSH saysNike'sreinvestment in the black community is woefully out of line.Nikeresponds that its sales are more in the neighborhood of 15% to blacks, that more than 15% of its hirings last year were minority group members, and some 7% of its employees are black.  The firm also boasts a line of famous athletic endorsers, including basketball's Michael Jordan.&quot;They know how hard we've worked&quot; toward equal opportunity, Dolan said.  &quot;We are the largest minority employer in Oregon.&quot;&quot;Nikealready is an equal opportunity company,&quot; concurred securities analyst Alice Ruth of San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, who follows the industry.  &quot;[PUSH is] barking up the wrong tree.&quot;Ruth went so far as to say that, at the outset of the boycott call,Nikeactually may have received a sales boost.&quot;I heard about kids going into stores and deliberately asking forNikes,&quot; she said.  &quot;Initially, [the boycott] may have had some pro-Nikereaction.  Their sales may be impacted by the economy, not by Operation PUSH.&quot;Ethnic experts thatMarketing Newstalked to lined up withNike.&quot;I don't necessarily like someone coming up to me and telling me how to invest my money,&quot; said Nathan Pope, principal of NPC &amp; Associates in Landover, Md., the state's largest black-owned ad agency.  His only caution, though, was thatNikemanagement, &quot;as sound and good businessmen, should know where their dollars are coming from.&quot;&quot;In many instances, there's an over-reaction,&quot; said Jerome Williams, marketing professor at Penn State in University Park, Pa.  &quot;I buy a lot ofNikeproducts.  I do a lot of running.  I think [Nikedoes] a good job.  But what are the responsibilities that go along with that transaction?&quot;However, human resources consultant John Work, of the New York firm by the same name, said, &quot;I don't like those kinds of marketing efforts . . . that black people are only worthy of athletic activity and not intellectual activity.  It says, Get these shoes and you can be like Michael Jordan.' It would seem to me that some of these basketball shoes are fast becoming ethnic products.&quot;Meanwhile,Nikekeeps rolling, recession and boycott notwithstanding.&quot;This idea we should negotiate something is questionable,&quot; said Dolan.  &quot;Negotiate what?  We have never disagreed with Operation PUSH on basic goals of equal opportunity and affirmative action.  We disagree with them on how to go about making these changes.&quot;&quot;[PUSH is] mandating equal opportunity,&quot; Montgomery's Ruth stated, pointing out what she sees as a fault in PUSH's stance and adding, &quot;Nikehas integrity.&quot;",0.0900673400673,0.465286195286,699 words,PUSH fails in boycott ofNikeshoes,1991-01-21 00:00:00,409 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Marketing News TM
"After seven years, Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to their first NBA championship - and no one is happier than Mars Blackmon, the basketball-crazy fan of Spike Lee'sNikecommercials.Nike'slatest humorous, celebrity-packed pitch, which debuts tonight during baseball's All-Star Game, has Mars at the NBA finals at Chicago Stadium, asking his perennial question, ''Is it the shoes?'' In the ad's kicker, A.C. Green of the defeated Los Angeles Lakers, grimly concedes, ''It had to be the shoes.'' Another version shows actress Dyan Cannon, one of the Lakers' famous fans, woefully agreeing.&nbsp;Nikebought four minutes of ad time during the All-Star game to kick off a $ 35 million ''Air'' campaign that features its biggest stars: basketball stars Jordan, David Robinson and Charles Barkley, tennis star Andre Agassi, and multi-sport star Bo Jackson.The athletes all have appeared in their own series of ads, but ''We wanted to have a link,'' says Tom Clark,Nike'smarketing director. ''It's not a real heavy-handed link. ... It says, these are the best shoes by the best athletes.''The series, by agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy, includes the return of Bo Jackson in his firstNikead since the hip injury that put his athletic career on hold and, as a result, raised questions about his endorsement career.''Everybody knows what Bo's status is,'' Clark says. ''You could do an ad not addressing it, but by addressing it you connect more with the sports fan, who wants to know what's going on with Bo.''Other Air series ads, like the Jordan spots, provide a one-two celebrity punch. In an ad to run during the U.S. Open, a TV screen shows Agassi hitting the ball with such force that the TV rockets across the room. One vicious swat jars the TV's channel to a flash of Julia Child's cooking show, with the chef holding up an artichoke.

"Add rehabilitation to the long list of skills thatNikeInc. boasts Bo knows.In new television commercials that begin next Tuesday, during CBS's telecast of the baseball All-Star Game, the nation's leading athletic shoe marketer will present the third annual installment in its &quot;Bo knows&quot; advertising series that has become as popular with ad-award committees as it is with sneaker-buying consumers.&nbsp;The story line for the new spots, called the &quot;Bo Show,&quot; centers on the football injury suffered by Mr. Jackson that forced his release by the Kansas City Royals baseball team. That is yet another unexpected move by Wieden &amp; Kennedy,Nike'siconoclastic ad agency in Portland, Ore., since many in the ad community predicted that Mr. Jackson's injury would end hisNikepitchman chores.&quot;There's an opportunity in everything,&quot; Scott Bedbury,Nike'sadvertising director, said yesterday. &quot;If anybody can make a comeback, it's Bo.&quot; The first &quot;Bo knows&quot; spot, in 1989, focused on Mr. Jackson's purported proficiency on guitar, while last year's boasted of his abilities in unexpected sports like auto racing.The first of the new spots shows Mr. Jackson attempting a new career as a song-and-dance man, only to quit in mid-warble. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he tells a bevy of chorines dressed in football and baseball costumes who seem to be spoofing Ray Charles's Diet Pepsi &quot;Uh-huh&quot; campaign.Mr. Jackson literally walks out of the commercial, by climbing out of a television set and into a family's living room, on his way to rehab. As he lifts weights and swims, attempting to get back in shape to join his new baseball team, the Chicago White Sox, he is interrupted by the chorines. When he refuses to rejoin them, the song-and-dance resumes with the boxer George Foreman -- another athlete on the comeback trail -- in Mr. Jackson's place.Nikeplans other &quot;Bo show&quot; spots later this summer, one featuring Wayne Gretzy of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and another featuring baseball and football players: Jerry Rice (San Francisco 49ers), Darryl Strawberry (Los Angeles Dodgers), Randall Cunningham (Philadephia Eagles) and Eric Davis (Cincinnati Reds).Also during the All-Star Game,Nikeplans to show new spots with the tennis star Andre Agassi; David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association, and the film director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the ultimate fan of Michael Jordan of the N.B.A.'s Chicago Bulls.GRAPHIC:Photo: The first in a series of new &quot;Bo knows&quot; television commercials created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy forNikeathletic shoes has Bo Jackson trying out a new career as a song-and-dance man, surrounded by dancers wearing Chicago White Sox and L.A.

"Bo Jackson's commercials created the impression that &quot;Bo knows&quot; the ins and outs of almost everything, especially sports. Now that the versatile athlete has been sidelined by a hip injury, one thing Bo does not know for sure is how much it will hurt his lucrative endorsement career.Jackson had parlayed his prowess in professional baseball and football into a high-profile job as a spokesman forNikeathletic shoes, earning him at least $2 million a year. The popular &quot;Bo Knows&quot; commercials played off Jackson's talents as both a star running back for the Los Angeles Raiders and an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals. In the commercials, he seemed the perfect pitchman for the company's cross-training shoes, which are cloth and leather sneakers designed for more than one sport.&nbsp;Jackson's ads, in large part, helpedNikeInc. to overtake Reebok International as the leader in the athletic shoe industry.&nbsp;Led to Other EndorsementsHis fame in theNikecommercials, created by Weiden &amp; Kennedy, a Portland, Ore., agency, also helped win him jobs as a spokesman for A.T.&amp; T. and Pepsico's Mountain Dew drink, which used a &quot;Bo Knows&quot; theme as well.But on Monday, the Royals released Jackson because of a slow-healing injury to his left hip that he suffered while playing football in January. Doctors say they do not yet know whether complications from the injury will keep him from playing for any team the rest of the year, or permanently.Sports marketing consultants said his attractiveness to some advertisers could be severely damaged, if not destroyed, if he is never able to play again. &quot;It certainly does not make sense for sporting goods companies to use an injured sports celebrity,&quot; said David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, a consulting service for ad agencies seeking sports celebrity endorsements. &quot;The calls may simply stop coming in.&quot;For the moment,Nikeis standing by Jackson. Liz Dolan, a company spokeswoman, said his injury, though serious, would probably not have a long-term effect on his relationship withNike,should he recover. &quot;This is unfortunate,&quot; she said, &quot;but we'll wait for him to come back.&quot;WhileNike'sreluctance to abandon Jackson is not surprising, the company does not have to rely on him alone.Nikehas a stable of celebrities, including Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association and John McEnroe, the tennis star. In addition, Ms. Dolan said,Nikeis always looking for young athletes on the verge of stardom.Nikestock fell as much as $3.75 yesterday before closing at $45.75, down $1.75, but the decline may have had little to do with the company's advertising prospects.Nikesaid analysts had lowered their estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings. The shares had fallen $2.50 each on Monday.Ms. Dolan saidNikehad just started work on its 1991 ad campaign, which will begin in July. She said that although no decision had been made, it was possible Jackson might be used in a humorous &quot;Bo Knows Rehab&quot; strategy for the cross-training shoes.Even if he had not been injured, Jackson would have been less prominent in the coming campaign,Nikesaid. Ms. Dolan saidNikeplanned to emphasize its basketball and outdoor cross-training shoes in the campaign and would use other sports celebrities. The company's previous campaign had concentrated on its sports cross-training shoes and had prominently featured Jackson.If Jackson does recover, but can play only one sport, probably baseball, consultants said he would still be able to do commercials. But his appeal would be limited, they said.&quot;Bo's advantage came from playing in two sports and appearing in sports stories most of the year,&quot; said Marty Blackman, a partner at Blackman &amp; Raber, a sports marketing and promotions consulting firm. &quot;With a lot of the glitter gone, his fees would certainly be reduced.&quot;Consultants said his endorsement fees, which by some estimates total about $5 million a year, could be cut by more than half if he is limited to just one sport.Some consultants said Jackson might have a hard time rounding up endorsements if he is never able to play any sport again. That would be because his career has been short; he has played professional football and baseball in the same year for four years.&quot;He didn't play long enough to become an established sports personality,&quot; Mr. Blackman said. &quot;You have to become a champion like Joe Namath to have cachet once your sports career is over.&quot;But even as a retired athlete, Jackson might be attractive to some advertisers who want to reach children. Lloyd Kolmer, the president of Lloyd Kolmer Enterprises, another consulting firm that helps match celebrities with advertisers, said Jackson was likely to continue to appeal to young people.&quot;It's a hero's story,&quot; Mr. Kolmer said. &quot;Children look up to him, not just because of sports, but because of his anti-drug and stay-in-school commercials.&quot;GRAPHIC:Photo: Bo Jackson's hip injury threatens his double career in athletics, but it is unclear how seriously it will affect his lucrative product endorsements.

This is true: 12-year-old boys, several wearingNikesof their own, were measuring their feet against their sports heros' shoes last week - Frank Bruno size 12, Ian Rush a dainty 71 2 - and guessing their high street prices. ''The public never pass comment on the level of branding. I think they would complain if it were unacceptable,'' said Caroline Nolan, the museum's public relations officer. This could be because the public thinks museum exhibitions are independent creations.The general visitor would be hard put to gather that ''Running on Air'' isNike'sshow rather than the Science Museum's, when hoardings express the museum's gratitude to the company for its support rather than vice-versa. ButNikeis quite clear that it sees the exhibition as scientific endorsement of its brand image as more than a fashion shoe. ''It positions us as a serious brand,'' saidNike'smarketing services manager, Simon Taylor. ''We tried to get the exhibition up and running the day the new shoe hit the stores and we manned the stand for the first few weeks''. He could have been talking about a stand at a trade fair.''When an art gallery shows an exhibition of a living artist, that is a kind of endorsement and it has an effect on market values of the work,'' said Helen Rees, director of the Design Museum. But relations with manufacturing industry pose particular problems for museums of applied arts and sciences - relying on manufacturers as they must for contributions to their collections and up-to-date information from the front line. ''Make it an exhibition of sports shoes and people hop up and down,'' said Neil Cossons, the Science Museum's director. ''But was the museum endorsing Rolls-Royce jet engines in a previous exhibition? That was a product-related exhibition by a single manufacturer and I find it curious that people draw a distinction.'' Perhaps the distinction is that children are not in the market for jet engines. If there are controls against product endorsement by children's television, why not by national museums?If museums bring in exhibitions designed by outside - and interested - parties, perhaps they should make a clearer distinction between ''museum space'' and ''private space''. It is an option the V &amp; A will consider next year when new display areas become available at the end of their ''Japan in Perspective'' exhibition. ''If we have a major exhibition sponsor manufacturing products that are relevant to our collections, we could show additional material - perhaps from their archives - making it quite clear that it is not part of the exhibition itself,'' said Sally Mason, the V &amp; A development director.Those who argue that sponsors may try to assert control over an exhibition are probably mistaken. Patrick Greene, director of the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, where British Nuclear Fuels gave pounds 73,000 to a new energy gallery, stressed that it was not until the last minute that BNFL asked for details of what would be on display. In the event, it disagreed with some of the contents - such as a picture of a bovine Chernobyl victim that came from a Soviet newsagency. The cow stayed: ''We stressed from the start that it was the museum's exhibition. BNFL would not have dreamt of interfering,'' said Dr Greene.The greater danger could be self-censorship with a museum inclined to tone down aspects of an exhibition that might upset a sponsor. ''Self-censorship is definitely a danger and any museum needs to be aware of it, but another danger is under-valuing what a museum has to offer,'' Dr Greene said.Surely one of a museum's most valuable assets is its reputation for academic integrity untainted by commerce - the reputation that makes business want to associate with museums in the first place. Perhaps the Science Museum should ask itself whether it is selling itself cheap to the shoe industry.'Running on Air' is on until 10 May.",0.165427860538,0.426026334776,978 words,HowNikegot a run for no money at the Science Museum; Does commerce taint academic integrity?

"&nbsp;WOULDN'T want to rain on the Olympic flame or anything, but here's some news about running shoes that doesn't exactly square withNike'ssensitive-new-age image.A story in the August issue of Harper's Magazine takes a look at the paycheque of an Indonesian woman named Sadisah. She works in an independent factory that makes shoes forNike.Sadisah works six days a week, ten and a half hours a day, for the equivalent of $ 37.46 US a month, or about 14 cents an hour. That's less than the Indonesian government's figure for &quot;minimum physical need.&quot;&nbsp;Her wage lets her rent a shanty with no electricity or running water.A pair ofNikesworth 80 bucks US costs about 12 cents in labor.Michael Jordan reportedly gets $ 20 million to endorseNike, which is the sponsor of the U.S. track and field team. It would take Sadisah 44,492 years to earn that.Reebok, the official footwear sponsor of the Olympics, and No. 2 in the world marketplace toNike, makes its shoes in a lot of the same countries as the Just Do It giant.On Thursday, Reebok's Bernadette Mansur wouldn't say what the labor adds up to for every pair of her company's shoes.&quot;All the wages in our factories are above minimum wage,&quot; said Mansur, who is vice-president of communications at Reebok's head office near Boston.She said every factory fills out questionnaires about wages, working conditions and time off, and they're inspected constantly.&quot;We would never get into a manufacturing circumstance where the values or the working conditions in that factory did not meet with Reebok values.&quot;*Jackhammers. Lawnmowers. Boom boxes. Ah, the sounds of summer.No. 1 crazy-making noise for Vancouver people, hands down, is construction. The city's health department gets twice as many calls complaining about building noise than any other kind of noise.Brian Johnston keeps track of this, because he's the health department's noise abatement officer. &quot;You gotta find out what's bothering the people.&quot;Next on the list is music, from houses, bars and cars.A big up-and-comer is lawn and garden equipment. Johnston gets a lot of calls about weedeaters, and even more about leafblowers.The health department just lowered the acceptable decibel levels of power equipment from 87 to 77. In January 1994, it'll drop to 74.Just so you know what the numbers mean, if you were 25 feet away from a gas lawnmower, you'd be getting about 87 decibels of noise. Between 70 and 80 decibels, you'd be hearing a fairly quiet vacuum cleaner or a hairdryer.Johnston says he's never had any really weird noise complaints - &quot;nothing from a UFO&quot; - but he does hear a lot about birds.He doesn't have any noise problems of his own.&quot;Noise hasn't bothered me really, but if you do sort of glom onto something, it can really become a problem,&quot; Johnston said. &quot;We see people becoming hysterical, and they have to go under a doctor's care.&quot;His examples of the kind of noise that makes people lose it? Big air conditioners and hot tub filters. &quot;It's continuous, and it can really drive a person batty.&quot;*And while we're talking noise . . . .We've finally nailed car alarms and boom cars. Hey, how about motorcycles?The high-pitched kind that sound like a chainsaw crossed with a killer mosquito. Or the low, growly ones whose sonic booms bounce back at us from every wall.Nothing ruins the peace of a summer day like some dork doing a James Dean shtik, burning rubber and busting eardrums as he (or she?) leaves the bike in low gear and revs up the motor.&quot;It's just one more frustration society heaps on us,&quot; says Bob Halabourda, acting inspector in the Vancouver police department's traffic section.Halabourda knows noise. Traffic cops get so much it, they get their hearing tested once a year.So, what can you do if you decide you've heard your last screaming engine?Not a whole lot. &quot;You can certainly complain, but an officer actually has to catch them committing the offense,&quot; says Halabourda.The police can haul over any driver making too much noise. Only problem is, bikers get pretty quiet when they spot a cop in the rearview.&quot;When I'm out for a walk at lunchtime, I see it all the time,&quot; says Halabourda. &quot;Funny, when I'm out riding, it doesn't seem to happen.&quot;",0.0851014109347,0.396274250441,717 words,Shoe manufacturers race for profits,1992-07-31 00:00:00,446 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)

"&nbsp;A stylish low-cut leather tennie with a hard plastic sole and metal spikes is the favored footwear of millionaires everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really. In Florida. During spring training.

The true value of a shoe lies in its comfort and purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The turf one is more of a shoe for shagging fly balls, jogging,&quot; said Ross. &quot;It's more cushioning, especially on the knees. Some outfielders will use the turf shoe in the outfield on turf and switch to&nbsp; the spikes when they bat.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal spikes are as much a part of baseball as tobacco stains on dugout floors and slow home-run trots. And while the molded plastic cleat is easier on the legs, the gripping and tracking abilities of spikes make them the most worn shoes in The Show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's just something they (players) have been using throughout their careers. They're comfortable with them,&quot; Ross said of metal spikes. &quot;Plus, if you slide into second or third, a guy is gonna think twice about blocking the bag if you're wearing metal spikes. It used to be a bigger deal in the old days, but there are certain players now who see you wearing plastic cleats and will block the base.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross says pitchers seem more particular about what they wear on their feet. While a position player might go through 20 pairs of shoes a season, about two pairs a year is tops for pitchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some guys will wear a pair of shoes until they're full of holes and ripping off their feet,&quot; Ross said, &quot;while others will get rid of a pair of shoes if they have a bad outing.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhhhh . . . the agony of da feet.JON WESTGRAPHIC:BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO, V.

"&nbsp;A flotilla of up to 40,000Nikeshoes has been slowly bobbing around the Pacific Ocean since the spring of 1990.  News that these sartorial requisites have met a watery fate may dismay the youth of the West. But it has brought joy to Oregon's beachcombers, who have been making a fortune reselling the shoes which, surprisingly, have survived their immersion with surprising resilience.  In another benevolent spinoff, the data provided by plotting the progress of theNikeflotsam has allowed oceanographers to test several complex theories about the detailed mechanics of Pacific currents.  &quot;It has been a real bonus to our work,&quot; said Dr. James Ingraham, of the National Marine Fisheries Service.  The story began on May 27, 1990, when a storm struck the freighter Hansa Carrier, which was en route to the United States from South Korea. The ship survived, but its shipment ofNikegym shoes was washed overboard. Not a sole was saved.  The incident was forgotten until November of that year, whenNikeshoes began appearing along the shores of Oregon. Large hiking boots, high-tops and other styles began to bob landward, at first in ones and twos, then in scores, eventually in the thousands. To the incredulity of locals, the beaches were swamped with multicolored shoes.  Within weeks, this well-heeled landing army had created a thriving new local economy. Beachcombers held swap-meets at which they exchanged right and left shoes, to be then resold in pairs.&nbsp;&quot;I got my pair for $20,&quot; said Ingraham. &quot;That's about a quarter of the price I would have paid in a store. Admittedly, they had spent a year sloshing about the Pacific, but after I'd worn them a couple of times, they loosened up and are quite comfortable now.&quot; The fact that their shoes were still wearable after many months' battering by storms and water would suggest thatNikeproducts have weather-proof qualities that could well be marketed. However, this has not been seized upon.  &quot;We contactedNike,but they didn't want to know,&quot; said Ingraham. &quot;Maybe a beachcomber's recommendation is not quite the testimony thatNikewas seeking.&quot; Maybe not, but the longevity of the shoes has been a real boon for Ingraham who, with colleague Curtis Ebbesmeyer, began studying the shoes' oceanographic meanderings. They used the data to produce a long paper for Transactions of the American Geophysical Union, a journal.  They report that many of the shoes appeared farther south than would normally have been expected for flotsam borne by the tropical Pacific currents that head north to Alaska.  Now, as the currents have swept back out to sea from Oregon, the shoes have been heading south and east, and already some have appeared on the shores of Hawaii.  &quot;The next stop is Japan,&quot; added Ingraham. &quot;After that, they will start on their second circle of the Pacific Ocean.&quot;",0.145219435737,0.318178086282,475 words,"SAGA OF THE 40,000 UNSINKABLE SHOES",1992-11-18 00:00:00,474 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
"The U.S. home-ownership rate has stabilized after falling in the early 1980s, the Census Bureau says. After rising steadily from 1940 to 1980, the home-ownership rate dropped from 65.6% of households in 1980 to 63.9% in 1989.  But a Census study, ''Housing in America: 1989-90,'' found that the decline came before 1985 and the ownership rate since has been stable. The Census Bureau attributed the drop in the 1980s to a larger number of young adults staying single. That's still true, but more older people now are marrying and are more likely to buy a home, stabilizing the ownership rate. The study also found that not all people who wanted to buy a home could. In 1988, 57% of all households couldn't afford a median-price home in the area where they lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;LTV BID WITHDRAWN: The French group Thomson-CSF withdrew its bid for the missile division of steelmaker LTV, Reuter reports, citing unnamed industry sources.

"TWO of the world's biggest suppliers of sports equipment -Nikeand Adidas - have warned the US Government that trade retaliation against China would seriously hurt their Hongkong operations.&nbsp;Nike, the world's largest producer of sports shoes, said if punitive tariffs were imposed the company would have to sharply raise prices or shut down its entire operation in China.Such action would undermine its regional headquarters in Hongkong, where there would be thousands of job losses, the company said.&nbsp;Nikehas urged the United States Trade Representative to target China's state- run shoe factories instead of those operated by private enterprises.&nbsp;Adidas, another industry giant, said all of its financing, purchases and shipping for Adidas merchandise manufactured in China was done through businesses in Hongkong, which would be hard hit by US trade retaliation.For example, a company such as Yue Yuen Industrial Ltd, the large sports shoe maker which listed on the Hongkong stock exchange in June, could see its business seriously wounded.As an original equipment manufacturer forNikeand Adidas, Yue Yuen employs 13,300 workers in its four mainland factories and nearly 200 supervisors, many from Hongkong, in operations that last year were 80 per cent devoted to the United States.But the powerful American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) has demanded that the US impose punitive tariffs on key Chinese exports to match dollar-for-dollar the losses suffered by the US from China's trade barriers.The groups were responding to a call by the US Government for public comment on which Chinese goods to single out for retaliation should Beijing fail to accept American demands to lift trade barriers against US products.Most of the 20 or so trade groups and companies that responded urged the Trade Representative's office to defuse the trade row by reaching a fair-trade agreement with Beijing instead of taking punitive action.They further urged that their products be left off the hit-list of Chinese goods should the talks fail and retaliation become necessary.US President George Bush has set an October 10 deadline for Beijing to sign a deal that would open up China's markets or face sharply higher tariffs against Chinese exports to the US.Deputy Trade Representative Michael Moskow increased the pressure last month with an ultimatum that unless Beijing accepted all US demands during market access talks beginning on August 19 in Beijing the US would publish a tentative hit-list of Chinese goods.In responding to the trade office's call for public comment, ATMI said the US should target Chinese goods that made up the key parts of China's export trade and those considered as high priority items by Beijing.The textile association added that the goods selected for punitive tariffs should be products China made exclusively for the US market - such as cotton towels, blankets and women's sweaters - so that China could not side-step punishment by exporting these products to other markets.&quot;Many of our member companies have long been victims of the unfair and illegal trade practices routinely carried out by China,&quot; the ATMI said.Crampton and Knowles, a top US dye company, accused China of widespread unfair trade by using trade barriers, employing prison labour and ignoring copyright.It urged the US to target goods that hurt China's economy most, including garments, footwear and toys.But the Hongkong General Chamber of Commerce warned that any damage to China's economy would affect Hongkong's economy.&quot;To make Hongkong an innocent victim is clearly a major injustice. There can be no winners in this,&quot; the chamber said.The Hongkong Toys Council warned the Trade Representative that retaliation against China would &quot;critically threaten&quot; the territory's toy manufacturers because 95 per cent of China's toy exports to the US were in fact produced by Hongkong firms on the mainland.The Federation of Hongkong Industries urged US officials to exclude from the hit-list &quot;those items which in your opinion might damage Hongkong industry if retaliation is necessary&quot;.The Hongkong Watch Manufacturers Association and the Hongkong Electronics Association also pleaded against retaliation, warning that such action could result in hundreds of thousands of job losses.",-0.00683395580454,0.40859632742,730 words,"Nike,Adidas fear tariffs' effect on HK;Top shoemakers warn US",1992-08-05 00:00:00,491 of 998 DOCUMENTS,South China Morning Post (Hong Kong)

"IN a sport dominated by money, John McEnroe and Andre Agassi will do an unusual thing at the National Tennis Centre today _ play an exhibition match for nothing. The reason is to promote their main sponsor,Nike, and announce its success in the Australian marketplace.&nbsp;Later this year,Nikeis expected to take over the mantle of market leader in the sports footwear industry from Reebok. The air sole is about to deflate the pump-action shoe.In an industry conservatively valued at $500million a year, that is a big deal, andNikeis not going to let us forget it.Today's exhibition tennis match is the first in a series ofNikepromotions. Next in line will be its basketball wares, which may entail an Australian visit next year by the biggest superstar in the game _ Michael Jordan.The company is among the top 10 television advertisers in the country, rivalling such traditional big spenders as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. Its formula has entailed using United States ads featuring Jordan, fellow basketballer Charles Barkley, Ukrainian pole vaulter Sergei Bubka and its &quot;Just do it&quot; jingle.A survey of viewers' ad recognition during the Barcelona Olympics putNike'sadvertisements near the top.The managing director ofNikeAustralia, Mr Tony Peddie, said the growth of theNikesports shoe in Australia followed the manufacturer's US success. &quot;Our boom is product-created by theNikeformula, of being able globally to franchise athletes to products, like Michael Jordan,&quot; he said.One of his competitors, Mr Paul Moore, group director of sporting goods at Pacific Dunlop, which has the licence to sell Adidas sports shoes in Australia, agreed, saying thatNikeis flavor of the month.&quot;The sporting goods market in Australia is a fad market. You are very hot for a while, then something else comes up and knocks you off,&quot; he said.&quot;The business is driven from American trends and what youth demands.Kids aged 14 to 18 are controlling the market.&quot; Demand is also shaped by changes in technology. Reebok generated huge sales through the pump-action technology in the tongue of its runners.In 1979,Nikefirst developed its air sole. Now, through its AirJordan brand, it has matched it with Reebok in Australia. Adidas has tried to develop its own image through its torsion sole, also designed to reduce stress on the foot.Analysts putNike'sshare of the sports footwear market at 27 per cent, slightly below Reebok but rising. Next in line is Adidas (the dominant player of the early 1980s) with about 16 per cent of the market, followed by Puma (about 10 per cent) and the rest.Mr Peddie saidNikeaimed for the same success locally that it had in the US, where it has 33 per cent of the market. It had given itself 18 months to achieve that kind of dominance.Today's challenge between McEnroe and Agassi is one of several exhibitions every year for which the players are contracted. Mr Peddie said: &quot;This promotion is all about showing the flag forNike. It is the first big shot in our sports marketing efforts and clearly this sort of thing is going to happen in the future. In the future we need to do something with basketball, which is such a growing sport.&quot;",0.102976190476,0.305952380952,527 words,Tennis greats with a spring in their instep,1992-10-04 00:00:00,499 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)"

"For a company that says it's selling ''self- empowerment,''Niketakes a lot of flak.The harshest criticism:Nikeisn't just latching onto sports, it's meddling in them.Take CBS' broadcast of the National League playoffs, when announcer Sean McDonough suggestedNikeendorser Deion Sanders played for baseball's Atlanta Braves and football's Atlanta Falcons because he let a reported $ 1 millionNikebonus for doing so ''take precedence'' over team allegiance.Broadcast partner Tim McCarver's curt response: ''It shouldn't.''&nbsp;Then there's the flap thatNikechairman and founder Phil Knight says prompted ''more negative calls and letters than anything else'' - whether sixNikeDream Teamers would wear Reebok-sponsored team outfits as they accepted their basketball gold medals at the Barcelona Olympics.In his Japanese-style office inNike'sJohn McEnroe Building, Knight, 53, has an answer for each charge. He says the company had ''no influence'' over Sanders' two-way play and that Sanders tookNike'sweekend shuttle ''because it had never been done before.''And whileNike'sMichael Jordan settled on draping a U.S. flag over the Reebok logo at Barcelona, Knight bristles that the media reduced the issue to ''a sound bite'' of an athlete picking ''his company over his country.''A company that last year spent $ 223 million on advertising, according to Advertising Age, doesn't welcome such publicity. Still, Knight says Jordan was upset, ''and I'd be, too.''Upset, that is, because none of the Dream Teamers ''did it for the money'' and because Jordan was presented with the Reebok sponsorship as a done deal. .And that's in violation of a basicNikepremise: The athlete is No. 1 - at least compared to everybody else in the sports world.That might be an unsettling concept to pro teams building fan loyalty meant to withstand lineup shuffles. Or to pro leagues, looking to move merchandise lines and TV rights as players come and go. Or to TV networks, trying to win ratings points with riveting replays, regardless of who's in focus.The friction causes brush fires, such as the dispute about Jordan's successful request that the National Basketball Association stop selling official league merchandise bearing his likeness - gear that arguably competes withNike'sJordan lines, which include $ 23 Air Jordan infant crib booties.''The NBA took those rights without actually having them,'' says Knight. ''Some of the players have said stop.''The primacy of the athlete - and the corollary thatNikehelps consumers find the athlete inside themselves - is as old as the company, whose marketing strategy began with putting shoes on serious runners' feet.Nike'sheadquarters, for instance, is a secular temple to athletes, complete with bust likenesses and encased relics of their exploits.Consider an area devoted to Steve Prefontaine, an Oregon runner killed in a 1975 car accident, displaying a menacing 1974 letter from track's governing body. Prefontaine, after competing in the 1972 Olympics, had the audacity to accept $ 5,000 from an embryonicNikefor basic expenses.The display case notes track officials' response to Prefontaine sporting aNikelogo: ''You can't do that. There are codes. There are subcodes.''Sometimes,Nikewelcomes publicity that pits it against the powers-that- be, such as when the NBA banned the original Air Jordan shoe for being too colorful.But asNikegrew, the criticism has a new edge: that nobody is rooting for Goliath.After slipping to archrival Reebok during the aerobics boom in the 1980s,Nike'srevenues rose from $ 877 million in 1987 to $ 3.4 billion in fiscal 1992.Nike'swomen's category is up from 12% of overall sales two years ago to 20% of today's overall revenues.Nikehopes expanding international sales, now $ 1.2 billion, will grow to 50% of total sales by 1996, when the company projects annual sales will reach $ 6 billion.AndNiketook care of its stockholders: Forbes magazine estimates Knight's personal wealth at $ 1.9 billion, about the same as Ted Turner, cable TV magnate and owner of sports teams.So it might have been only a matter of time untilNike'srole in sports was questioned, albeit not always convincingly. At the Barcelona Olympics, Mizuno endorser Carl Lewis suggested U.S. coach Mel Rosen might have let athletes' ties toNikefactor into his relay selections.The accusation wasn't given much credibility in the track world. And Steve Miller, a longtime track coach and Kansas State athletic director before becomingNike'ssports marketing director, dismisses the charge with more than a discourse on ethics: ''Could I - or anybody else here - keep our job if we did something like that? Absolutely not.''Miller also says the feesNikepays to shod major college basketball teams are guided by market forces. He says fees from about 25% of those deals go directly to colleges rather than to coaches, and that it's fine withNikeif that percentage increases, as long asNikegets the feet. Says Miller: ''How universities run their business is their call.''Nike'smove into providing a range of services for its athletes, the latest being the Charlotte Hornets' Alonzo Mourning, has prompted speculationNikewas ready to flex its muscle in athlete management or even buy out the market leader, International Management Group.Knight adamantly denies the IMG rumor, sayingNike''isn't anxious to get into being a full-blown athlete management company.'' He suggestsNike'sconcern with an athlete's overall business is a logical extension of concern for the credibilityNikewants an endorser to project.Bottom line: ''If sports lose their credibility,'' says Knight, ''so do we.''But don't expectNiketo back off when sports officials call the company an interloper. SaysNikead director Scott Bedbury: ''DoesNikehave a patent on the spirit of athletics? No. But neither does anybody else.''IsNiketoo powerful?Some critics sayNike'sbillion-dollar marketing muscle and flock of star endorsers are having an effect on what happens on the playing field.Some ofNike'sstar endorsersMichael JordanJim CourierAndre AgassiCharles BarkleyDavid RobinsonBo JacksonScottie PippenDeion SandersSergei Bubka&nbsp;NikeInc. revenues (in billions)'92 $ 3.4GRAPHIC:GRAPHIC, color, Sam Ward, USA TODAY, Source:NikeInc.

"UNLESS you've been hovering round the dark side of the moon lately, you'll be aware that the Barcelona Olympics are now a matter only of weeks away.&nbsp;None are more conscious of this than the folks at Channel Seven, which will be screening 21 hours a day of games to recoup through advertising revenues some of the reported $46 million the network poured into the screening rightsThat money, of course, doesn't pay for the herculean operation that Seven has undertaken to ensure Australian viewers aren't tempted away from gymnastics and archery by Wendt and Hinch.Seven has, more or less, built a medium-sized TV station in Barcelona which, of course, will all have to be pulled down less than three weeks after the opening ceremony on July 25.Once hacks, camera crews, technicians and so on are all assembled in the city, Seven's Barcelona staff will number more than 150, which represents a pretty colossal expense account.THE media loves a controversy story when it comes to the Olympics, and Addison has turned up a couple of them.First, try to imagine the Spanish police interrupting a basketball game and asking the American athletes to strip their gear off, then confiscating shirts and shorts bearing theNikelogo. Ridiculous?Not according to The New York Times, which reports that a trademark row in Spain has resulted in a judgement in favour of a Spanish lawyer, Juan Amigo, an associate ofNike'sformer distributor in Spain who now sells a pirate line ofNikeclothing.As sponsors of the US Olympic teams, the realNike, of course, has counted on huge advertising exposure at the games, but Snr Amigo's court win means thatNikemay not market its sports clothes - except shoes for some unexplained reason - during the Olympics. With no appeal possible before July 25, the NYT saysNikewill have to sell its clothing line at souvenir stands in Barcelona without the logo.Amigo's price to drop the ban is a cool $US10 million, about half ofNike'sannual sales in Spain.SECOND: The European Broadcasting Union, EBU, is facing huge fines, according to Reuter, for refusing to allow a private channel, Screensport, access to any Olympic coverage.The EBU is a grouping of the main national broadcasters in Europe(including France's Antenne 2 and the BBC), but it has stubbornly refused Screensport any footage rights because it wants to pass on pooled coverage of the games to its own channel, called Eurosport.The European Commission appears to have grown annoyed at the EBU's stance, and has threatened it with emergency rulings this week, with fines that could make the Olympic TV rights look paltry, if it does not comply.SHE won't be covering the Olympics, but SBS will this week cover her.In one of those table-turning exercises that TV producers, if not always the viewing public, love indulging in, Jana Wendt has been allowed out of the Nine Network for an evening to appear as the victim of a Face the Press interview, to be screened on SBS at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening.The programme will mark only the second time Jana has appeared as an interviewee outside the Nine Network since January 1988, says the SBS publicity blurb.Gosh.",0.0930618686869,0.402960858586,525 words,ADDISON,1992-07-14 00:00:00,515 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Australian Financial Review
"Probably by August 2000, at an Olympic Stadium constructed in someplace quiet, like Madison Avenue, a new Olympic era will be ushered in: no flags, no competing nations, only corporate sponsors. There will be teams fromNike, Reebok, Mizuno, from Umbro, Speedo, Converse, from adidas, Champion and Starter, from McDonald's, Wheaties and Pizza Hut. Michael Jordan and hisNikesagainst Shaquille O'Neal and his Reeboks in the gold medal basketball game. If the Games of Barcelona, which open Saturday, are any indication, we're closer to this insanity than you think.&nbsp;Just in case you haven't been obsessively following this summer's Sponsor Wars, let's recap: A Barcelona-based company named Cidesport, which claims it registered the nameNikein 1932, has won a decision in a Spanish court that upholds Cidesport's right to the trademark. Supposedly, this means all sponsored athletes are prohibited from wearing the nameNikeon their apparel here at the Summer Olympics. The Tribunal Constitutional didn't, however, tell us exactly how this ruling would be enforced. &quot;What are they going to have,Nikepolice strip Gwen Torrence before she runs the 100?&quot; a U.S. Olympic official asked Friday. &quot;Are they going to rip off Carl Lewis's pants because they have the wordNikeon them? They're blustering and assuring the world that's what will happen. But if they want a brouhaha like the Olympics has never seen, let them try to tell our athletes what they can and cannot wear.&quot;Yes, indeed, you would be better off driving an athlete's Porsche into the drink before you mess with his or her clothing contract. This is more than just this little two-bit, publicity-hungry Cidesport vs.Nike.Nikealso is embroiled in a set-to with its primary rival, Reebok. Each sport of each country determines its apparel sponsor, which is why the U.S. basketball team is wearing uniforms made by Champion, sporting the Champion logo, and why the U.S. track and field team is wearingNikeuniforms. But each National Olympic Committee makes its own apparel deal; in this case the USOC has made it mandatory that all athletes wear an outfit made by Henry Grethel (via JCPenney) in the Opening Ceremonies, and sweats by Reebok during the medal and closing ceremonies. So what you've got, for example, is decathlete Dave Johnson, a Reebok guy, having to compete all week in aNiketrack suit.If you don't think the Logo Wars are impassioned, consider that Michael Jordan would rather stand nude on the medal stand than wear that unspeakable &quot;other brand&quot; in which he would be photographed and seen by more than 1 billion people. Wearing the mandatory clothing is part of the code of conduct that each athlete signs before the Games. Still, Jordan told Sports Illustrated, &quot;There's no way in the world I'm wearing a suit made by Reebok.&quot;He reiterated that sentiment during a conversation in Monte Carlo last week. And a spokesman for the Dream Team said Friday, &quot;Michael still says there's no way he's wearing it. Something will have to be resolved.&quot;It's unimaginable that theNikeathletes, including Jordan, Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson and world record pole vaulter Sergei Bubka, would ever let Cidesport, or a Spanish court for that matter, intimidate them into putting tape over theNikelogo. But it's completely imaginable that they'd tape over the word Reebok during a medal ceremony, or wear aNikehat or some other attention-drawing piece of clothing that would pay homage to the company that pays each of them millions.Jordan, who isn't one to budge on such issues, may have to this time. It's not as if Reebok can go out and distribute posters with his likeness, wearing its apparel, after the Olympics. He (and the five other Dream Teamers signed withNike) already have been photographed ad nauseum wearing Champion, which is clearly a competitor. Jordan will spend much more time in a Champion uniform than he would in Reebok sweats.Nikegot the deal with The Athletics Congress and Reebok has to live, uneasily, with that. SoNikewill have to live with the fact that Reebok got the deal with the USOC.You'd hope that at some point the athletes would cherish the uniform to the point, that anything having USA and the Olympic rings would transcend the issue of who makes the garment. At some point, commercialism has to be put aside, even only for a few moments.Nikewon't void a deal with Jordan because he wears the USOC-issued warmups. Reebok won't revoke a deal with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Michael Chang, Zina Garrison or Coach Chuck Daly in the event each wears another sponsor's shirt for 10 minutes.That, of course, is probably the naive view, the opinion of a man who isn't paid millions to do anything exclusively. Even in the few cases in life when money isn't involved, extremist pride often is. When we see Fidel Castro wearing military fatigues with a swoosh on the chest and the words &quot;Just Do It&quot; underneath, we'll know the whole concept of sponsorship has gone completely over the edge.GRAPHIC:PHOTO, DREAM TEAM STAR MICHAEL JORDAN, ANIKECLIENT, VOWS HE'LL NOT BE SEEN IN A REEBOK OUTFIT FURING MEDAL CEREMONIES.

"&nbsp;PORTLAND, Ore. - The ad agency of Wieden and Kennedy, chief image crafter ofNikeshoes (''Just Do It'') and Subaru cars (''What to Drive''), is pushing the advertising envelope with its risky, intuitive campaigns and an unorthodox - to say the least - management style.  Two leading trade magazines, Advertising Age and Adweek, each have named Wieden and Kennedy agency of the year, citing the countercultural nature of the firm's work.  With current annual billings of $200 million, Wieden and Kennedy also has been in the running for two huge new accounts: MasterCard and Sega of America, which markets Genesis video games. Together, these represent about $115 million a year in new business.  To put the significance of this another way, an agency typically keeps 15 percent of its client's billings.  Yet Wieden and Kennedy staff members seem unfazed by all the attention.  They wear jackets inscribed with the reminder, ''Don't Act Big, No Sharp Stuff.'' Staff lists are alphabetized by first names.  Titles are left off business cards.  Nobody dresses up.  Beer flows from kegs on Friday afternoons.  And job applicants lucky enough to get interviews are asked such things as, ''Do you like to have fun?'' (Right answer: Yes). Or, ''Which kind of Milky Way is better - plain or dark chocolate?'' (Right answer: Let's go have a drink, then decide).  ''We don't have a personnel department,'' says Dan Wieden, one of the names on the door. ''What personnel manager in his right mind would hire these people?'' David Kennedy, the other founder, sometimes is mistaken for a janitor by the slew of new employees the agency has hired in the last year to cope with its startling growth.&nbsp;Little wonder - his work attire consists of denim pants, denim shirt, cowboy boots and a big ring of keys dangling from his belt.  Wieden, 47, says he didn't have much enthusiasm for advertising when he got into the business right out of the University of Oregon. He had wanted to be ''a playwright or a poet - something meaningful,'' he says.  Then, while working as a copywriter at a now-defunct Portland advertising office, he met Kennedy, who had moved his family of seven from Chicago to take a job as art director.  All of a sudden, Wieden says, advertising took on a whole new meaning. ''It was like realizing there was a higher form of the profession that could be very rewarding.'' The pair eventually worked up the nerve to start their own agency in 1982.  Their first account wasNike,whose billings at the time amounted to a measly $1 million a year.  There is a saying in adverti sing that great clients make great advertising.  There is no question, says Kennedy, 52, that the agency is the child ofNikeInc., the sports giant based in Beaverton, Ore.Niketook most of its advertising away from Wieden and Kennedy in 1983, then gave the whole thing back to the renegade ad shop in 1986.  ''Nikeallows us to be brave and has funded that bravery,'' Wieden says.  ''They ask us to jump off cliffs - and jump off with us.'' Indeed, asNikerevenues swelled to $3 billion a year - and its ad budget to more than $100 million - Wieden and Kennedy's work has grown in stature.  From the Bo (''Bo knows . . . '') Jackson self-parodies, to the teaming of Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan, to the technically brilliant ''Instant Karma'' spot,Nikehas allowed Wieden and Kennedy to push the envelope.  ''A lot of agencies follow linear paths guided almost exclusively by research,'' says Scott Bedbury,Nike'sdirector of advertising. ''Wieden and Kennedy places a very high priority on the visceral side of communication.  It's a philosophy we share with them.'' In other words, it's a right brain kind of thing.  TheNikespots tend to be risky, but even Wieden and Kennedy's competitors say they get the job done.  ''At the end of the day when everybody goes home, it's what's in the magazines and what's on television that counts,'' says Bob Kuperman, president and chief executive officer of Chiat-Day-Mojo, a bigger agency in Venice, Calif., with a long reputation for producing creative ad campaigns. It currently handles advertising for Reebok,Nike'schief rival, and wasNike'sagency from 1983 to 1986. ''Wieden and Kennedy has consistently delivered, '' Kuperman says.  Despite Wieden and Kennedy's much-heralded work forNike,the agency didn't move into advertising's major leagues until it picked up the $70 million-a-year Subaru of America account last year.  To work with Subaru, the agency opened an office in Philadelphia, just across the Delaware River from Subaru headquarters in Cherry Hill, N.J.  Some staff members saw it as the breakup of the Wieden and Kennedy family.  Insiders and outsiders alike wondered whether the rapidly growing agency would lose its edge and become (gasp) predictable.  So far, it hasn't. Wieden and Kennedy's work for Subaru - which, unlikeNike,is far from a market leader and has suffered from an identity crisis - has turned car advertising on its ear with a revolutionary campaign that mocks the 1980s ethos of automobile as status symbol.  Meanwhile, back in Portland, co-creative directors Dan Wieden and David Kennedy try to figure out how to get big without getting bad.",0.155272927073,0.519065068265,873 words,NIKE'SAD SHOP JUST DOES IT,1992-06-07 00:00:00,521 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)

"Shares of United Telecommunications Inc., owner of long-distance company Sprint, sank 1 1/8 to $ 23 5/8 Monday as investors worried that Sprint may lose or have to adjust a contract with the government.The General Accounting Office claims the federal government is paying AT&amp;T and Sprint $ 148 million more in the next two years than it should. It said Sprint charges too much. That could lead Congress to force Sprint to cut rates. AT&amp;T and Sprint share a $ 25 billion contract to provide the government with long-distance phone service.&nbsp;But analysts say investor concerns about Sprint losing the contract are exaggerated. A lot of the fuss, they say, has been caused by MCI, which doesn't have a piece of the contract and keeps telling the government it could do the job more cheaply than either AT&amp;T or Sprint.Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says Sprint already has cut long-distance rates several times to bring them in line with AT&amp;T's rates. Gross says investors are worried that Sprint could lose a portion of its contract in 1993 after the contract is rebid. But that's unlikely.

"&nbsp;The state of Missouri currently has a model for the non-graded primary school.AtNikeElementary in Catawissa, students who have previously been bound to a traditional kindergarten-through-third-grade program are now offered a 3- , 4- or 5-year program. This non-graded approach allows teachers to move children through a continuous curriculum, allowing the developmental differences.  The overall goal is to ensure that all children reach their academic potential.  Although the non-graded program has been compared to the one-room schoolhouse, marked differences exist. Age groups and grades are clearly identified, and preset graded curriculums are taught year to year in a rigid format.  As large numbers of students began to attend, school rooms were added to existing buildings, and the different grades were split apart. This more closely aligns the one-room concept to our traditional graded schools of today. Certainly much cross-age learning occurred. Younger pupils learned from listening to older classes, and older students having problems could listen as presentations were made to younger classes. Much peer tutoring was employed, both as a help for the teacher and because the children enjoyed working together.  Today's non-graded program seeks to define sets of learner objectives that allow for developmental difference s of children. Learning strategies and materials to accommodate the flexible time provisions of non-graded classrooms can be varied and diverse. What they have in common is an understanding of how to determine when the child is academically ready to move from level to level.&nbsp;In a non-graded primary school, there is no repeating of a grade because of academic failure. Instead of retention, students are taught at a pace that ensures academic success and growth. A child may take five years to complete the traditional K-3 program, but it occurs by progressing through the primary levels at a slower pace. Teachers do not have to subvert the system to fit the child's needs but can use flexible time provisions to move a child at any time that child has met the academic criteria for each level. A three-year program is also offered atNikeallowing a student to accelerate through the program with academic successes. The curriculum is flexible, expanding to challenge all children.  The developers ofNike'snon-graded primary - myself, Barb Betz and Jean Wills - have broadened the curriculum to meet student needs. They have embraced a variety of teaching strategies including cooperative learning, cross-age tutoring, extensive use of volunteers, continuous assessment and mastery learning to help each child achieve academic successes. We have not addressed or cured all the problems that face our educational system, but we believe we have taken a step in the right direction.  Karen M.

"&nbsp;THE legendary Carl Lewis has boosted his &pound;5 million-a-year earnings with a &pound;1 million payment to advertise Japanese shoe producers Mizuno at next week's Barcelona Olympics.His US colleague, decathlete Dan O'Brien, picked up another cool million from rival sport shoe manufacturers Reebok in a spectacular &pound;12 million television advertising campaign.German golden girl Katrin Krabbe was also paid a small fortune by market leadersNiketo sport their famous flash in Spain.At the other end of the scale, Britain's Linford Christie, the fastest man in Europe, has a &pound;60,000-a-year contract with Puma to show off their latest footwear at the Games.&nbsp;And gritty Scottish long-distance star, Liz McColgan, perhaps the best British gold medal prospect, has recently signed a &pound;20,000-a-year shoe deal with Asics.The payments are part of a &pound;1 billion bonanza on offer at Barcelona as the world's running shoe firms and corporate giants search for stars to help them out of recession.There is, however, an ironic difference between Christie and McColgan and their American rivals, not merely a financial one.The British stars will be on their blocks and raring to go in the events that made their names. The mega-stars on whom the shoe people pinned most of their hopes and their dollar bills will not.Lewis failed dismally in the US sprint trials and will not be defending his Olympic title in the race to find the fastest man on earth.Fellow trials' flop O'Brien and Krabbe - 'emotionally exhausted' after finally winning a long, bitter fight to clear herself of drug test fiddling charges - will be going to Barcelona only as spectators.In fact, the endorsement campaigns devised by the leading sport shoe companies, competing in a cut-throat battle for a world market valued at a staggering &pound;10 billion, are in utter disarray.To add to the general air of despondency, the final run-up to Barcelona has been littered with other big-name casualties, leaving embarrassed ad campaign directors in the industry in danger of entering the Marketing Hall of Shame.Other major household names in athletics who have fallen at the final hurdle, through injury, personal problems and enforced early retirement include Daley Thompson, Steve Cram, Peter Elliott, Roger Kingdom and Mary Decker-Slaney.As a result, a new air of caution has gripped major sports sponsors in Britain, marked by a flat refusal to invest in expensive network television marketing campaigns with any of our elite track and field athletes.The distinct lack of real big money interest is further highlighted by the fact that not one of the members of the Chafford 100 club, set up by former world javelin champion Fatima Whitbread to look after elite athletes' commercial aspirations, features among the top 10 earners in British sport.With personal sponsorship deals totalling just &pound;1.5 million over the past 18 months for 17 of Britain's current crop of 24 elite athletes, they have emerged as the poor relations.Even with handsome appearance fees, grand prix prize money, newspaper interviews, fashion fees and television appearances on programmes like A Question of Sport, none of our top Olympians is understood to have earned more than &pound;250,000 over the past year.In 1991 Peter Elliott was Britain's top athletics earner, making &pound;160,000 (including a &pound;20,000-per-year contract with Asics).Linford Christie's total earnings over the same period were reported to be over &pound;100,000, although since his world championships success he is believed to have more than doubled his money to take over top spot.Other leading British earners include: javelin star Steve Backley, &pound;150,000 (&pound;55,000 from Adidas); Liz McColgan, &pound;100,000; 400-metres Olympic medal hopeful Roger Black, &pound;90,000-plus (&pound;55,000 from Adidas); and Tom McKean, &pound;80,000-plus (&pound;20,000-per-year from New Ballance).According to Fatima Whitbread, most of these shoe deals have at least doubled in the cases of medallists from the world championships, with &pound;25,000 bonus clauses built in for major Olympic success.The insulting fact that Britain's current crop of Olympic hopefuls appear to have been labelled also-rans in the major advertising stakes will, no doubt, spur them on to greater heights in their quest for Barcelona gold.If further incentive is needed for them to fill the apparent mega-star void, they need only look back at the riches garnered by Britain's most famous athletic rivals, Coe and Ovett.Sebastian Coe, the only man ever to win Olympic gold twice at the blue-riband 1,500 metres distance, bought a &pound;1 million house in Twickenham with his earnings.Steve Ovett went on to enjoy his semi-retirement from a 16-bedroom mansion near Annan in Scotland.Had either been around today who knows what further fortunes would have lain in store?

"&nbsp;Jim Courier, the biggest bread-winner on the pro tennis tour this year, could &nbsp;be on his way to owning the whole bakery.Dade City's Courier, now ranked No. 2 after spending most of 1992 atop the &nbsp;pyramid, has signed a reported six-year, $ 27-million endorsement contract with &nbsp;NikeInc. that takes effect Oct. 1, when his current five-year endorsement &nbsp;deal with Diadora expires.Nikeofficials won't confirm the figures, but Diadora advertising manager &nbsp;Anne McIntosh said they are consistent with what has been floating around the &nbsp;industry.&nbsp;If correct, the contract dwarfs the $ 4.14-million in prize money Courier &nbsp;has earned during his five years on the pro tour (he's made a tour-leading &nbsp;$ 1.55-million so far this year). He would be elevated into the same Madison &nbsp;Avenue fraternity as Michael Jordan, Andre Agassi and Bo Jackson.&quot;We're delighted,&quot;&nbsp;said Dusty Kidd, public-relations manager forNike's&nbsp;&nbsp;tennis division. &quot;He has a certain style unlike any other player, and he's a &nbsp;supremely athletic guy and that fits in with what we like.&quot;Courier is in Minneapolis with the U.S. Davis Cup team, which faces Sweden &nbsp;in a semifinal match this weekend. He didn't return phone calls to his hotel &nbsp;room.It's a fat deal for an athlete who doesn't appear to have as marketable an &nbsp;image as Jordan, Jackson, Agassi and Deion Sanders, allNikeclients. But Kidd &nbsp;said the company was attracted to Courier by his on-court performance and his &nbsp;clean-cut, wholesome personality.&quot;He likes traditional American things: red cars, red guitars and he wears &nbsp;a cap. He's a real all-American guy,&quot;&nbsp;said Kidd, adding that athletes such as &nbsp;Jordan can bring in $ 200-million in sales each year.And you can expect to see him on your TV and in sports magazines in the &nbsp;months to come, Kidd said.Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., is putting together &nbsp;a sizable advertising campaign for Courier, Kidd said.Courier will beNike'slead promoter of a new line of apparel called &nbsp;Supreme Court, Kidd said. The line actually debuted last winter, butNike&nbsp;&nbsp;already has gotten some design input from Courier and plans to relaunch the &nbsp;new line designed around Courier's image.The tennis clothing and shoes will be dominated by the colors red, white &nbsp;and khaki and feature pinstripes. The shoe, available now in stores, is called &nbsp;Air Supreme Court, and comes in a low-top (suggested retail price $ 90) and &nbsp;three-quarters-top model ($ 95), which is what Courier will play in.&nbsp;",0.0702690166976,0.323459080602,419 words,Courier signs big pact withNike,1992-09-23 00:00:00,556 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Petersburg Times (Florida)

"&nbsp;This strange story began on May 27, 1990, when a storm struck the freighter &nbsp;Hansa Carrier as it crossed the Pacific from Korea to the United States. The &nbsp;freighter survived, but its shipment ofNikeshoes was washed overboard. Not a &nbsp;sole was saved.&nbsp;The incident was forgotten until that November, whenNikeshoes began &nbsp;appearing along the shores of Oregon.Large hiking boots, high-top athletic shoes and other styles began to bob &nbsp;landwards, at first in ones and twos, then in scores, eventually in the &nbsp;thousands. To the incredulity of locals, the beaches were swamped with shoes &nbsp;of many colors.Over the past two years, up to 40,000 shoes have washed ashore.Within weeks after the shoes started to wash up, a thriving new local &nbsp;economy was created. Beachcombers held swap-meets to exchange right and left &nbsp;shoes, then resold them in pairs.They've made a fortune selling the shoes, and buyers have been pleased with &nbsp;their bargains.&quot;I got my pair for $ 20,&quot;&nbsp;said James Ingraham. &quot;That's about a quarter of &nbsp;the price I would have paid in a store.&quot;Admittedly, they had spent a year sloshing about the Pacific, but after &nbsp;I'd worn them a couple of times they loosened up and are quite comfortable &nbsp;now.&quot;The fact that the shoes were still wearable after many months'&nbsp;battering by &nbsp;storms and water would suggestNikeproducts have a certain weather-proofing &nbsp;prowess, a quality that could well be marketed. It hasn't been.&quot;We contactedNike, but they didn't want to know,&quot;&nbsp;said Ingraham. &quot;Maybe &nbsp;a beachcomber's recommendation is not quite the testimony thatNikewas &nbsp;seeking.&quot;The longevity of the sports shoes has been useful in another way to &nbsp;Ingraham, who is an oceanographer with the National Marine Fisheries Service.Ingraham and colleague Curtis Ebbesmeyer began studying the shoes'&nbsp;&nbsp;oceanographic peregrinations. The data provided by plotting theNikearmada's &nbsp;progress has allowed them to test several complex theories about the detailed &nbsp;mechanics of Pacific currents.&quot;It has been a real bonus to our work,&quot;&nbsp;Ingraham said.With the data, Ingraham and Ebbesmeyer produced a lengthy paper for the &nbsp;journal Transactions of the American Geophysical Union. They report that many &nbsp;of the shoes appeared farther south than normally would have been expected for &nbsp;flotsam borne by the tropical Pacific currents that head north to Alaska.Now, as the currents have swept back out to sea from Oregon, the shoes have &nbsp;been heading south and east. Already some have appeared on the shores of &nbsp;Hawaii.&quot;The next stop is Japan,&quot;&nbsp;said Ingraham. &quot;After that, they will start on &nbsp;their second circle of the Pacific Ocean.&quot;&nbsp;",0.117087542088,0.32296376463,448 words,"Up to 40,000Nikeswash ashore in Ore.",1992-11-18 00:00:00,563 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Petersburg Times (Florida)
"Julie Lewis of Portland, Ore., has a masters degree in bio-nutritionand taught at a New England private college, which in no way explains howshe came up with the idea of manufacturing walking shoes from recycledgarbage. &quot;I just liked the idea of creating something practical fromrecycled material,&quot; said Lewis, whose creativity has resulted in other,less successful, inventions.&nbsp;Lewis's walking shoes are made from recycled polypropylene, paper bags,coffee filters, reclaimed tires, foam rubber and scrap metal. The idea forthe shoe came from conversations with tire recyclers andNikefounder BillBowerman. The invention of a machine that weaves recycled polypropylenemade it possible.

"IVAN KELIC is the strongest forward in the National Soccer League thi season and that's one of the reasons why he has become such a dangerous striker.That is the claim of Alan Davidson, who has seen Kelic's development in his three seasons at Melbourne Croatia.&quot;We've got rugged defenders like Andrew Marth and George Hannah but in 50-50 clashes at training Marth has bounced off while Kelic has held his ground,&quot; Davidson said.&nbsp;&quot;He's all brute strength now and that's made it hard for defenders to knock him off the ball.Kelic equalled an NSL record on Sunday becoming only the second player to score six goals in one game.His feat easily earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.As the weekly winner he collects a pair ofNikeAir runners worth $280.Kelic, however, believes his teammates deserve most of the credit.&quot;It was the easiest game I've ever played in - I just stood up front and put the ball in the net,&quot; he said.&quot;After I scored the third from a penalty, there was a real chance of becoming the league's top scorer and my teammates started playing to me.&quot; Kelic has been working on weights in the gym three times a week.&quot;I've felt much stronger and that too has helped in the confidence.&quot; he said.His goals this season have raised suggestions of a place in the Socceroo squad but Kelic is not getting carried away.&quot;The main priority is to help Melbourne Croatia make the grand final and win it. If I was to get a call-up from Eddie Thomson, it would be a bonus,&quot; he said.Kelic is the fourth player to win the award twice this season.

"While doctors from Tijuana to Bangor, Maine, continue their game of prognosis roulette, it might interest those speculating about Bo Jackson's financial future that the wallet is getting fatter. Still.&quot;No,Nikehasn't dropped him, and, yes, he's still alive and well,&quot; Suzanne McKee, Jackson's business manager, said Tuesday before the question was asked. &quot;He's going to Los Angeles Sunday to shoot a newNikecommercial. It's going to be with a comedian, but I can't discuss it beyond that.&quot;&nbsp;The script may be a secret but Jackson's endorsement status isn't.Nike, his major source of income, is designing another new campaign around him, despite the fact his future as an athlete is in doubt. (McKee did offer the obvious: that the commercial will deal with his rehabilitation from a hip injury.) There also are ongoing deals with Pepsi, &quot;BoMed&quot; sports medicine products (which is expanding distribution to Japan), Tiger Electronics games and Franklin Sports equipment.Jackson generally commands multi-year deals and least a half-million dollars annually per endorsement, according to Nova Langtree, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, though theNikedeal is well into seven figures.Langtree, who assesses the marketability of sports stars, said Jackson's status could dip a year from now if he can't make a comeback with the Chicago White Sox. But she added, &quot;As a spokesperson, he's gone so far beyond what is normal. And because ofNikeand how cutting-edge [its campaigns] are, there's going to be a second round of drama after the surgery. We might see a bionic man thing.&quot;McKee, who heads the newly formed &quot;Bo Jackson Enterprises&quot; in Mobile, said 1991 was Jackson's biggest year in terms of endorsement dollars despite his playing in only 23 games for the White Sox and that 1992 will match that.&quot;It ain't over - there's no fat lady singing,&quot; said McKee. &quot;Look,Nike'snamed buildings after Bo.

"RUGGED defender Andrew Marth yesterday admitted he has not yet hit his best form despite the recent media clamor for his inclusion in the Socceroos.The switch by Marth to a double centre-back role has helped Melbourne Croatia challenge for the NSL championship and earned praise from national coach Eddie Thomson who said the defender was on the verge of a call-up.Thomson took note of how Marth and George Hannah blotted out Warren Spink last Sunday. Only days earlier Spink had troubled Czechoslovakia with his sharpness and confidence to take defenders on.&nbsp;Marth also took the free kick which led to the winning goal against Preston Makedonia.While Marth concedes that his form is improving, he believes he has played better in the NSL.&quot;My second season at Sunshine George Cross (in 1988) was my best season and I ended up being the club's player of the year,&quot; Marth said yesterday.&quot;I still think I haven't played as well since although this season is now shaping up to go close.&quot;Marth is now part of Melbourne Croatia's ambitious charge for the title.&quot;The change of coach (at Melbourne Croatia) has made a big difference.

MISSOURI FOOD BARN Official Says Business Returning Business dropped by about 18 percent during the first couple weeks of a strike that began March 3 but has since started to come back, a Food Barn official said in Kansas City.  P.A. Rawalt, Food Barn's vice president of human resources, said the company's business had increased by about 9.5 percent two weeks ago and another 3 percent last week.  The union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 576, has claimed business is down by 75 percent.  Rawalt also said 1,048 employees have crossed the union picket lines, which couldn't be immediately confirmed by union officials. The local represents about 2,500 Food Barn employees, about 2,100 of them union members, at 47 stores in Missouri and Kansas, most in the Kansas City area.&nbsp;The union members went on strike after soundly rejecting a new contract that would have required about $18 million in concessions over three years.  Rawalt said Food Barn is the only remaining unionized grocery in the Kansas City area and can't continue to compete.  AP ILLINOIS CATERPILLAR INC.  195 Employees To Be Laid Off Caterpillar Inc. said Thursday that 195 hourly employees will be laid off indefinitely from the company's Peoria-area plants, effective April 1.  The layoffs are necessary to bring production of diesel engines in line with demand, according to a statement from the company. Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of tractors and other earth-moving equipment.  It employed about 60,000 people overall as of mid-1990.  AP NATIONAL L.A. GEAR RivalNikeSued In 'Sneaker War' L.A. Gear Inc. Thursday launched a counter-offensive in the ''sneaker war,'' firing a $3 billion lawsuit at rivalNikeInc. that charged it with trying to monopolize the market for high-tech sneakers and drive L.A.  Gear out of the business.  The countersuit was filed afterNike,the nation's largest marketer of athletic footwear, last month sued L.A. Gear for alleged patent infringement.  In its countersuit, L.A. Gear said it believesNikeis trying to monopolize the high-technology basketball shoe market and eliminate L.A. Gear as a major competitor.  Los Angeles-based L.A. Gear also said its countersuit denies that its new CATAPULT shoe technology infringes anyNikepatents.  In its suit, filed in federal court in California on Feb. 15,Nikehad alleged that six models of basketball shoes sold by L.A. Gear infringe on patents forNike'sAir Jordan shoes.  Reuters FDIC Bank Insurance Fund Shrank 37 The nation's bank insurance fund shrank 37 percent last year and will probably need to borrow $10 billion this year to keep bailing out depositors of failed banks, a top banking regulator said Thursday.  L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said the FDIC's fund suffered an operating loss of $4.85 billion in 1990.  ''To be conservative and to ensure that we have the funds we need on time, we will need, we believe, at least $10 billion this year and that could be higher if we experience conditions worse than we currently are forecasting,'' Seidman said.  He also warned that the fund may have to borrow $35 billion by the end of 1993 - part of a new Treasury proposal that would let it borrow up to $70 billion to protect depositors.  Reuters INTERNATIONAL AVIATION EC Asks For New Trade Agreement The European Community, locked in a dispute with Washington on whether its subsidies on Airbus aircraft violate free trade rules, asked Thursday for a new trade agreement to make clear what government support was allowed.  It asked the Civil Aircraft Committee of the 101-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to renegotiate GATT's Civil Aircraft Code to clarify the matter and avoid such disputes, a trade source said.  The United States charges that European subsidies to the four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium unfairly cut into the market of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.

"Reebok International Ltd. wants advertising that's as hot as its shoes.Its new ad campaign goes toe-to-toe with rivalNikeInc. in the pithy advice department.&nbsp;The first ad, airing during Monday Night Football, shows a ''sky surfer'' - a white-clad sky diver riding a snow board - somersaulting above the French Alps in his Pump cross-training shoes. The theme: ''Life is short. Play hard.''Reebok, which will spend $ 25 million on the campaign, scored with the Pump - 4 million pairs sold in 18 months - and its Blacktop outdoor basketball shoes. Second-quarter revenue rose 30% over 1990. The company commands 24% of $ 6 billion-a-year athletic -shoe market toNike's30%.But when it comes to great ads,Nikehas gotten all the airtime. Their star-filled ads are virtual news events and their slogans - from ''Just do it'' to ''Bo knows'' - quickly become buzzwords. Meanwhile, Reebok has suffered a depressing series of gaffes: Its wacky ''U.B.U.'' series flopped and a bungee-jumping ad was yanked last year for implying aNikewearer fell to his death.''Nikehas known for a long time what they stand for,'' says Dick Sittig, new creative director of ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo New York, which lost the account after the bungee spot but won it back this year. ''They've had the advantage of getting a head start.''The Pump's success lets Reebok present itself as a serious sports shoe. Earlier ads talked form at the expense of performance, says David Ropes, vice president of marketing. ''It's like we were a teenager, we were feeling our oats. We're still a teenager, but now we know what we want to be when we grow up.''",0.119476010101,0.430082070707,275 words,Reebok ads 'play hard',1991-08-02 00:00:00,578 of 998 DOCUMENTS,USA TODAY
"A coach shouldn't worry about losing money if his school takes over&nbsp;negotiating his outside-income contract, according to NCAA executive&nbsp;director Dick Schultz, who handled that chore for his staff when he was&nbsp;athletics director at Virginia.&quot;Our coaches made more money because I was a better negotiator than&nbsp;they were,&quot; Schultz said at the NCAA's recent annual football forum in&nbsp;Kansas City, Mo.Schultz said Virginia in 1982 became the first school to turn the&nbsp;negotiating of coaches' TV/radio contracts and other deals over to the&nbsp;athletics department. Other schools using the practice include Clemson,&nbsp;Florida State, Florida and Kentucky.&nbsp;Athletics director Vince Dooley is instituting a similar policy at&nbsp;Georgia and strongly hinted that it would be expanded to include shoe&nbsp;contracts.Schultz and Dooley predict the consolidation of outside-income&nbsp;contracts will become a national trend.&quot;The college presidents feel more comfortable with it coming under&nbsp;the university and the control of the athletics department,&quot; Dooley said.Schultz said Virginia had contracts with three shoe manufacturers,&nbsp;and teams other than football and basketball benefited from those&nbsp;contracts.Georgia basketball coach Hugh Durham is paid $ 40,000 annually for&nbsp;endorsingNikeshoes and $ 40,000 to do speeches and clinics for the shoe&nbsp;company - plus $ 2,000 in merchandise.

"A range of stainless steel rams designed to withstand the most arduous operating conditions was introduced to the UK at Offshore Europe byNike.The company, Scandinavia's largest manufacturer of high pressure hydraulics, also used the Aberdeen show to launch its Reflex lightweight helicopter rescue kit, which offers separate tools for heavy cutting, pushing, and cutting in confined spaces.&quot;Offshore Europe provided our first opportunity to display a selected range of high pressure, heavy duty hydraulic equipment,&quot; says Hall Smith, president ofNikeHydraulics Ltd, of Burnley, Britain.  In addition,Nike'sdisplay embraced pumps for manual, air, and electrical operation as well as hydraulic cutting equipment.&nbsp;&quot;Nikehas been in the hydraulic business for more than 60 years, originally as a supplier of products for the automotive industry,&quot; says Mr Smith.  &quot;It has gradually moved into products employed in heavy industries like mining, steel, pulp, paper, and the offshore sector.&quot;The acquisition in 1988 of Bahco, Sweden's second largest manufacturer of power tools, can be seen as a significant step in this expansion process.  Bahco had long historical links with the oil industry, both offshore and on land, and its range of heavy lift rams had a good reputation amongst fabricators.The new ram range presented in Aberdeen offers the same performance as the established CXA range used in heavy fabrication yards, combined with enhanced corrosion resistance due to its stainless steel construction.The Reflex rescue kit has been developed from Bahco's original range of rescue tools, and can be used either individually or simultaneously by up to three operators.  It supplements existing heavy duty rescue tools currently supplied byNikefor offshore duties.  Cutting and spreading tools, have been modified for subsea operation by remotely operated vehicles.Since the Bahco acquisition, says Mr Smith, a great deal of rationalisation has taken place in theNikeproduct range, supplemented by the introduction of new tools.  &quot;This has given the company one of the most comprehensive lines on the market,&quot; he argues.Standard rams can now be offered with capacities up to 250 tonnes, while low height, spring return rams are available with up to 200 tonnes capacity, and a range of specialist hand pumps, developing pressure up to 2,800 bar (40,000 psi).GRAPHIC:Picture, The Reflect lightweight rescue kit fromNikeis designed for helicopter use and provides separate tools for heavy cutting and pushing in confined spaces.",0.0254323725055,0.480424981523,398 words,Hydraulics firm launches rams and rescue kit,1991-10-04 00:00:00,583 of 998 DOCUMENTS,THE OILMAN
"NikeInc. sells a lot of shoes at its store in hometown Portland, but it also gives something away: fantasy.ItsNikeTown is a theatrical presentation, a glittering production number starring the customers.&quot;People love to shop.  It's kind of entertainment, a social thing,&quot; manager Mary Burns said.  &quot;Let's make it even more fun for them . . .&quot;&nbsp;Outside in downtown Portland are the sights, sounds, and smells of rush-hour traffic, intent pedestrians, fastfood restaurants.But insideNikeTown, you can relax in the tranquility of an open town square, with the sounds of birds chirping.  The square, like the atrium of a suburban mall, is surrounded by two levels of separate shopping areas for differentNikeproducts.Light from a huge sparkling billboard highlights the uneven texture of brick walls and pavement and shines off manhole covers.&quot;Isn't it something?&quot; says customer Vernette Stowers.  &quot;I drove all the way from Seattle.  My daughter is aNikefan.&quot;&quot;I don't think we meant to come up with some incredible turning point in retail or anything,&quot; saidNikeTown designer Gordon Thompson.  &quot;We wanted to come up with a store that accurately represented our company and it happened to be this.&quot;The funniest thing is, I knew we were doing something unusual in architecture and design and in retail, but it seems to me it sort of has a life of its own now.&quot;In a half-hour on a recent afternoon, the store's greeter counted 200 people entering the store.  On weekends, it's even busier.&quot;We are averaging on a Saturday up to about 4,000-5,000 people,&quot; said Cathy Taylor, vice president of retail forNike, based in suburban Beaverton.&quot;The last two Sunday mornings I've had 75 people in line waiting to get into the store at 11:30,&quot; Burns said.Thompson, an architect by training, worked in industrial and interior design before coming toNike.  He said he always had &quot;a big admiration for set designers and movies.&quot;His fascination took him to Universal Studios in Hollywood, where he visited sound stages and theBack to the Futureset, which features a town square.&quot;I started sketching on the way back,&quot; he said.The retail areas surrounding the square highlight each collection with separate character.A basketball area has wooden truss ceilings and a wooden basketball court floor.  A recording and speakers beneath the raised floor subtly fill the space with the hollow bounce of basketballs and shoes squeaking on the court.Bright tropical fish swim around shoes from the Aqua Gear collection in vertical, cylindrical tanks.  Nine large TV screens set in the floor form a sort of video pond, in which customers can watch seaweed swaying among the coral on the floor of a warm ocean.To keep inventory from cluttering the sales area, shoes are stored a floor below.  Shoes of the desired style, size, and color can be called up from the stockroom at a moment's notice by computer.  They arrive in a basket on a conveyor that moves up through a transparent plastic tube.&quot;It came fromThe Jetsons,&quot; Thompson said, referring to the futuristic cartoon series.Neither Burns nor Taylor would provide sales figures, but Burns said the store, since opening in November 1990, &quot;did exactly what we wanted it to.&quot;Response has been so strong,Nikeplans a larger store in Chicago, taking over the old Saks Fifth Avenue location.  The Chicago store will contain about 33,000 square feet of retail space, compared with Portland's 7,000 square feet, and its town square will be five stories tall, Taylor said.

"The US sports shoe and apparel maker has gone to town with a store concept that combines hi-tech gadgetry with environmental design to produce a sort of Disneyland and Hard Rock Cafe of the athletics world, says Helen ChangON a downtown street corner, in the small city of Portland, Oregon, is a store that opens into another world.Step into the darkened porch, then through the black sliding doors, and you enter a marketing marvel -NikeTown.Inside is a &quot;town square&quot; lined with boutiques on all sides. Above the square, a white plaster statue of US basketball star Michael Jordan leaps through the air, while to the left, a balcony overlooks the scene.&nbsp;NikeTown combines hi-tech gadgetry with environmental design to produce a sort of Disneyland and Hard Rock Cafe of the athletics world. Conceived as a gallery to sell the latest lines ofNikeshoes and clothing under one roof, it demonstrates how a store's atmosphere is as much a marketing tool as the products themselves.The atmosphere inNikeTown is like a theatre stage. Dark and light shadows canvass the various boutiques. Environmental music -the sounds of chirping birds and running streams -- fills the air.Even the store hours are offbeat: Monday to Thursday 10am -7.01pm; Friday 10am -8pm; Saturday 10am -6.52pm; Sunday 11.25am -6.23pm.NikeTown is the flagship store of the US sports shoe and apparel maker, whose worldwide headquarters -directing operations in the US, Europe and Asia -are at Beaverton, about a 20- minute drive from Portland.Nikewill not say how much revenue the store brings in, or how much it cost to build, but it is repeating the concept elsewhere.A secondNikeTown opened recently in Chicago and there plans to create up to eight more in the US in the next decade.Nikealso plans to spread the chain to Europe, but there are no current plans for Asia.Already, the Portland store has developed a cult following. Out-of-state teenagers come to see memorabilia displays to check what a favourite athlete wore during a certain game. Others sit at video displays by the half-hour. And Japanese tourists make their way to Portland just to see the store.&quot;We wanted to create product excitement,&quot; said store manager Jeff Nichols, about the reasons forNikeTown's design. &quot;We wanted to make an exciting place (for customers) to look at our products.&quot;During a recent interview,Nikefounder and chief executive officer Philip Knight said: &quot;One of the key things we try to do is to create an emotional tie with a product.&quot;Launched in 1990, Portland'sNikeTown has floor space of 15,000 sq ft, about the size of a supermarket. It draws some 40,000 visitors a year, split equally between locals and tourists.Each of the store's 14 boutiques highlights a different sport or theme -such as running, cycling, tennis or kids' wear -with decor and furniture to match.A boutique forNike'sline of hiking and mountain-climbing shoes and clothes, called All Conditions Gear, features a backdrop that changes from day to night, including a shimmering sunrise which turns to stars against a black sky. Display shelves are made from rock-climbing wires and pegs, and the floor is made from slate rock.Another boutique, containingNike's&quot;Aqua-Gear&quot;, includes an aquarium window filled with bright tropical fish. Outside the aquarium, balanced on horizontal wire lines, are mesh shoes -used for walking on reefs -whose bright colours match those of the fish.In the same room, surfboards protruding from the walls double as shelves, while a video &quot;pool&quot; on the floor shows footage of running water and coral reef life.The store also serves as a mini sports museum, with displays of sporting memorabilia spread throughout. One panel features the different shoes worn by basketball star Michael Jordan in various national tournaments.&quot;People will just come in and read the memorabilia,&quot; said sales associate Hal Melhart.  &quot;They'll come in here for two hours, before they realise they can shop.&quot;Sales staff don't spend much time getting the apparel from the shelves -small, hi-tech lifts do that. Instead, sales assistants are encouraged to &quot;educate&quot; visitors aboutNikeproducts.Some say the fervour ofNikeTown's employees -everyone is involved in some kind of sport -can be overwhelming. And retailing experts say the marketing efforts do not necessarily add up to more sales, since many visitors do not buy. At the day's end, they say, it's quality that will sell the products, not gimmicks.ButNikesays its stores provide what today's customers want: fun. And in a way that is fast becoming a slice of Americana.GRAPHIC:InsideNikeTown: The company says its stores provide what today's customers want -fun",0.107796451914,0.446008403361,1440 words,A town likeNike's,1992-11-05 00:00:00,586 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Business Times (Singapore)
"The official Olympic motto is:A. Just Do It.B. Citius. Altius. Fortius.C. Life Is Short. Play Hard.The answer depends on whom you ask. The International Olympic Committee stands by B, Latin for faster, higher, stronger.&nbsp;But in the marketing-crazed world of sports that is unavoidably married to the modern Games, mass-media advertising campaigns have sought to condition consumers to pick A (Nike)or C (Reebok).Which brings us to Michael Jordan's wardrobe quandary.He is under contract, for a reported $ 20 million, to endorseNikeand its Air Jordan shoes and related accessories.Jordan had said he was considering not taking part in a medal ceremony if he had to wear a Reebok uniform. Reebok is the official supplier to the U.S. Olympic Committee and paid to have all U.S. Olympians wear Reebok suits on the award stand.Jordan and five other basketball Olympians have contracts withNike.USOC executive director Harvey Schiller said Sunday that the flap - which might have meant no Jordan and others on the medal stand if the team wins the gold - is a ''non-issue. We have a deal.'' He wouldn't elaborate.Said Jordan: ''I don't know anything about it, but if it's true, that's good.''Said NBA Commissioner David Stern: ''The matter of who wears what when is going to be resolved, and I'm sure we'll have all 12 players up there.''WhileNikeand Reebok are maintaining low profiles in the Jordan case, it has magnified the role of sponsors and Olympic commercialism.Sports administrators and corporate marketing officials contend brand- name exposure is a natural and necessary byproduct that rewards huge investments by footwear manufacturers and other sponsors. ''Michael Jordan is not the problem; he earns a substantial living with or without endorsements,'' says Liz Dolan,Nike'svice president for corporate communication.''The people for whom (no money) would be a problem are the ones whose sponsors really support them.''Dolan saysNikedoes not object to Jordan making a brief appearance in Reebok's USA suit to accept an Olympic medal because ''that's ceremonial garb, and that's not the business we're in anyway.''Should Jordan follow through on his pledge to boycott the medal ceremony and snub the Reebok outfit, don't expect a Reebok counterattack. You probably won't hear so much as a peep.''That doesn't have any impact on Reebok,'' says John Boulter, vice president of worldwide marketing for Reebok International Ltd.''But I would feel sorry for any athlete who did that. It would be a shame if it ended like that.''",0.114583333333,0.396759259259,431 words,USOC says clothing controversy over,1992-08-03 00:00:00,588 of 998 DOCUMENTS,USA TODAY
"Questions surroundingNikeInc.'s future earnings let some air out of its stock Thursday. The maker of Air Jordan and other pricey athletic shoes dropped 4 1/4 to $ 46 5/8 after two analysts scaled back their quarterly and yearly earnings estimates for the company.Shearson Lehman Bros. analyst Josie Esquivel shaved her third-quarter estimate to 92 cents a share from $ 1. For the year ending in May, she cut her estimate to $ 4 a share from $ 4.13. Montgomery Securities analyst Alice Ruth cut her estimate to 95 cents a share from $ 1.10 for the third quarter and to $ 3.85 from $ 4 for the year. Both cited a 33% drop inNike's''refill'' orders for the third quarter. Refill orders are spot orders from retailers to shore up their inventories.&nbsp;Still, Esquivel says the soft market for athletic shoes that cost more than $ 100 a pair will be temporary. She ''strongly reiterated'' her buy recommendation. But Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Gary Jacobson saysNikeis facing a period of slow growth. With the slack economy, ''we're beginning to see customers shift away from high-priced footwear to lower priced shoes,'' he says. ''In a tough retail environment, if you have a high-priced item, you'll likely have problems.''He recommends shunningNikestock in favor of arch-competitor Reebok International, which fell 1/4 to $ 17 5/8 Thursday. He thinks more modestly priced shoes such as Reebok's Freestyle and Princess lines are poised for higher sales in a less ostentatious decade.Profit-taking Time: Buoyed all week on rumors of an imminent deal to sell portions of its entertainment businesses, Time Warner Inc. lost 4 3/4 to $ 110 3/4 a share as traders took profits.

"Perhaps it's just an excuse to sell sneakers for $ 100 a pop -- but what an excuse.Walk through the doors ofNikeTown, and the first thing you see is a life-size plaster statue of Mr.Nikehimself -- Michael Jordan -- in mid-jump shot. To either side the walls are papered with Sports Illustrated covers featuring athletes who've endorsedNikeproducts.And that's all before you get to the basketball court, the 22-foot-long, 1,000-gallon tank with live tropical fish, and the video theater where you can watch your favorite athletes work out on film, inNikeapparel.&nbsp;And the amazing dancing bears who do cartwheels before slamming the basketball home!Well, scratch the dancing bears.Nikedidn't go that far when it set up its giant new five-story retail emporium along North Michigan Avenue, Chicago's so-called Magnificent Mile of fancy boutiques and department stores. But the company appears to have spared few other expenses in designing and building what is more a color-coordinated sports museum -- the Disney World of athletics may be more like it -- than a shoe store.&quot;It's dope,&quot; says Larry Cowans, a 13-year-old from nearby Skokie who is spending the afternoon wandering around the store with his older brother. &quot;That means cool,&quot; he quickly informs a befuddled questioner.Cowans, a self-described aficionado of basketball star Charles Barkley, is what you might also call a sports-marketing dream. He's wearing a Georgetown Hoyas T-shirt and gym shorts and a Georgia Tech baseball cap. On his feet are a pair ofNikebasketball sneakers.But it's not just the aficionados who have hadNike'scash registers ringing furiously ever sinceNikeTown opened here a few weeks ago. On any given afternoon, the store is packed with hundreds of shoppers -- suburban housewives, packs of teenagers on summer vacation and scads of tourists who have added it to their Chicago agendas.&quot;I'd heard this is the place to come visit,&quot; says Clarke Reeves, an Indianapolis schoolteacher who drove up for a Cubs game. &quot;It's kind of like an entertainment center. Instead of having to spend money, you can just browse.&quot;Well, he did buy some T-shirts for the kids.Reeves is exactly the kind of customer who has Vince Giacomin wearing a perpetual smile these days. Giacomin is the manager ofNikeTown. He estimates that at least 5,000 people a day have visited the store since its opening, perhaps as many as 10,000 on a good day.To put that into perspective, consider this: The Art Institute, another tourist destination only a half-dozen blocks south on Michigan Avenue, averages only 3,000 to 4,000 visitors a day. The Museum of Science and Industry gets perhaps 5,000 or 6,000.&quot;This is the store to go to,&quot; boasts Giacomin. &quot;Every time you come in here, you see something you didn't see before -- because there's so much to see.&quot;As Giacomin explains it,NikeTown represents in part the company's response to the recession. &quot;Retail is struggling in general,&quot; he says. &quot;The retailer only knows to put a four-letter word on the front door: SALE. We've taken a totally different approach. We're talking about creating a different environment for shopping.&quot;NikeTown Chicago is actually the secondNikeTown. The first was a similar, albeit much smaller, store in Portland, Ore., near the company's headquarters. NowNikeis planning to take the concept national, establishing a kind of Hard Rock Cafe for the sneaker and leisure fields. It has been scouting sites in Atlanta, New York and Orange County, Calif. There's even talk of going international, in London or Berlin.Given all the hoopla over the Olympic Dream Team, it's not hard to understand the mania here overNikeTown, a veritable shrine to America's most famous athletes -- many of whom, it turns out, endorseNikeproducts. Giant statues of Dream Teamers Scottie Pippen and David Robinson hang from the rafters. Window displays tout the accomplishments of Ukraine's champion pole vaulter Sergei Bubka and long jumper Mike Powell. You can even see the sleek black &quot;bat boot&quot; worn by Michael Keaton in &quot;Batman.&quot; (Yup, it was designed byNike.)Innovative design touches turn up in unlikely places. The door handles are sculpted like theNikewings on the side of sneakers. Clerks retrieve shoes from the stock room through plastic tubes that transport the sneakers along a pulley system. As you shop for tennis shoes, the sounds of people smacking tennis balls can be heard over the Brian Eno-esque music on the stereo system, but as you walk into the basketball area, they are replaced by the noisy shouts of a playground hoops match.Of course, the biggest shrine of all here is to Chicago's reigning prince, Bulls guard Michael Jordan. A whole section of the store is devoted to the Air Jordan line of shoes, socks, T-shirts, sweat pants and gym shorts (for $ 38 a pair; there's a half-basketball court too, for trying on your new shoes).

"Bob Van Kampen confirmed Friday that his new firm,NikeSecurities, is negotiating with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates Inc. to buy its packaged products division.He said that while the deal has not yet been finalized, he expected the matter to be resolved by Oct. 1.&quot;We've been in discussions working with them and trying to come to an agreement,&quot; Mr. Van Kampen stated. &quot;I believe we are moving to a resolution, but it's not a deal yet.&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Brown, the firm's chairman, could not be reached for comment.Clayton Brown has sold about $6.5 billion of unit investment trusts since 1974, and employs 40 to 45 people in its packaged products division, according to the firm's marketing department.Clayton Brown was once a part of a firm - Van Kampen Wauterlek &amp; Co. - that Mr. Van Kampen started in 1967. Seven years later the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates.Mr. Van Kampen said he was &quot;very saddened&quot; that the confidentiality of the negotiations was &quot;breached&quot; when Clayton Brown sent an internal memo to its packaged product employees saying they would continue to be employed either at Clayton Brown or atNike.Mr. Van Kampen startedNikein May, less than a month after Van Kampen Merritt Inc., the firm he formed in 1974 and sold to Xerox Financial Services in 1984, announced it was dropping its investment banking business to concentrate on its asset management business that includes mutual funds and unit investment trusts.One municipal finance source said, &quot;He's coming back in a big way to compete with Van Kampen Merritt.&quot;A spokesman for Van Kampen Merritt did not return phone calls.As of April, the firm had sold $19 billion of unit investment trusts and was the largest U.S. sponsor of insured tax-free unit trust investments.Mr. Van Kampen said that all &quot;non-compete&quot; agreements that he made with Xerox at the time he sold the firm had since expired. He explained that the idea to acquire Clayton Brown's unit trust business occurred whenNikeacquired &quot;a key&quot; packaged product employee from Clayton Brown who &quot;felt there would be a possibility Clayton Brown would be interested in selling the whole department.&quot;Mr. Van Kampen saidNike, which is operating out of temporary quarters in West Chicago, Ill., employs 20 people - including some former Van Kampen Merritt employees - involved in the trading, underwriting and sale of tax-exempt and taxable bonds to institutional investors.The sale of its packaged products division would not have a great effect on Clayton Brown's business, according to one public finance official.&quot;They haven't been among the majors in that area,&quot; the source said. &quot;They've been focusing on public finance, doing a lot of work as a co manager.&quot;CORRECTION:Bob Van Kampen, chairman ofNikeSecurities, clarified a comment he made in an article that appeared yesterday about negotiations between his firm and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates to purchase Clayton Brown's packaged products division.Mr. Van Kampen said the confidentiality of the negotiations was breached by an unknown person and that, as a result, officials at Clayton Brown issued a memo to its employees saying they would continue to be employed either at Clayton Brown orNike.",-0.00751262626263,0.316856060606,468 words,NikeSecurities Attempting to Purchase A Division of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates,1991-09-03 00:00:00,604 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Bond Buyer

"IN THE RUNNING battle of the footwear makers,NikeInc. has further advanced its lead over L.A. Gear Inc. The Marina del Rey, Calif.-based company reported its seventh straight quarterly loss Wednesday while rivalNikeof Beaverton, Ore., reported its fifth straight year of record revenues and earnings.Nikeshares jumped more than 10 per cent Wednesday while L.A.

Gear reported a net loss of $ 24.4 million US ($ 1.19 a share) for the second quarter ended May 31 compared with a net loss of $ 4 million (20 cents) in the like period a year ago.Revenue was $ 104.7 million vs. $ 166 million.L.A. Gear attributed its loss in part to settling three shareholder suits, at $ 13.9 million against net earnings, as well as a loss from continuing operations.The lawsuits alleged insider trading and release of false financial statements and prospects for the company. Filed in 1990 and 1991, they name L.A. Gear and current and former officials, including founder Robert Greenberg. The company said the settlements are not admissions of guilt.Court approval for the settlements is expected in late August.L.A. Gear president and chief operating officer Mark Goldston said losses are expected to continue into the latter half of 1992.L.A. Gear installed new management in September after Roy Disney-led Trefoil Capital Investors in Burbank, Calif., bailed out the firm with a $ 100-million investment convertible to a 34-per-cent stake.Since then, new management has been intent on cutting expenses, streamlining company operations and consolidating shoe lines. Still, losses have continued to plague the company since the fourth quarter of fiscal 1990.Meanwhile,Nikeearned $ 70.7 million US (92 cents a share) in the fourth quarter ended May 31 compared with $ 58.6 million (76 cents) in the same period a year ago.

"By Brian FawcettESQUIRE magazine, which carries the subtitle of Man At His Best butreally ought to be subtitled Upper Middle-class New York Guys Between 35and 50 At Their Most Cynical and Stylish, used to be one of the bestmagazines this side of the Atlantic. It was politically and sociallyastute if not always liberal, the prose was high-octane, and its annualDubious Achievement Awards, begun in the 1960s, were the best summary andsatire of our lunatic civilization available.These days, alas, the magazine is usually more in step with ourparanoid sectarian times than it once was, and the most I'd be willing tosay about it is that it features good prose. The April 1991 issue, whichexhibits a photo of actress Ellen Barkin, has, between pages 64 and 65, aneight-page fold-out that will tell you more about corporate sponsorship ofthe arts than the magazine intended, and probably a whole lot more thanmost of us ever wanted to know.&nbsp;On the front and back of the fold-out are miniaturized reproductions offive commissioned works of art. Charles Anderson (U.S.), Ralph Steadman(British) and Takenobu Igarushi (Japanese) are on the front, and AlphonseHoltgreve (German) and Andre Francois (French) cover the rear. All fiveartists were evidently contracted to interpret a single numerical icon -the number 180 - and to integrate it within what is presumably theirrecognizable style.THE perpetrator isNikeCorp., whose slogan, &quot;Just do it,&quot; has becomethe low-density battle cry for a generation of narcissistic physicalactivists engaged in slicking up their bodies while a third of the worldsuffers from malnutrition.The offending fold-out is an ad forNike'snew running shoe, theNike180 Air. The middle four pages are a masterpiece of high-style technicalgibberish about the new runner, done up in neo-Albrecht Durer with water-colour renderings first of the shoe, and then of a skinless foot sittingin it. Also included are a nonsensical architectural plan view of theshoe's sole, and a couple of indecipherable technical drawings aimed atconvincing us of the 180's high-tech perfection.The written text, printed in Spanish, German, Japanese and English,informs us thatNike'svaunted air-cushioning unit (a see-through shellthat contains air and thus makes the shoe lighter), has been made 50 percent larger for the 180 runner.On the two remaining pages of the fold-out are silver-tone cheesecakephotos of the new 180 in hot pink, navy and white. With its see-throughair unit, the runner doesn't quite strike me as the Ellen Barkin ofrunning shoes, who is after all, a woman of complexity and substance. The180 is actually the opposite - a testimony to the degree to whichabsolutely nothing can be aggrandized.So what am I offended at, here, anyway? Well, practically everythingabout theNikefold-out offends me. Nowhere in the eight pages does itadmit that it is an advertisement. Au contraire, the fold-out is marked &quot;confidential&quot; in five places, leading us to believe that it must be aninformation leak that Esquire somehow got hold of. That it is addressed tosomeone named T. Hatfield, a name that does not appear on the Esquiremasthead, seems to confirm this. The apparent authours of the informationleak are three guys in Beaverton, Ore., which is presumably the site ofNike'sdesign headquarters.BUT what is most offensive here is that it tells us how the corporatesector will, in the end, nurture and sponsor the arts. In this case, thework of five-star visual artists serves as the fold-out's coverdecoration, and, by implication, as an illustration of how interested inhelping out the artsNikeis.It also tells us that after a half-century of trying to integrate thearts within the communities whose values and problems they are supposed toreflect and articulate, we're headed back to the dark days when art wasn'tby the masters, but for them.Brian Fawcett is a Vancouver writer and author of Public Eye: AnInvestigation into the Disappearance of the World (Harper Collins).",0.132034632035,0.320373376623,666 words,"PUBLIC EYE   FIFTH COLUMN   When running shoes and art   meet, art ends up getting   trampled, says Brian Fawcett",1991-05-10 00:00:00,629 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Globe and Mail (Canada)

On Feb. 3, 1990, Concordia ended a five-year, 0-47 losing streak.It's Hickey's second time as head coach of the Stingers. He coached the women's team from 1976 to 1985, during which Concordia reached the CIAU national tournament four times.Upon his return, Hickey said his first priorities were to make the women's program &quot;enjoyable again&quot; and Concordia the class of the Quebec league.He appears to have succeeded on the first matter, but returning Concordia to its previous glory days might take longer than anticipated.",0.125449810606,0.322940340909,466 words,Stingers face test; Tip-off with Bisons in tourney,1991-11-14 00:00:00,634 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)"

"IF the shoe fits, wear it. Especially on the Olympic gold-medal stand. And especially if you're getting paid to wear it. But if your Olympic team warm-up suit doesn't fit your portfolio of contracts, don't wear it. Especially on the gold-medal stand.More and more, the United States Olympic team is populated not so much by athletes from all over America as by athletes from manufacturers of athletic apparel with brand names that sound like newly discovered planets. Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley fromNike.Carl Lewis from Mizuno. Dave Johnson (and his decathlon rival who didn't make the team, Dan O'Brien) from Reebok.&nbsp;In the confusion, Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley think they're here representingNikeinstead of the United States.When the two Dream Team basketball players learned that on the gold-medal stand next Saturday night they would be expected to wear official red, white and blue United States warmup suits with the planet Reebok logo, they threatened not to appear at the ceremony.&quot;I don't believe in endorsing my competition,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;I feel very strongly abut loyalty to my own company.&quot;Upon hearing of Jordan's loyalty to his company, cynics wondered about his loyalty to his country. He's here because he grew up playing basketball in the United States, not because he's an alien from the planetNikeon loan to the Olympic team.As for loyalty to his company, how loyal was Jordan to Coca-Cola when Gatorade offered him more money?Gatorade's slogan is &quot;Be Like Mike.&quot; But if he doesn't appear at the gold-medal ceremony in his official Olympic warm-up suit, a new slogan suddenly might be more fashionable: Don't Be Like Mike.Don't be like Charles Barkley either.The Dream Team's other international diplomat explained: &quot;UsNikeguys are loyal toNikebecause they pay us a lot of money. I have two million reasons not to wear Reebok.&quot; As if those two million reasons, not to mention his other millions of reasons, were generated on the planetNikerather than in the nation he's representing.It's not that Jordan and Barkley didn't know this all along. According to Rule 14 of the code of conduct signed by every United States Olympic athlete, medal winners will wear apparel supplied by the United States Olympic Committee at award ceremonies.&quot;This rule,&quot; said Harvey Schiller, the U.S.O.C. executive director, &quot;was approved by the Athletes Advisory Council and all athletes on our teams are expected to abide by it and all other portions of the code. It is mandatory policy that any athlete taking part in an official medal ceremoney in Barcelona will wear this apparel, without exception.&quot;Jordan signed that agreement. But as an alien from the planetNike,he crossed out Rule 14.Reebok is one of 40 corporate sponsors that contribute $160 million to the U.S.O.C. treasury.&quot;The money we're getting for wearing the official warm-up suit is going to assist thousands of athletes in training,&quot; said Mike Moran, the U.S.O.C. director of public information. &quot;No athlete will stand on the medal platform without this suit.&quot;To their credit, four other Dream Team members from the planetNikehave not objected to wearing the Reebok warm-up suit at the gold-medal ceremony: Chris Mullin, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson and John Stockton.Through the years, Olympic athletes have prospered from their contracts with manufacturers of athletic shoes. When Mike Powell, anotherNikealien, set the world long-jump record in Tokyo last year, Joe Douglas, the manager of Carl Lewis from the planet Mizuno, turned to Powell's agent, Brad Hunt, and said, &quot;You just cost my guy a million dollars.&quot;Until now, no United States Olympian ever objected to wearing the official team warm-up suit with a rival logo.But until now, the planetNikewas never so prominent.

"&nbsp;AFTER A PERIOD of double-digit growth in the mid-1980s, the athletic footwear market has plateaued.  In 1990 the U.S. market hit $11.9 billion on 393 million pairs of athletic footwear. That represents only a 1 percent increase in units and a 10 percent sales gain, the smallest jump since 1984.  ''The overall athletic footwear market has reached a difficult point for manufacturers, as the recession and price competition from casual shoes are having some impact,'' says Sebastian DiCasoli, SGMA's director of marketing sales.  Still, despite concern over cost, four out of every 10 shoes sold in the United States are athletic-style. In addition, DiCasoli says, the possibility of strong sales for athletic footwear looks bright because of greater participation in fitness walking and the continued promotion of outdoor and cross-training shoes.  In an effort to spur the static market, companies are continuously bringing out new shoes.  ''Without a doubt, the newest meaningful development is the system of air bladders, started by Reebok,'' says Bob Gillespie, a store manager for the Allied Sporting Goods chain. ''Nikenow has an air-pressure system and L.A.  Gear uses it in their R egulator Series.'' The air-pressure system provides the wearer with a custom fit. The shoe conforms to the foot, no matter what the configuration.  On the premise that if air can make a shoe conform to the foot it also can make a glove conform to the hand, Spalding and Mizuno have come out with baseball gloves featuring the air system.&nbsp;Gillespie says his most popular shoe isNike's$130 Charles Barkley model.  ''All the kids want it,'' he says, referring to the black low-cut shoe which makes the air bladder visible through the shoe's mid-sole.  ''There are probably better basketball shoes on the market but this happens to be the one that's hot right now,'' says Gillespie, whose store's price points are from $29.99 for a standard leather tennis shoe to $150 forNike'sAir Force 180 high top with air-system arch and ankle supports.  Popular as the air-system shoes are, one pro shop manager and buyer is not a fan.  ''I've had a lot of bad luck with pump shoes,'' says Barbara Ensner of Evansville, Ind. ''Reebok is making a pump walking shoe in which the pump malfunctions.'' Her shop does well theNike'sChallenge model, worn by top-ranked tennis pro Andre Agassi, Wilson's Pro Staff tennis shoe, and Head's Sonic, a tri-court shoe for racquetball, tennis or basketball.  Another new shoe is the $125 Brooks ''Fusion'' model, with a shock-reducing fusion plate that bends with the wearer and snaps back into place, producing a rebound effect. It's rated tops by Runner's World magazine.  ''The air bag has been around since the late '70s, but the fusion plate is newer,'' says Jim Nolan, a shoe store manager.  Nolan's best selling shoe is stillNike'sAir Jordan, named for Chicago Bulls forward, Michael Jordan. ''It's a basketball shoe,'' Nolan says, ''but 90 percent of my sales are not to basketball players.'' The Air Jordan has been the best selling basketball shoe atNikesince 1985, when the company signed the pro, according toNikespokeswoman Melinda Gable.  She says a new Air Jordan will be introduced in February that will be lighter in weight ''with a more dynamic, glove-like fit.'' In the new shoe, heavier leather has been cut away. So has some material from the outsole.  After Jan. 1,Nikewill introduce its Air Flight Mid, worn by Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls. Weighing only 14.3 ounces, the shoe has a specially constructed tongue.Nike'snew running shoe is the Air Huarache that, according to Gable, ''is so lightweight it's minimalistic.'' Made without a heel counter, the shoe features a back strapping system and sells for $110.  Cross-trainers, athletic shoes that are not sports-specific, have been popular for some time. The Sports Quarters' Nolan says he ''lives in''Nike'scross-trainers, with leather upper and air bags in the heel only.  But Gable issues a warning to those who use them for sports: ''Serious athletes should get a sports shoe.''GRAPHIC:Photo; PHOTO...Nike,Reebok, New Balance and Asics fill a crowded market with more models each year.",0.213524015667,0.528647701505,685 words,IN STEP: NEW MODELS OF ATHLETIC SHOES KEEP UP SALES,1991-12-05 00:00:00,647 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)

"The shoe salesman from North Carolina sat with his hands clasped and spoke nicely about his golf game, his two children and what a privilege it was to be there. His fellow salesman from the Ukraine smiled and agreed.In front of them sat more than 1000 representatives of the world's media. Flashes popped and television cameras recorded every nuance and every word. Selling shoes had never been easier.Mind you, these were not your average shoe salesmen. No squeezing small shoes on to smelly, blistering feet for these two. One of them, Michael Jordan, the man from North Carolina who now plies his trade in Chicago, earns more than $25million a year. Sergei Bubka, too, lives comfortably.&nbsp;These are the Olympics and another round of Shoe Wars has begun.Nike, Reebok and a host of other shoe companies are all in Barcelona flogging their merchandise and reminding everyone how many champions they have signed to their labels.It wasNike'sturn on the weekend to do the boasting and it used Jordan and world pole-vault record-holder Bubka to do it. A cinema in downtown Barcelona was booked for the event and 15minutes before the media conference began the place was packed.For 50minutes Jordan and Bubka answered questions, and when you left, you felt as though you had spent half a day at a convention of advertising agents.Nikesigns hung from platforms and, outside in the street, a red bus with an inflated shoe pumped out loud rock music. It was all tacky, contrived and, in the end, completely meaningless.&quot;I'm not here because of money,&quot; said Jordan, referring to playing in the Olympics. &quot;Nikedid not influence me (to come). I came strictly on my own intitiative.&quot; But what did he feel about the way sport has been commercialised, particularly since he was sitting on a stage wearing his sponsor's products and endorsing what a terrific bunch of blokes they were? &quot;Commercialism is a part of all professional sports,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a way of life.&quot; That was about as interesting as it got. The rest of the time was spent either listening to sycophantic questions about how wonderful it must be to be able to soar like a bird, or listening to dull replies, several of which sounded suspiciously as though they had been rehearsed for a few minutes outside.Of course, the media has no one but itself to blame. With Jordan's fame at such a peak around the world _ it is claimed he is the most recognisable sporting figure on the planet these days, usurping Muhammed Ali _ he has said the same things over and over until he has to click off and turn to autopilot. Yes, it's a privilege to play in the Games.Yes, I love playing golf. Yes, it's tough being me and not having a great deal of privacy.Yes, Michael Jordan has very little privacy. When the grindingly long NBA season is on, he spends most of his time confined to a hotel room, unable to walk the streets for fear of being mobbed. He cannot do the little things. No late evening stroll with an ice-cream. No popping into the pub for a few beers with the boys. He can't even go to a public toilet. At least there he has an advantage over the rest of us.The Dream Team has been criticised in Barcelona for not living in the Athlete's Village, preferring instead the security and comfort of a five-star hotel. They dropped in the other day, explained Jordan, but felt the atmosphere would not have been conducive to a good preparation for the basketball tournament. Being in the village would be the same as living outside in the glare of the public. Athletes would be asking for autographs and pictures, small-time officials would be hanging from their shirt-tails.So instead, Jordan lives on his own and occasionally drops into planned media conferences to flog his sponsor's products. Then he departs just as quickly to go back and hide inside the bubble that is his private life.

"THE latest volley in the sneaker wars will be fired tonight during the Grammy Awards show in commercials for British Knights athletic shoes that use an updated version of a classic insult.The $15 million campaign, created by the Deutsch agency, uses the theme &quot;Your mother wearsNike-- choose change,&quot; to warn young buyers that wearing sneakers from the older, more established market leader is &quot;un-cool.&quot;&nbsp;Donny Deutsch, the agency's executive vice president and creative director, said the company wanted to use a twist on &quot;Your mother wears combat boots&quot; to make the point that Reebok andNikewere no longer on the cutting edge.&quot;We want to be seen as the sneakers for rebellious young people,&quot; he added. &quot;Reebok andNikehave become so mainstream they're the sneaker of choice for little old ladies.&quot;To make that point, one commercial features a group ofNike-clad, gray-haired women gossiping as they lounge around a tennis court. The spot tells viewers to &quot;choose change,&quot; then shows a lineup of flashy British Knights shoes decorated with brightly colored stripes.Another ad tells young viewers that even though they inherited their parents' genes, they need not follow in mom and dad's footsteps, implying that the only &quot;hip&quot; sneakers are British Knights.&quot;From a technical standpoint, all of the shoes are basically the same,&quot; said Larry Schwartz, an executive vice president at British Knights, which are made by Jack Schwartz Shoes Inc., New York. &quot;We think we can stand out by being more fashion-oriented.&quot;Officials ofNikeInc. did not return calls yesterday seeking comment on the British Knights campaign.The potshots from British Knights are part of an increasingly aggressive battle being waged by sneaker makers. Earlier this year, Reebok International began a campaign that taunted the athletes Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson, well-known endorsers ofNikeInc. products.In one spot for the Reebok Pump sneaker, which has an inflatable sole that the wearer can adjust by squeezing a bulb in the shoe's tongue, Dominique Wilkins, the Atlanta Hawks basketball player, says, &quot;So Michael, my man, if you want to fly first class . . . pump up and air out,&quot; as he tosses away aNikeAir sneaker, which has an air-filled sole but is not adjustable.In addition, L. A. Gear Inc. has been running a commercial for its Catapult sneaker that uses the slogan &quot;Everything else is just hot air&quot; to take a shot at theNikeAir shoe.Advertising in the $5.5 billion sneaker category has become more aggressive as growth in the market has slowed and the industry's leaders have found it difficult to gain a technological edge.Spending on sneaker advertising has risen substantially. Last year, the top three companies --Nike,Reebok and L. A. Gear -- increased ad expenditures from an estimated $70 million in 1989 to about $115 million. Mr. Schwartz, whose company is ranked No. 7 in the industry, said that on average, sneaker companies spend from 5 percent to 7 percent of total retail sales on advertising.Part of the reason for the jump in spending is the hefty fees paid to well-known athletes like Mr. Jordan and Mr. Jackson, who get $5 million to $10 million for endorsements.The flood of sports celebrities in sneaker ads has drawn criticism from some agency executives who said the glut of personalities tended to cause confusion and made it hard for consumers to remember which sports stars wore what shoes.",0.0933469308469,0.407595182595,578 words,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;Campaign for British Knights to Escalate Sneaker Wars,1991-02-20 00:00:00,661 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The New York Times
"Michael Jordan wants to just do it inNikes. So do David Robinson, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone, all of them endorsers ofNike, the clothing/sporting goods manufacturer.But the USOC said Jordan and his Dream Team teammates will have to wear the Reebok-made USA team warmups to be in medal ceremonies.On Wednesday, Jordan said while he did sign a code of conduct agreement, he crossed out the section that requires athletes to wear the official team uniform.&nbsp;&quot;They [USOC] accepted it [when he mailed back]. I didn't get it back. They know my concerns. No one has come to me personally and said, 'You better have the Reebok uniform on when you step on the stand,' &quot; Jordan said.In a statement issued by the USOC, Executive Director Harvey W. Schiller said: &quot;The matter of the offical award warmup suit which is mandatory for all U.S. athletes at medal ceremonies is an official policy of the United States Olympic Committee and included in the code of conduct for all members of our delegation.&quot;This rule was approved by the Athletes' Advisory Council and all athletes on our teams are expected to abide by it and all other portions of the code.&quot;Steinbrenner Steps InGeorge Steinbrenner will take over medical school expenses for Olympic swimmer Ron Karnaugh, whose father died of a heart attack at the Opening Ceremonies.&quot;I'm going to do everything I can to help the young man,&quot; Steinbrenner, a vice president of the USOC, said Thursday.Steinbrenner was with U.S. officials and Karnaugh's mother when they woke up the swimmer early Sunday with the news his father had died.The family's trip to Barcelona was financed by neighbors in Maplewood, N.J. The death of Peter Karnaugh, a truck driver, left the family with nothing, Steinbrenner said.Steinbrenner said he talked with one of Karnaugh's sisters about the bills that would arrive after he enters University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark next month.Meanwhile, Karnaugh has received a letter of support from speed skater Dan Jansen, who endured a similar tragedy at the 1988 Winter Games.Jansen's sister, Jane Beres, died five hours before he skated in the 500-meter race at Calgary. He fell in that race and again after leading the 1,000-meter race later in the week.Don't Make a Case Out of ItInternational Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo Nebiolo called on other sporting federations to help combat the growing problem of athletes appealing to civil courts.American sprinter Butch Reynolds, suspended for two years after testing positive for drugs, won a U.S. Supreme Court injunction in June allowing him to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials.The IAAF decided to take no further action against Reynolds before the Olympics but the subject seems certain to come up at a council meeting after the Games end Aug. 9. At the moment Reynolds can compete starting Aug. 12.&quot;The problem of civil cases is becoming a real problem for sport in the world,&quot; Nebiolo told a news conference.&quot;In athletics it's not so important because we now have 202 countries affiliated and fortunately in the big majority of these countries we don't have cases of athletes appealing to the civil courts. But, in fact, it can happen. That example can be followed and this can create a certain chaos in our organizations.&quot;Straight ArrowAntonio Rebollo, the disabled archer whose blazing arrow lit the Olympic flame, said he had been shabbily treated by Games organizers who cast him aside after the Opening Ceremonies.In an interview with Spanish daily Diario 16, Rebollo said the organizing committee had been &quot;pretty inconsiderate.&quot;&quot;I know some people at the top of COOB were against using me.

"Say this for Deion Sanders: He is lending truth to advertising. In oneNikead, the cynic/comedian/chain smoker Denis Leary said of Sanders: &quot;He's out of control.&quot;Nike'scopywriters meant this as a compliment, a synonym for &quot;wacky&quot; or &quot;zany.&quot; But on Monday night against Dallas, Sanders wasn't wacky or zany. He was simply . . .Out of control.Watching Sanders that night was akin to watching a child throw a protracted fit. Clearly Sanders wasn't having one of his better games, but that wasn't the disconcerting part. (Goodness knows, we've all seen Falcons mess up before.) What was truly nettling was Sanders's apparent resolve to remain the absolute center of attention at every moment.&nbsp;An actor who overemotes is said to be chewing the scenery. On Monday night Sanders chewed so much scenery as to render the Georgia Dome an open-air facility. His actions suggested that if he wasn't allowed to make a spectacular play, the game just wasn't worth playing. Sorry. This is not how football, or any sport, works.For every lookaway pass Earvin Johnson made on the fast break, he made 20 of the mundane sort in the half-court offense. For every one of Jerry Rice's 100-plus touchdowns, he has caught five 10-yard outs. Breathtaking moments come as a function of fundamentals, not as a counterpoint. Even if the big moment never presents itself, a game can be won in several smaller moments.Every play isn't meant for highlight filmsOn Monday night, Sanders was too busy playing to the ABC cameras to worry about details. Let us recount the ways:In the second quarter, Troy Aikman hit Michael Irvin on a slant. Sanders, assigned to cover, missed the tackle. Irvin continued downfield. Custom calls for a man who misses a tackle to hop up and pursue. Instead Sanders, among the world's fastest humans, stayed on his knees for long seconds, his arms outstretched in disbelief.Later in the second quarter, Dallas kicked off to Sanders deep in the end zone. Sanders made no move to run the ball. Neither did he drop to a knee and down it. Instead he stood in the end zone, railing at the injustice of not being allowed to return this kick. Was he about to rail himself into a safety? No. Though screaming is not considered the universal symbol for a touchback, the nearest official finally granted Sanders one.In the third quarter, Sanders fumbled on a kickoff return. On the next play, Emmitt Smith broke a half-dozen tackles to score. Sanders arrived just in time to shove him through the end zone and under one of the Dome's walls. If it wasn't quite a cheap shot, neither was it a serious attempt to make a tackle. (Serious tacklers don't shove opponents into the end zone.) It was merely a petulant gesture.Speaking of petulance . . . Sanders returned to the Falcon sideline and smashed an aluminum bench. Naturally, ABC caught it all.In the fourth quarter, Dallas kicked off for the last time. Sanders fielded the ball on his 2 and took it into the end zone. This time he kneeled down, forgetting that a touchback cannot be granted if the ball is carried into the end zone. The official, acting properly, made no signal. Had a Cowboy tagged the kneeling Sanders, it would've been a safety. At the last moment, Sanders jumped up and ran out to the Falcons' 26.Hey, I admit it. Time was, Sanders's antics cracked me up. I still laugh when I think of him breaking up a pass against New England, then running in front of the Patriots' bench and thumping his chest. But he's no rookie anymore. He's a 25-year-old All-Pro. He's better than this.To date, Sanders has been lucky. None of his excesses has cost his team a game - yet. (The end zone lateral against Phoenix came close.) But he has to realize that every single play isn't meant for the highlight film, or the sneaker ad.

"Sneaker wearers are attracted to the colors of the shoes as much as to their touted technological advances, like air pumps and gel-filled heels.Athletic shoes can be matched to sports outfits and street clothes. And there seems to be a color -- or a combination of colors -- for every taste, now that companies likeNikeand Reebok are mixing colors in their athletic-shoe designs. Their choices are influenced by the fashion, surfing and ski industries.&nbsp;Basketball, running, cross-training and aerobics shoes are emerging in bright colors like &quot;kiwi&quot; and &quot;aruba blue.&quot; Tinker Hatfield, creative director ofNike,said &quot;women who take aerobics are generally interested in color because they want their sneakers to match their outfits.&quot; Other styles, like tennis and walking shoes, combine ecologically correct earth tones.Nike'scolors for spring range from gray, jade and teal to rust, olive and tan.

"There's a backlash against dieting and America's narcissistic obsession with thinness.Dieting and stick figures are out.Self-acceptance and shapeliness are in.Honest imperfection is being trumpeted by a new wave of experts who contend that dieting almost always fails and frequently causes eating disorders.&nbsp;EvenNike,the '80s purveyor of sports gear, is getting in on the attitude, with a series of advertisements reminding women they may not be goddesses, but the ground beneath them is still worthy of worship.&quot;We know the hype is that if you want a good life, you have to be thin,&quot; says Carole Shaw, publisher of Big Beautiful Women magazine. &quot;You're going to have a better life, you're going to have a better guy, you're going to have a better job. If we could only be what we're not.&quot;In real life, people of all sizes are having good and bad lives,&quot; she says. &quot;Being thin doesn't guarantee you a wonderful life.&quot;In 1990, the U.S. government loosened its dietary weight guidelines, except for men and women with health problems and a propensity to carry their bulk in their belly, which has higher health risks.&quot;The focus was to look at a healthy weight,&quot; says Jackie Haven, a nutritionist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. &quot;The number may not be flattering in terms of appearance. Some may think that they still are too heavy. . . . But in terms of their health, it may not make a difference.&quot;The about-face is being hailed as a breakthrough by weight-control experts emphasizing dieters' self-esteem over weight. The experts are attempting to teach individuals to use food for nutritional reasons rather than as a sedative or a pastime.&quot;I'm thrilled that finally people are recognizing what women have known forever: that diets don't work,&quot; says Carol M. Munter, a New York psychotherapist and co-author of &quot;Overcoming Overeating&quot; (Addison-Wesley, $ 15.34). &quot;People are finally beginning to take the evidence seriously and give up dieting.&quot;&quot;We get put on diets because we live in a culture that refuses to acknowledge that people come in different shapes and sizes,&quot; she says.At the University of Toronto, &quot;We spend most of our time helping these women realizing that they deserve to be respected,&quot; says Dr. Janet Polivy, a dieting researcher.Diets 'don't work'Experts are also trying to convince dieters, most of whom are women, to take their lives off hold. Many overweight people postpone job and social opportunities with the idea of losing weight.&quot;One woman who went through the program was waiting to apply for a job promotion until she lost 50 pounds,&quot; says Dr. Polivy, who pointed out to the woman that she had been at the job three years. The woman applied for the promotion and got it.The new approach is advocated for individuals just a few pounds away from their ideal figure as well as to obese people.Diets &quot;don't work any better for people who are 400 pounds than for people who are 20 pounds overweight,&quot; says Susan Wooley, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati who began studying obesity in 1969. &quot;We keep deluding ourselves.&quot;As a college student, 5-foot-6 Susan Copeland of Marietta was a trim 128 pounds. But through the years she gradually grew to her current 153 pounds.About 18 months ago, she tried dropping 10 pounds by using liquid diets and skipping an occasional meal. The weight stayed on, and the 34- year-old medical assistant stopped trying about six months ago.&quot;Since people tell me that I don't look that weight, that helps me deal with it better,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm just content right now. . . . My priority is to eat right and to exercise and to just be healthy.&quot;At 300 pounds, Judi Dandy of Stone Mountain used to peer into the mirror and see a fat, ugly, worthless woman. &quot;For so many years I had been down on myself simply because of my size,&quot; she says.She tried dieting but always regained the weight. &quot;After I gained the last 100 pounds back, I said, 'The hell with this.' &quot;The 48-year-old says she's become happier and more sociable and has begun eating more healthfully since she stopped dieting. Her weight stabilized at 275 pounds.While the new approach is welcomed by those who once struggled to be svelte, other experts say advising severely overweight individuals not to worry is foolhardy at best - and even dangerous.&quot;If you don't want to call it a diet, that's all right,&quot; says Dr. Reubin Andres, clinical director of the National Institute on Aging Gerontology Research Center. &quot;But you have to control food intake. . . . To just say, 'Be happy with your body,' I can't do that.&quot;The risk of being obeseSeverely overweight individuals run higher risks for developing diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and early death, Dr. Andres says. But he acknowledges, &quot;The big argument has to do with just what is the best range of weights.&quot;Nevertheless, anti-diet experts argue that two decades of clinical observation and psychological studies show diets contribute to obesity and eating disorders. They point out that about 95 percent of people who lose weight gain it back within five years, and that &quot;yo-yo dieting&quot; - the cycle of gaining, losing, then gaining weight again - is suspected of causing heart disease.&quot;There's nothing wrong with watching what you eat,&quot; says Ms. Dandy, founder of Southeast Super Singles, who with a friend recently opened the Refinery consignment shop for large women in Alpharetta. &quot;But when you become a fanatic and when society is so focused on the perfect bod, this is what's causing the problem.&quot;&quot;If there was any diet that worked, we would all go on one diet and that would be the end of it,&quot; says Ms. Shaw, who founded BBW 13 years ago. &quot;But there's 27,000 diets out there.&quot;Dieters are also more likely to binge, says Dr. Polivy, who has documented differences between chronic dieters and non-dieters.Because of this, Ms. Munter and her colleague Jane R. Hirschmann, who both counsel overweight women, eliminate any controls on the type of food clients can eat. Instead, they teach how to recognize hunger and avoid eating out of boredom, depression or anxiety.But Dr. Andres says high diet-failure statistics should not be used to dissuade obese individuals from dieting. &quot;It's a dismal prognosis,&quot; he says, &quot;but it would almost be like saying, 'Look, you have cancer, we have a drug, but it's only going to cure 5 percent of the people who take it. Do you want the drug or not?' &quot;But Ms. Dandy welcomes the new advice. &quot;At one time I hated myself, and now I love myself.&quot; Counseling and tips from BBW magazine helped convince her she had value.&quot;People treat me with respect, and I think it's because I respect myself more,&quot; she says. &quot;I dress in much more fashionable clothing. Before, it was like, 'What difference would it make? A fat lob is a fat lob.' &quot;GRAPHIC:photo: Judi Dandy (right) says she's happier since she gave up dieting.

"It appears that only Michael Jordan is at the center of the latest controversy over the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team's licensing rights. Agents for three other Olympians, two of them yesterday, said that their clients have not been notified of any requirement to comply with an agreement to surrender their likenesses for marketing purposes.NBA Properties, the league's marketing arm and the Olympic licensing agent for USA Basketball, had reportedly asked all Olympians to comply with an agreement under which NBA Properties would have the rights to sell apparel with their caricatures. If the players don't comply, they would be asked to resign from the team.&nbsp;Jordan met with his agent and attorney, ProServ's David Falk, in Annapolis yesterday to decide on a course of action.Meanwhile, Utah's John Stockton, according to USA Today, wrote USA Basketball and said he wanted to play, no matter the guidelines. Stockton is also a ProServ client, as is New York's Patrick Ewing.At issue, once again, is an exclusive agreement between several players -- including Jordan -- andNike, the shoe and apparel company. Under this agreement, the players have givenNikethe right to use their likenesses in the sale of apparel, including T-shirts. And several players have in the last month asked the league to stop using their likenesses in the sale of apparel.Kyle Rote, the agent for Olympian Scottie Pippen, a teammate of Jordan on the Chicago Bulls, said the rumor about an ultimatum from the league &quot;is not factually correct. Everyone is excited about being on the Olympic team and representing the country. . . . Michael is on a different level as far as marketing.&quot;&quot;The rest of us appear to be on the sidelines until further notice,&quot; another Olympian's agent said.But a league source did make contents of a March 3 letter from USA Basketball President Dave Gavitt toNikePresident Phil Knight available to The Washington Post. In this letter, Gavitt warned Knight that &quot;we reserve the right to replace any of the six [Nikerepresented] players on the Olympic team ifNikecontinues to provide resistance.&quot;Gavitt declined to comment on the substance of any allegations, saying, &quot;I view this whole episode, right now, as a non-story. We have 10 players [on the team] who are good players, and more important, good guys. We have acceptances from all of them and they'll honor them [the commitments]. The Olympic team is about playing for America. It's not about agents or agencies.&quot;Jordan wondered Tuesday if NBA Properties wouldn't make a profit from the sale of apparel while the players surrendered rights to do the same. NBA Properties is representing USA Basketball because USA is a nonprofit organization.He told reporters, &quot;If it's going to be the way they laid it out to be, then it's going to be tough to swallow -- accept their rules or send in your resignation. I'm saying, 'I'm not here to resign from the Olympics, and I'm not here to accept your guidelines.' &quot;There was no word last night on what course of action Falk and Jordan would take, with the Bulls in town to play the Washington Bullets tonight.

"BARCELONA, Sunday: The shoe salesman from Carolina sat with his hands clasped and spoke nicely about his golf game, his two children and what a privilege it was to be here. His fellow salesman from the Ukraine smiled and agreed.&nbsp;In front of them sat more than 1,000 representatives of the world's media. Flashes popped and television cameras recorded every look and every word. Selling shoes had never been easier.Mind you, these were not your average shoe salesmen. No squeezing small shoes on to smelly, blistering feet for these two. One of them, Michael Jordan, the man from Carolina who now plies his trade in Chicago, earns more than $25 million a year. Sergey Bubka, too, lives comfortably.These are the Olympics, and another round of Shoe Wars has begun.Nike, Reebok and a host of other shoe companies are all in Barcelona flogging their merchandise and reminding everyone how many champions they have signed to their labels.It wasNike'sturn to do the boasting on the weekend, and it used Jordan and world pole-vault record holder Bubka to do it. A cinema in downtown Barcelona was booked for the event, and 15 minutes before the conference began the place was packed.For 50 minutes Jordan and Bubka answered questions, and when you left you felt as though you had spent half a day at a convention of advertising agents.Nikesigns hung from platforms, and outside in the street a red bus with an inflated shoe pumped out loud rock music. It was all tacky, contrived, and in the end, virtually meaningless.&quot;I'm not here because of money,&quot; said Jordan, referring to competing in the Olympics.&quot;Nikedid not influence me - I came strictly on my own initiative.&quot;What did he feel about the way sport has been commercialised, particularly since he was sitting on a stage wearing his sponsor's products and endorsing what a terrific bunch they were?&quot;Commercialism is a part of all professional sports,&quot; he said.That was about as interesting as it got. The rest of the time was spent listening to sycophantic questions about how wonderful it must be to be able to soar like a bird, or dull replies, several of which sounded as though they had been rehearsed for a few minutes outside.The media has no-one but itself to blame. With Jordan's fame at a peak around the world - it is claimed he is the most recognisable sporting figure on the planet these days, usurping Muhammed Ali - he has said the same things over and over until he has to click off.The Dream Team has been criticised for not living in the Athletes' Village in Barcelona, preferring the security and comfort of a five-star hotel. They dropped in to the village the other day, explained Jordan, but felt the atmosphere would not have helped them prepare for the basketball tournament. It would be the same as living outside in the glare of the public. Athletes would be asking for autographs and pictures, he said, small-time officials would be hanging from their shirt-tails.So instead Jordan lives on his own and occasionally drops into a planned media conferences to flog his sponsor's products. Then he departs just as quickly to go back and hide inside the bubble which is his private life.

"Last time Reebok tried to sell its sneakers with fashion ads in 1989, the campaign went over like brown shoes with a tuxedo.Nike- hyping its sneakers for their performance - jumped past stumbling Reebok to become the nation's No. 1 athletic shoemaker.&nbsp;Now Reebok is trying fashion ads again to try to gain ground on archrivalNike- which has 30 percent of the U.S. market compared with Reebok's 26 percent.This time Reebok's campaign is smarter: It's for only one line, the &quot;classic&quot; soft leather aerobics shoe. And the fashion pitch is refashioned to seem more like a performance pitch.The target: the same people who bought the shoes in the mid-1980s.The estimated $ 5 million magazine campaign features thirtysomething men and women engaging in recreational activities - biking, touch football - but clearly taking it easy, and looking good in Reeboks.

"As the Summer Olympics draw to a close and nations around the world assess their stature in the medals table, the biggest winners emerging from this global extravaganza are not the athletes, their coaches or their governments, but their corporate sponsors.More than any other Olympic gathering in history, these Games have served as a glittering showcase for big business. Instead of praising parents or other inspirational role models behind their accomplishments, the athletes now regularly express gratitude and devotion to the corporate entities that pay them hefty endorsements.The emblems ofNikeor Reebok are as prominent as the national flag on many uniforms. Companies rather than national Olympic committees dictate the public appearances of athletes. The entire 900-member delegation of the former Soviet Union, attending the Games for the last time as the Unified Team, was underwritten by a $ 3.5 million grant from Smirnoff and adidas.&nbsp;&quot;They made it possible for us to be here,&quot; said Alexander Kozlovsky, vice president of the Russian Olympic Committee.Once viewed as a grim contest between rival political systems, the Olympics began turning into a global commercial fair with the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Instead of resorting to public funding, the Games were entirely financed by the private sector and turned a handsome profit of $ 230 million.&quot;The world is changing and we have to adapt to it,&quot; said Juan Antonio Samaranch, the monarchical chairman of the International Olympic Committee. &quot;The Games might have come to an end if we did not bring commercial sponsors into the Games because cities and countries no longer can afford to stage them alone. The taxpayers will not stand for it.&quot;The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe over the past three years removed the dichotomy of Cold War conflict from Olympic competition. In these Games, the Soviet athletes say they have been motivated to perform well chiefly by the need to attract corporate support in order to sustain their future athletic careers.For big business, marketing at the Olympics has become fierce competition. With more than 1 billion people watching the Games, the most desirable marketing goal for many companies is to see their brand name associated with the prestige and skills of the world's finest athletes. Country affiliation has dimmed.The ultimate high-stakes battle in these Games has pittedNikeagainst Reebok.Nikecommands the loyalties -- for a generous stipend -- of six members of the U.S. basketball team. For that reason, Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, two ofNike'smost highly compensated endorsers, adamantly refuse to be seen in the U.S. team's Reebok-designed warmup suits at the medals ceremony. They will be allowed to unzip the jacket to block public view of the Reebok logo.&quot;In 1984, we had triple the number of athletes today,&quot; Steve Miller,Nike'sdirector of sports marketing, said in an interview. &quot;But now you just can't afford to have them all. So we are trying to get the athletes who are best in their events who also have the best impact for us in the global market.&quot;When Mike Powell's hamstring was troubling him before the long jump competition, he missed a morning news conference called byNikeso he could get treatment. No problem. A call to gold-medal-winning triple jumper Mike Conley, who won his event the night before, quickly produced a substitute.Asked how he felt about appearing on such short notice, Conley said, &quot;When they call, I go.&quot;Nikehas grown into a $ 3.5 billion-a-year business. More than two-thirds of its annual revenue comes from sales in the United States, but in the future the foreign sector is expected to grow dramatically. Thinking ahead,Nikeis now feverishly competing to recruit the allegiance of top athletes in growing markets. It issued an occasional newsletter (titled Swoosh) on its athletes, something no national Olympic Committee, aside from the USOC, did. It issued a slick magazine -- Barcelona '92 -- featuring its athletes.In Africa,Nikehas signed up the Kenyan runners Richard Chelimo, William Mutwol and Yobes Ondieki. Noureddine Morceli, the Algerian 1,500-meter champion, is considered a key wedge into a youth-oriented North African market.For Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States,Nikehas invested a huge sum in Sergei Bubka, the Ukrainian world-record holder in the pole vault whose failure to win a medal in this year's Olympics could diminish his marketing appeal.Nikeis also looking toward China, whose 1.2 billion people may represent the biggest untapped market for high-class sporting goods in the world. Tong Li, the 110 hurdles star, has endorsedNike, and other top Chinese athletes may soon follow.Chelimo finished second in the men's 10,000 Monday night, then was awarded the gold medal on a judge's ruling of interference. On Tuesday the decision was reversed and Chelimo met the media to discuss it -- in a news conference set up byNike, not the IOC or the Kenyan delegation.Reebok has counteredNike'spush by signing up Olympic basketball coach Chuck Daly, U.S. runner Suzy Hamilton and German tennis star Michael Stich. Reebok's biggest promotional tie-in was sidetracked when Dan O'Brien (of the ubiquitous Dan and Dave commercials) failed to qualify for the U.S. decathlon team.Corporate officials acknowledge that the endorsements of gold-medal winners are no guarantee for commercial success. &quot;It's always a gamble because you never know what will click,&quot; said Miller.GRAPHIC:PHOTO, BASKETBALL STARS MICHAEL JORDAN (LEFT) AND CHARLES BARKLEY SPEAK FIRST FORNIKE.",0.0841784037559,0.342491874323,930 words,Corporations Bask In Reflected Glory;Business Benefactors Pervade Games,1992-08-08 00:00:00,716 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Washington Post
"Rob Strasser predicts the future of feet.Strasser and partner Peter Moore helped createNike'sAir Jordan andNikeAir lines. Now Strasser lives in Herzogenaurach, Germany, as a marketing vice president for adidas. Together with Moore, working in the pair's Portland, Ore., marketing firm, Strasser says he's working to change adidas' image as a ''famous-but-boring brand.''&nbsp;It's about time. Although Adi Dassler made his first gym shoe in 1920, adidas had a puny 4% share of the U.S. market last year - compared withNike's28% and Reebok's 21%.While those giants tweak each other with mild wisecracks in TV ads, Strasser helped create a new adidas Equipment brand that will be rolled out nationally by August with a back-to-basics pitch. One Equipment ad, for instance, says sports isn't about ''greed ... arrogance (or) fashion.''It's a pitch meant to attract baby boomers, many of whom are presumably becoming more sensible at the expense of their fashion sense. The shoemaker will rely on relatively low-key endorsers such as marathoner Grete Waitz. Laughs Strasser: ''The baby boomers are going to set the trends until the last one is dead.''Another underdog, Converse, is relying on a practical pitch: It has launched a new ad campaign with the tagline ''It's What's Inside that Counts''.But last night, adidas and Converse managed to score a conventional marketing coup in their uphill battle against the U.S. sneaker giants. Duke's basketball team wore adidas, Kansas wore Converse.CHEST MATCH: Sam Marion recalls it as ''a hell of an experience.''About 15 years ago, a player on a Little League team Marion managed was hit in the chest - and nearly died being rushed to the hospital.Marion didn't forget. After borrowing heavily, Marion's International Protective Athletic Safety Corp. of Fraser, Mich., developed a $ 70 kids' safety vest suitable for baseball and other sports.Marion's safety vest weighs 1.5 pounds and is made of compressed foam. They're available in about 50 stores so far.They're overdue. The Consumer Products Safety Commission reports 51 baseball-related deaths between 1974 and 1984, and at least 13 in 1989-90. Last Saturday, a 15-year-old New Hampshire hockey player died after being hit with a puck in the chest.Marion says he also has sold the Seattle Mariners on using his $ 80 adult safety jacket in practice.

"All members of the Dream Team will be there on the medal podium after all, apparently, if the Dream Team is fortunate enough to win medals.Another controversy has been resolved with the compromise that anyone (Michael Jordan) who has a personal corporate sponsor (Nike)who objects to the team sponsor's name (Reebok) showing on the standard-issue uniform (United States) has the right to obscure what he does not want to show (logo).&nbsp;&quot;However,&quot; Dave Gavitt, president of USA Basketball, said in a statement after meeting with United States Olympic Committee officials, &quot;in no instance will the uniforms be defaced or covered by any other material.&quot;So what does that mean?&quot;They can turn down their collars to cover the logo,&quot; a U.S.O.C. staffer said. &quot;But we can't say that.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party Out of BoundsThe athletes' village may appear at first glance to be a peaceful splash of high rises beside the sea but it is turning into party central. Today, a spokesman at the village said he was calling in police to begin patrols, in response to complaints about late-night noise.&quot;It's the only way to control the situation,&quot; said Armando Calvo, who reported complaints from some residents about athletes being loud and drunken. &quot;Sometimes they get into arguments with volunteers checking their credentials.&quot;El Mundo Deportivo, the Spanish sports daily, reports that the problem is largely centered on athletes who have already finished their competition. They play their music loud and return less than quietly from late parties.&quot;Maybe it's a mistake to give free housing; because of that, no one is leaving,&quot; said Li Gwang Sik, the North Korean bantamweight who defeated Serafim Todorov of Bulgaria on Monday to gain the boxing semifinals.But the boxer said he understood the urge to party. &quot;They can't make us live a monk life,&quot; he told the paper. &quot;We're free now.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;How About Dan and Robert?Reebok doesn't have Dan and Dave in the decathlon, but it has Dave and Robert. That's Robert Zmelik of Czechoslovakia, who is a long shot to medal in the event but is welcome on Reebok's team anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tale of the Tape, and Ice PacksThe supplies are going fast for the American athletes here. Ed Ryan, head trainer for United States Olympic Committee operations at the athletes village, says American athletes have already used up 3,500 rolls of tape, 5,000 ice packs and 4,000 bandages, not to mention 1,200 disposable electric stimulation pads for use with ultrasound equipment. Ryan said there was nothing abnormal in the numbers. &quot;We're finding dehydration is one of our biggest problems to date,&quot; he said. &quot;The heat and humidity are creating havoc for our athletes.&quot;&nbsp;Used Syringes Found in VillageUsed syringes -- possibly for injecting vitamins -- have been found in the rooms of some athletes staying in the Olympic village.&quot;It appears the athletes are doing the injections themselves,&quot; said Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International Olympic Committee medical commission. De Merode said that housekeepers have been complaining about finding the syringes in wastebaskets. &quot;I can't prejudge what they were used for,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be nothing. It could be an innocent product like vitamins.&quot;But I believe this is dangerous,&quot; he said. &quot;Athletes should be careful not to take any medication without consulting their medical doctor.&quot;Armando Calvo, director of the Olympic Village, said needles have been found &quot;on a general basis&quot; throughout the village, rather than in one area. He said the cleaning company had not specified the number of syringes.Jim Montgomery, head physician for the United States team, said it's not uncommon for athletes to take injections of vitamin B-12.&quot;I know for a fact that when countries came into the village, the Polyclinic ran out of B-12 and they had to get an extra supply,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone wanted some. A lot of our track and field guys have wanted shots.&quot;Montgomery said he doesn't hand out syringes or let the athletes administer the injections themselves.&quot;We have all our used syringes right here at the sports medicine center in the village,&quot; Montgomery said. &quot;We give the shots ourselves.&quot;(AP)",0.0971916024355,0.439932249322,704 words,BARCELONA: NOTEBOOK;Don't Like the Sponsor?

"This began as another pinata job upon the brow of Deion Sanders, who continues to dismay even when he takes his days off. Amazing. He can't make practice with the Falcons because he's having a foot inspected by a team of doctors but can still be profiling that night courtside - said foot not even wrapped - when the Hawks bring Shaquille O'Neal to town. (Fashion tip: Time, my man, to stash the Huntz Hall wardrobe.)Worse, on the day most of the Braves take an opportunity to thank the city for another wild ride, Sanders is indisposed, vogueing in some crosstown gym for anotherNikead. This borders on civic insult. Whatever was done this month to mythicize his athletic abilities, Sanders did residual damage to his local image simultaneously, the McCarver water business a dubious quinella with theNikeair circus.&nbsp;To appear publicly with the Braves would be a hint at contrition, never a Sanders long suit. Perhaps one day, the blessed athlete will realize his life is something more than one long punt return.But the deeper one considers the plight of Deion Sanders, one keeps bumping his head up against a shoe company with its tongs so deep into the back of America's No. 1 cornerback/outfielder.Nikehas grown proficient at this, for its tongs seem to reach everyone everywhere.Ross Perot tells the American electorate to Just Do It.

Who on earth butNikewas able to pit John Thompson against the Rev. Jesse Jackson? Kids kill kids and take their $ 170 sneakers. The company is now in a snit over Jordan's appearance in a Hanes underwear commercial, fretting over His Airness's impugned image, the same image that helped sell $ 200 million of Air Jordan gear last year alone.Alas. But if there is no altruism left in peddling athletic footwear - what happened to the singular promise of &quot;run faster, jump higher?&quot; - there surely is no accounting for howNikehandles its front men. The company was all too happy to provide the private jet for the Miami- Pittsburgh shuttle that puckered Sanders's relationship with Braves brass. And who scheduled Tuesday's ad shoot so who couldn't be where?In Sanders,Nikehas hooked a kid with a sublime weakness for money, and should anyone think Sanders can't keep this up, their $ 3 million deal is slashed 90 percent should Sanders stop splitting time between baseball and football. Though this leans toward indentured servitude, Sanders views the deal as the underpining to his portfolio, barking at reporters during the NLCS, &quot;I don't need no publicity. My contract withNikeis set.&quot;The Mourning after for CharlotteTell the Charlotte Hornets. Latest to roll off the Georgetown-Nikeassembly line, Alonzo Mourning was chosen second in the last draft by Charlotte, which is now attempting to sign the rookie who already has a $ 16 millionNikecontract in his pocket. Mourning demands a $ 2.6 million starting salary. The Hornets have but $ 1.96 million available under the salary cap. An Auerbachian nightmare, the rook has all the leverage.

"&nbsp;A clash between U.S. Customs Commissioner Carol B. Hallett and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., contributed to blocking Mrs. Hallett's bid to be the next transportation secretary, industry and administration sources said Thursday.Until Wednesday, when President Bush nominated Andrew H. Card for the post, Mrs. Hallett was considered the front-runner for it. But the Bush administration shifted gears after being notified by Sen. Packwood that he asn't happy with the choice, those sources said.&nbsp;&quot;He had concerns, and he communicated them to the White House,&quot; according to an administration source.Sources said Sen. Packwood and Mrs. Hallett crossed swords over the issue of fees assessed toNikeInc., the Oregon-based footwear manufacturer. In particular, sources said, Sen. Packwood asked Mrs. Hallett to reverse a 1991 agency ruling adverse toNike. Her refusal to do so led to an angry exchange between the two, sources said.&quot;She didn't bend to Packwood, and he became furious,&quot; said an industry executive close to Customs. The executive said the senator has often interceded onNike'sbehalf in disputes with Customs.Sen. Packwood sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, which is responsible for confirming Department of Transportation nominees.Sen. Packwood denied reports that he sent a letter to the president advising him not to nominate Ms. Hallett, but declined to answer other questions about her. &quot;I'm not going to stir up those waters now,&quot; he said.Customs officials were unavailable for comment.Grant Hanson, aNikelobbyist, said the company imports millions of pairs of shoes each year and inevitably runs into conflicts with Customs over various issues. &quot;I'm not sure if this was over a particular incident or if it might have been something brewing over a period of time,&quot; he said.The choice of Mr. Card, who is currently deputy White House chief of staff, is being seen by some as a victory for Drew Lewis, Union Pacific Corp. chairman. Mr. Lewis lobbied for Mr. Card to win the DOT post, and had supported an effort to make him president of the Association of American Railroads.It is unclear how much influence, if any, Mr. Lewis had in swaying President Bush. But he told securities analysts in New York Wednesday that Mr. Card's close ties to the president and his good working relationship with his predecessor, White House Chief of Staff Samuel K. Skinner, &quot;means that transportation remains on the front burner for the administration.&quot;",0.120773524721,0.422900053163,416 words,CLASH REPORTEDLY HURT HALLETT'S DOT DRIVE,1992-01-24 00:00:00,730 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Journal of Commerce
"&nbsp;Nikebroke off its sponsorship deal with Katrin Krabbe, the world sprint champion from Germany who's awaiting a four-year ban for failing a drug test. The sportswear company also abandoned a similar deal with Grit Breuer, Krabbe's teammate who also tested positive for a banned substance. &quot;Every contract includes a clause that athletes are forbidden from taking performance-enhancing substances,&quot; said aNikerepresentative. Krabbe, the 100- and 200-meter world champion, and Breuer, the world silver medalist at 400 meters, tested positive for Clenbuterol, a muscle-building substance. Krabbe, 22, in an interview published Wednesday by the Super Illu magazine, said the athletes did not know that Clenbuterol was on the list of banned drugs. &quot;I never consciously did anything that was forbidden,&quot; she told the magazine. &quot;I am sorry if many fans are now disappointed in me.&quot; Thomas Springstein, coach of the two athletes, has admitted giving the drug to the two sprinters and his contract withNikealso has been canceled.

"&nbsp;WHAT started as a quick cigarette outside a party ended up as a harrowing five-hour rape ordeal on a nearby council estate for a 17-year-old girl, detectives revealed today.Her fashionably-dressed young attacker raped her three times after she braved a group of would-be gatecrashers outside the party in Heath Road, Battersea, for a quiet smoke in the street.The attack lasted until dawn. Detectives today descibed it as particularly savage and said the girl was 'severely traumatised'.&nbsp;The rape took place nearly a month ago, but police have only now been persuaded to publicise the ordeal in the hope that possible witnesses will come forward.The girl was attacked shortly after 1.30am on Sunday 10 May. The rapist wore a pair of &pound;100NikeAirMax trainers and a gold ring with the wordNikeon his left hand.'We were told that this ring was quite unusual, and hoped that inquiries with the supplier might have led us to the attacker,' said acting Detective Segeant Mark Woolner, leading the investigation.'Unfortunately that lead didn't take us as far as we hoped, and we are now appealing for witnesses.'A spokesman added: 'There was a large group of would-be gatecrashers outside, and she walked down the street to avoid them and have a cigarette.'She was approached by a youth aged between 16 and 19 who struck up a conversation about how to get into the party. Then the girl turned and walked away, intending to go to a friend's house.'But the youth followed her towards Dansworth Road and as far as a council block, Sharp House, nearby.'She carried on, thinking he had walked away. Suddenly she felt cold metal against her neck, and behind her was the youth saying he had a knife.'There followed a harrowing ordeal, as the attacker dragged the girl first to the rear of the Hope pub - where he was disturbed by a barking dog - then to bushes outside nearby Shore House and then to a third-floor landing in Sharp House.'In all she was raped three times over five hours,' said the spokesman.'It was getting light by the time she was able to run away - but only after he had robbed her of just over &pound;1. All the time she was terrified to cry out, believing that she might be killed.'She said the rapist was about 5ft 7in tall, of proportionate build, dark skinned with conventionally-cut afro hair, gelled down.He was wearing a red, white and blue cotton scarf, heavy sky-blue tee-shirt, tan bomber jacket and faded baggy blue cord trousers.'This was an entirely opportunistic attack on a defenceless young girl, and there is a serious danger that this person might strike again,' said DS Woolner.'We would appeal to anyone who might have seen something, or who recognises him or his ring to contact us at Battersea on 071 350 1122.'",0.00427797135114,0.469125048393,880 words,Party girl held till dawn by designer gear rapist,1992-06-09 00:00:00,745 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Evening Standard (London)

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEATTLE (Reuter) - A Seattle-based oceanographer believes that 80,000Nikeshoes will help explain the mysteries of trans-Pacific migration, the spread of oil spills and where bodies lost at sea will wash ashore.The researcher, Curtis Ebbesmeyer, has been studying the path of the drifting sneakers and sport shoes to learn more about how ocean currents work.The shoes - with a retail value of about $2.5 million - were accidentally dumped at sea in the Pacific Ocean by a freighter nearly 18 months ago and around 2,000 have washed ashore on West Coast beaches from Oregon to British Columbia.&nbsp;&quot;He's had a lot of interest in theseNikes,where they fell in and where they drifted,&quot; said Shannon Flotre, a colleague at Evans-Hamilton Inc., a Seattle-area oceanography firm in which Ebbesmeyer is a co-owner and oceanographer.Ebbesmeyer, who was not available for comment on his study, is a specialist on Puget Sound who also has expertise in statistics of drifting objects and keeps records on drifting portions of shipwrecks, icebergs and other matter.The data may help explain migration and anthropology of Pacific Island peoples and is frequently used in oil spill research and even in locating bodies lost overboard.The May, 1990, accident created the largest single drop of man-made drift objects in the North Pacific, surpassing 20,000 drift bottles dumped in the Pacific during the 1950s by a Canadian government research project.Rich Hastings, transport manager at Beaverton, Ore.-basedNikeInc., said the cargo was bound for Seattle from Korea and apparently was lost about 600 miles due south of Anchorage, Alaska.&quot;We do have an air cushioning system - some of the shoes had compressed air, which helped them float,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;I'm glad it can be at least some benefit.

"PENTLAND, the British sports-goods firm, is set to negotiate a lucrative contractto arrange the to manufacture of Adidas sportswear products in the Far East following its move to buy a 20% stake in the German giant from Bernard Tapie.The deal could revitalise the fortunes of Adidas and enable it to catch up recover some of the ground that has been lost to its two American arch-rivals, Reebok andNike.Further, Paris financiers expect Pentland's Pounds 47m Adidas investment to lead to it taking control of Adidas next summer when Tapie faces his next financial crunch.&nbsp;In the meantime Pentland, famous for its role in which made its mark pushing Reebok to the top of the sports footwear league table, will focus its efforts on securing a lucrative sourcing contract in the Far East with Adidas.It hopes the contract will mirror the long-term deal with Reebok that played a key role in the footwear company's ''miracle turnround'' in the 1980s, when it caught up withNikeearning Pentland Pounds 6m profit last year.Adidas lost out in the cut-throat battle with Reebok andNikeas because it was slow to follow them into the Far East. Today 85% of the West German giant's shoes are made in the Far East but Pentland's expertise in this area should be able to cut costs further.For Pentland, whose brands include Pony and Speedo, the attraction is that net margins at Adidas are only one and a half percent 112% compared with 10% atNikeand Reebok. If they can sort out the Adidas sourcing, profits at Adidas could explode from the current Pounds 19m.Reebok's decision to terminate the sourcing contract with Pentland was a key factor that persuaded the British firm to sell part of its stake for Pounds 200m. Today with Reebok shares riding high at $32, Pentland may soon sell its remaining 13% stake, which is worth another Pounds 222m.The sourcing contract is the icing on the cake but Pentland does not hide its ambition to own Adidas.

Typically for modern Germany, however, the return of the goddess has provoked a profound argument about what she ought to symbolise. When she was locked away behind the wall staring eastwards down Unter den Linden at the decaying communist state, the triumphalism she once represented did not matter.&nbsp;In a united country, however,Nike'sreturn with Iron Cross and Prussian eagle on her staff, has created worries that she will give the wrong message to the world about German ambitions for the future. Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, has also run into criticism over his plan, announced yesterday, to attend the ceremony taking place in Potsdam on August 17, when the remains of Frederick the Great of Prussia are to be moved. Frau Herta Daubler-Gmelin, deputy chairman of the opposition Social Democrats complained that this would rouse mistrust in Germany's neighbours.Similar arguments are being roused by the statue ofNike. Two hundred years ago she was designed by Johann Schadow, court sculptor to King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, to represent Irene, the goddess of peace. Napoleon changed all that. When he arrived in the city fresh from his triumph at Jena in 1806 he liked the look of the statue and decided to pack it up and send it back to Paris as part of his booty. The goddess lived in exile for eight years until Field Marshall Blucher secured her release in 1814 after Napoleon's first defeat.She returned in triumph, not as Irene but asNike, complete with cross, oak leaves, and eagle. As such she presided over the victory parades of the Prussians, the German Empire and the Third Reich. In 1945, however, the gate and the statue were badly damaged in the battle for the city.Using the scrap and pictures as a model the East German government managed to copy and replace the statue in 1958 without the victory symbols, carefully describing her in the official guidebooks as ''the peace goddess''. Now Friedbert Pfluger, a Christian Democrat Bundestag member from the west German state of Lower Saxony, has started a protest movement about the symbols of victory on her staff.",0.016404040404,0.325002886003,456 words,Goddess returns in triumph,1991-07-16 00:00:00,768 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Times
"One of the most influential characters in basketball is a pudgy&nbsp;former high school coach who counts John Thompson and Jerry Tarkanian&nbsp;among his close friends.John Paul &quot;Sonny&quot; Vaccaro has been ranked one of the 100 most&nbsp;powerful people in sports by The Sporting News. He's No. 80, right behind&nbsp;Michael Jordan.Without question, Vaccaro, 52, is the greatest sneaker salesman in&nbsp;America. He isNike'sconduit to the big-name college coaches and marquee&nbsp;programs such as Georgetown and Syracuse, signing coaches to six-figure&nbsp;contracts, some in the neighborhood of $ 200,000, for the favor of&nbsp;outfitting their teams inNikegear.&nbsp;Nikehosts summer camps showcasing the country's finest high school&nbsp;players, with all invitees approved by Vaccaro.Nikesponsors the Dapper&nbsp;Dan Roundball Classic, the granddaddy of national high school all-star&nbsp;games, which Vaccaro started in Pittsburgh in 1965.But critics have trashed Vaccaro for allegedly directing top&nbsp;recruits to college coaches under contract toNike. NCAA investigators,&nbsp;in general, are leery of his cozy relationship with both players and&nbsp;coaches.Now, in the wake of the NBA draft, Vaccaro is under attack from&nbsp;agents who claim he is cutting into their business. Vaccaro, although not&nbsp;involved in contract negotiations, has a hand in the marketing of several&nbsp;first-round picks - including Billy Owens, Dikembe Mutombo and Stacey&nbsp;Augmon, and he is negotiating with Larry Johnson, the No. 1 pick in the&nbsp;draft.All of the draft picks played at college programs under contract to&nbsp;Nike.&quot;Everything is an angle,&quot; said agent Ron Grinker, who represents&nbsp;Danny Manning, the first pick in the 1988 draft. &quot;I deal with him for&nbsp;players on shoe contracts . But now, I have to worry about him talking&nbsp;to players. He can go on any college campus where he has college coaches&nbsp;under contract and talk to every player. It's a scenario that is not very&nbsp;tasteful to me.&quot;Charles Grantham, executive director of the NBA Players Association,&nbsp;said he has been assured by Vaccaro that he will not be involved in&nbsp;negotiating player contracts. The NBA players union has no jurisdiction&nbsp;over endorsements.Vaccaro andNikeofficials deny any potential conflict, saying his&nbsp;latest business venture is independent of the athletic wear company.&nbsp;Vaccaro describes himself as a consultant for DIC Marketing, a Burbank,&nbsp;Calif., firm that has secured agreements to represent the players.&quot;I am the conduit, the go-between,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;They approached&nbsp;me a year ago and said they wanted to get involved with athletes. They&nbsp;knew I've been around athletes all my life.&quot;Vaccaro said he screened agents for some of the players, further&nbsp;raising the ire of those who couldn't get interviews. He also negotiated&nbsp;deals for trading cards on behalf of several players - among them Augmon,&nbsp;Owens, Mutombo, Greg Anthony, Anderson Hunt and George Ackles.Several agents accused Vaccaro of directing Augmon, the Atlanta&nbsp;Hawks' top draft choice, and Owens to player representative Arn Tellem.&nbsp;Vaccaro and Tellem, however, deny they have a business relationship.&quot;A couple of the agents I've heard from believe Sonny locked them&nbsp;out of a chance to get these guys,&quot; said Fred Schreyer,Nike'sdirector&nbsp;of sports marketing. &quot;I don't believe that's the case. The few players he&nbsp;is advising are kids he has been close to for a long time.&quot;Magic Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, said the only way to get to Augmon&nbsp;was through Vaccaro. He never met the player.&quot;I've been with Sonny for five years and I trust him,&quot; said Augmon.&nbsp;&quot;He's theNikeguy and he's been around our program. I met him in high&nbsp;school at the Dapper Dan, and I've been keeping close to him because he&nbsp;lives in the L.A. area. We go out to dinner. I know his wife.&quot;By conservative estimates, Vaccaro has signed more than 60 major&nbsp;college coaches - among them Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech and Hugh&nbsp;Durham of Georgia - to contracts withNike, along with more than 25 of&nbsp;the country's most influential high school coaches.The money Vaccaro can put in coaches' pockets has elevated him to&nbsp;the position of power broker. In some instances, college coaches find&nbsp;themselves earning more in &quot;shoe money&quot; than is paid them by their&nbsp;respective universities.&quot;Sonny, by his reputation, is a controversial guy,&quot; said David Falk&nbsp;of ProServ. &quot;He's got lots of contacts and can bring something to the&nbsp;party. I don't think that's all bad, but I think it threatens a lot of&nbsp;people. They feel he may have an advantage through his contacts and may&nbsp;be able to do things for players they're not able to do.&quot;Publicly, Falk is reluctant to criticize Vaccaro's dealings.&nbsp;Thompson, the Georgetown coach, is friends of both, and several of his&nbsp;former players are represented by Falk. But even Vaccaro acknowledges&nbsp;that Falk is upset that while his agency is negotiating the contract for&nbsp;Mutombo, Georgetown's latest star, Vaccaro will be responsible for the&nbsp;marketing and endorsements.&quot;This is the first time ProServ has lost a player to a marketing&nbsp;situation,&quot; said Vaccaro, who previously tried his hand as a gambler and&nbsp;rock 'n' roll concert promoter. &quot;They sort of pride themselves on what&nbsp;they've done with Michael Jordan , so they're upset about Mutombo. It's&nbsp;the first time an outsider, so to speak, has entered their domain.&quot;I don't do anything illegal with any of these kids. I know probably&nbsp;all the kids. If they're worried about that, they ought to pray I don't&nbsp;become an agent.&quot;",0.126370656371,0.503262548263,922 words,Nike'sVaccaro a conduit to coaches and players,1991-07-24 00:00:00,771 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution
"Barcelona - The crisis over the Dream Team's raiment for the inevitable gold medal ceremony was resolved Tuesday, avoiding a potentially embarrassing situation for the U.S. Olympic Team and further annoyance to the rest of the Olympic community.Some Dream Teamers - many of whom are under contract toNike- had indicated they would not participate in the ceremony if they had to comply with U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) demands that they wear the official U.S. uniform, which is produced byNike'sarchrival Reebok.But the compromise leaves the players free to hide the word &quot;Reebok,&quot; which appears on the right side of the uniform's jacket, simply by leaving it unzipped and thus folded over the name.&nbsp;&quot;In the event the men's basketball team wins a medal, all members will appear on the medal platform in the uniform issued by the U.S. Olympic Committee,&quot; David Gavitt, president of USA Basketball said after meeting with USOC officials. &quot;Some players may chose to wear the awards suit in a manner that does not reveal any commercial identification. However, in no instance will the uniform be defaced or covered by any other material.&quot;Despite the resolution, Olympic officials are becoming increasingly tired of the disruption the Dream Team has brought to the Games. &quot;There's a limit on being able to behave like a rock star,&quot; said Richard Pound, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) vice president.&quot;They're not coachable, approachable or governable by the USOC,&quot; Pound said. &quot;At the end of all this, there will be some careful assessment of this experience.&quot;He said it might be wise to limit the number of NBA players or eliminate them altogether.The controversy also has the sponsors wondering about whether the image of their products has been tarnished.&quot;This is starting to take away from the great basketball exhibition of the team and is a distraction for many of the other sports as well,&quot; said Reebok vice president John Boulter.He said such disputes &quot;could destroy some of the fabric of the Olympic spirit.&quot;The fabric has been strained frequently during the Barcelona Olympics, which has demonstrated the difficulty of mixing superstars with other Olympic athletes.While the other athletes stay in the Olympic Village, which was intended as a place for the world's youth to get to know one another, the stars have stayed in hotel suites.This annoys LeRoy Walker, head of the U.S. delegation and likely next president of the USOC. Walker also is the senior vice president for sport at the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.&quot;It's a way of saying 'I'm better than you. I don't have to deal with you peons,' &quot; Walker said.U.S. Olympic team members are becoming increasingly unhappy that some super-elite athletes don't want to bunk in with them, Walker said. &quot;They are all Olympians and they have all paid the price. They feel they should all be on the same level.&quot;Because of that resentment, Walker has begun a campaign to force all American athletes to reside together in future Games, even it it means going without NBA players.Borislav Stankovic, executive director of the international basketball federation, took exception to Walker's comments.&quot;I would ask [Walker] what will happen when [the U.S. sends] one other team that will not win a gold medal,&quot; Stankovic said. &quot;I think it will do tremendous damage if they [NBA players] will not come again.&quot;Nobody in international circles is complaining about the Dream Team,&quot; he said. &quot;The teams are losing by 30 or 40 points and they are happy.&quot;The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0919486215539,0.470864661654,602 words,"BARCELONA OLYMPICS BARCELONA SCENE Unzipped, folded collar solves uniform flap",1992-08-05 00:00:00,773 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

An ad campaign for the Air 180 running shoe was to  include commercials made by 12 internationally renowned directors  including Cronenberg, Frederico Fellini of Italy, Eiko of Japan, the  Laurenstein brothers of Germany and Jean-Luc Godard of France. Each  director shot a 15-second segment depicting one concept of the Air 180  shoe. It was to be shown Sunday during the Super Bowl.Cronenberg's spot, filmed in Toronto in October, is set on a distantplanet and features a creature that farms Air 180s growing in insect-likepods. In December, however,Nikepulled the plug on the international TVspots for the North American market, although they will be aired in Europeand Asia. Glenn Wakefield, the national advertising manager ofNikeCanada, said there were two main reasons for the change - differencesbetween North American and European and Asian tastes in advertising andknowledge ofNike. The ads were &quot;very European,&quot; he said. &quot;More of anartistic theme.&quot;Sources: Marketing, Advertising AgeSuper Bowl ratings, Part 2Pot luck in drug testingA booklet with the title, Drug Free, has been published by the U.S.  Olympic Committee to warn athletes about the dangers of drug use.

Marijuana is not considered a  performance-enhancing drug and it is not on the International Olympic  Committee's banned list. However, it is banned by the national governing  bodies of some sports and may be tested for at their request.Under the heading How long does marijuana stay in the system? the USOCreports, &quot;Breakdown products can show up in urine four to 10 days aftersmoking a single joint, and up to 36 days after chronic marijuana smokersquit.

"A SEVERE storm two years ago has given scientists unusual tools for studying the currents of the Pacific: shoes.The shoes went from mere footwear to tools of science on May 27, 1990, when the freighter Hansa Carrier ran into heavy weather en route from South Korea to the Pacific Northwest and 21 cargo containers were lost overboard. Five of the containers were filled with 80,000Nikeproducts, many of them buoyant.&nbsp;Since then, in a confirmation of theories about currents in the Northwest Pacific, thousands of sneakers, hiking boots, children's sandals and other shoes have been picked up along beaches from British Columbia to Oregon and as far into the mid-Pacific as Hawaii.That is just where oceanographers would have expected to find them. It has long been known that the Subarctic Current flows from the mid-Pacific northeast to the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, one fork sweeping south to California, then back toward Hawaii.Two oceanographers, Curtis C. Ebbesmeyer of Evans-Hamilton Inc., a physical oceanographic firm in Seattle, and W. James Ingraham Jr., with the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, began collecting reports on the seagoing shoes a year later, after reading an account in a Seattle newspaper of footwear washing up on beaches. They collected reports from local papers and befriended beachcombers along the coasts of Canada and the United States. Limiting their count to the most reliable finds, they determined that 1,300 shoes had been picked up, including as many as 250 from a single beach.The scientists described this impromptu experiment in the current issue of Eos, published by the American Geophysical Union.Despite months at sea, many of the shoes have been wearable after washing. The problem, though, is that the shoes were not tied together. So beachcombers have been holding &quot;swap meets&quot; to search for mates to their finds.The shoes confirm results of more conventional current-tracing efforts in which large numbers of bottles were dumped in the sea. During 1960-71, for example, 21,615 were released off Oregon by Oregon State University. In a 1956-59project, 33,869 were set adrift. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography released 148,384 off California and Mexico from 1955 to 1971.Assuming that many, but not all, shoes escaped from the containers, the recovery rate of 1.6 percent was not very different from that of 4,518 bottles released in one test near the same current but closer to the West Coast. Of these 2.8 percent were recovered.If other shoes survive -- and if theories about Pacific currents are correct -- &quot;some should arrive in Asia and Japan&quot; in a few years when, the researchers said, &quot;hopefully we will hear from our western Pacific colleagues.&quot;",0.0569444444444,0.345260989011,469 words,"If the Shoe Floats, Follow It",1992-09-22 00:00:00,777 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The New York Times

"&nbsp;NIKE, the American sportswear company, built a huge advertising campaign around four of its sponsored athletes at the Olympic Games. Posters appeared around the world telling the public how successfulNike'scompetitors would be. The trouble is that only one of the four was a winner at the Games.&nbsp;Michael Johnson, the firmest of favourites for the 200 metres, was displayed on advertising hoardings that congratulated the reader for doing something few athletes would be able to do at the Games: passing Johnson.  Unfortunately, the American was suffering from a viral complaint for the semi-final and four people passed him as he failed to make the final.Still, there was always Sergey Bubka, from Ukraine. As Olympic and world champion and world record-holder, he was expected to soar to victory in the pole vault on Friday. The poster proclaimed: ''Spanish air traffic control has been notified''. Bubka failed with his two opening vaults at 5.70 metres, then tried 5.75 and missed that. He was out of the competition without a clearance.Well, at least Nourredine Morceli, the world champion from Algeria, would saveNike'sface by winning the 1,500 metres on Saturday in the commanding fashion with which he secured the world title last year.

"For the past 18 months, a Japanese armada has been sailing silently across the Pacific. Now, these secret invaders have begun to infiltrate the shores of the United States. It sounds like a sinister attempt to redress the outcome of World War II. In fact, the explanation for the invasion is pedestrian, quite literally, for the flotilla is made up of 40,000Niketraining shoes that have been slowly bobbing around the Pacific Ocean since the spring of 1990.&nbsp;News that these sartorial requisites have met a watery fate may dismay the youth of the West. However, it has brought joy to Oregon's beachcombers, who have been making a fortune reselling the trainers which, bizarrely, have survived their briny immersion with surprising resilience.Odder still, the data provided by plotting theNikearmada's progress has allowed oceanographers to test several complex theories about the detailed mechanics of Pacific currents. &quot;It has been a real bonus to our work,&quot; said James Ingraham of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service.This strange story began on May 17, 1990, when a storm struck the freighter Hansa Carrier, which was en route from Korea to the U.S. The ship survived, but its shipment ofNikeswas washed overboard. Not a sole was saved.The incident was forgotten until November that year, whenNiketrainers began appearing along the shores of Oregon. Large hiking boots, high-top trainers and loafers began to bob landwards, at first in ones and twos, eventually in the thousands. To the incredulity of locals, the beaches were swamped with multicolored trainers.Within weeks, this well-heeled landing army had created a thriving new local economy. Beachcombers held swap-meets where they exchanged right and left shoes, which they then resold in pairs.&quot;I got my pair for $ 20,&quot; said Ingraham. &quot;That's about a quarter of the price I would have paid in a store. Admittedly, they had spent a year sloshing about the Pacific, but after I'd worn them a couple of times they loosened up and are quite comfortable now.&quot;The fact that the shoes were still wearable after many months' battering by storms would suggestNikeproducts have a certain weather-resistance, a quality that could well be marketed. However, this has not been seized upon.Maybe not, but the longevity of the trainers has been a real boost for Ingraham who, with colleague Curtis Ebbesmeyer, began studying the shoes' peregrinations. They used the data to produce a lengthy paper for the Transactions of the American Geophysical Union.They report that many of the shoes appeared farther south than would be expected for flotsam borne by the tropical currents that head northward to Alaska.Now, as the currents have swept back out to sea from Oregon, already some of the shoes have appeared on the shores of Hawaii.&quot;The next stop is Japan,&quot; Ingraham said. &quot;After that, they will start on their second circle of the Pacific Ocean.&quot;",0.0894136166863,0.323442214351,492 words,Footwear flotsam carries clues about ocean's flow;Nike'ssole survivors hit the beaches,1992-11-11 00:00:00,802 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)"

"Q: Has all that has happened to you thus far this season - the book criticizing you (Jordan Rules), the licensing controversies and other things, made this year less fun than it might have been?A: It's like a soap opera. Stay tuned for the next development. Playing basketball is fun. It's less fun off the court, though. That's been the big difference of this year and past years. I've been able to escape it all and just go out and play, but once I step off the court, there are a lot of questions I have to deal with - the book, greediness and different accusations. I just have to be truthful and stand up and answer the questions. You can't beat around the bush and say no comment, because that keeps it going.&nbsp;Q: Why did you agree to play in the Olympics in the first place?A: I wasn't really playing for financial reasons and I wasn't looking for any more endorsements. I was only playing because I wanted to hang out with the guys for the summer and be a part of history. Had I known it was going to be a headache like this from the merchandising and licensing stuff, I never would have committed to play.Q: With the agreement betweenNikeand NBA Properties, your likeness can't be used on apparel not sold byNike, and Nikecannot use the Olympics or its symbol on items. The That almost makes you a man without a country, doesn't it?A: I represent a country, but I can't be sold by one.Q: What do you think of Charles Barkley (the outspoken forward of the Philadelphia 76ers)?A: There is always some value in what he says. Who can tell him to shut up? Nobody. He's going to say what he wants. Some people like it, some don't. There's a lot of truth in what he says, but with that truth there is always some doubt of the other stuff that's in there. Either the language or the racism that he adds to his different comments makes it difficult for most people to fully understand, but we as basketball players, and some blacks, understand what he is saying.Q: What is the real story as to why you and Isiah Thomas don't seem to get along?A: The problem has always been he plays for a team I don't like and I play for a team he doesn't like. I've never had a real problem with him. I just don't know him that well and he doesn't know me. There was some competitive jealousy when I first came into the league. Magic Johnson was a part of that, but I was able to spend time with him and and we got past that. There just hasn't been the opportunity for me and Isiah to spend time away from the rivalry.Q: Who is your toughest competition in getting back to the NBA Finals?A: I don't care what anybody says, you can't look past Detroit. They scare you. They have the experience and the same nucleus that won the back-to- backs.Q: With Larry Bird and Magic Johnson at or near the end of their careers, how do you like being designated as the next ambassador for the NBA?A: I think everybody is kind of force-feeding me. I'm a part of the league and I want to uphold the NBA's way, but I think other players have to help out, too. The only guy I know who carried the label of ambassador by himself for a time was Dr. J.Q: How do most teams defense you?A: Everyone knows that driving is my strong point and the weakest part of my game is my jump shot. So most teams try to take away the drive, but when I'm knocking down my jump shot, they usually just try to double-team me.Q: Is Scottie Pippen the best player you ever played with?A: In my eight years in the NBA, yeah. In some ways it's like looking at a mirror. He doesn't want to play at just one end of the floor, either, and you don't find that every day at this level.

"&nbsp;Michael Jordan, a 28-year-old basketball player with the Chicago Bulls, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he does things that make you gasp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player ever to grace the court. Columnist George Will has suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-denomination dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, Jordan has had to play in a Bulls team that collapsed when the going got tough and in the National Basketball Association's play-offs, thegoing gets very tough indeed.  This year, however, the Bulls are playing the Los Angeles Lakers for the championship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is dominated by blacks. Since to play professional basketball at all you need great discipline, and to play it at Jordan's level you need extraordinary flair and imagination, it is hardly surprising that the great search for &quot;role models&quot; for black children should have fastened on the Bulls' star. Since Jordan is intelligent and articulate, notable for good sportsmanship and devoted to charitable work (though without ever seeming cloyingly goody-goody about it), he is an obvious choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a catch two catches, actually. The first is Jordan's association withNike,America's leading maker of sneakers. Jordan has been endorsingNikeproducts since 1984: the Air Jordan shoe isNike'sbest-selling line. He is not alone; other black heroes like filmmaker Spike Lee and John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown University, also endorseNikeproducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with that? According to Jesse Jackson, black America's most popular politician and a basketball fan, a lot.Nike,he argues, is promoting an &quot;ethos of mindless materialism&quot; by encouraging black children to buy sneakers (the latest Air Jordan costs $ 125) that they cannot afford. That sounds like killjoyism taken to the limit, but Jackson has a point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if inner-city children buy just one pair of sneakers; the pressure from the street is to keep up with the latest fashions. Some youngsters own as many as 50 pairs of sneakers; one 14-year-old boy told the Washington Post he spent $ 2,000 a year on shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not need to be a genius to work out one of the most likely ways in which some inner-city youngsters come by such sums: It is by selling drugs. Some drug dealers use sneakers as a way of recruiting youngsters to their gangs; some gangs identify themselves by the sneakers they wear, or accept stolen sneakers as payment for drugs. There have even been incidents where people&nbsp;&nbsp;R have been murdered for their high-fashion basketball shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike,to be fair, makes sure that its role-model endorsers like Jordan appear in advertisements warning kids off drugs and encouraging them to stay in school. But Jackson is entitled to wonder whether those messages are as strong as the ones coming from the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger catch is in the very idea of role models. Behind the search for role models lies the assumption that only great people such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X or Jordan himself are worthy of emulation. When those idols are found to have feet of clay andeveryone who draws breath does the pain of disenchantment can be profound.&nbsp;Jordan himself knows the pressure that role-modelling puts on him: &quot;I'm not a perfect person,&quot; he has said. He agrees with Charles Barkley, another NBA star, that the most useful role models for childrenare not heroes like himself but their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another drawback to role models. The majority of children have no chance of fame on the basketball court, or anywhere else. The veneration of sportsmen and women subtly denigrates more mundane but realistic goals like getting a steady job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What blacks need is not superstars but economic opportunity; and, as two recent sets of studies by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute have shown (as if the point needed laboring), anyone who thinks that they have such opportunity in the same measure as whites is deluding himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this should be taken as an excuse to denigrate Jordan's talent. But it is a shame that America's obsession with sports means that his kind of talent is celebrated more than that of other men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his city prepared for the NBA finals, Chicago magazine ran an article on Cyrus Colter, who in his long life has been one of Chicago's leading black lawyers, academics and public servants, and who, when most men would have put on the slippers, took to writing award-winning novels, short stories and poems. His has been an extraordinary tale; it is probably known to fewer than 1 percent of the young blacks who worship Michael Jordan.1991 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

Post a notice on the Olympic bulletin board. &quot;Leroy Burrell Press Conference.&quot; Burrell is only the former world-record holder and a gold medal threat in the 100-meter dash.Of course, the sports media forgoes the competition and heads en masse to the posh Hotel Avenida Palace. They're hot to quiz Burrell on the controversy surrounding the selection of the 400-meter relay team.And they will, but only after picking up Asics's thick press kit, complete with color brochures and Asics Corp.'s annual report. It's the newfangled Olympic news conference. Trot out superstar athletes, offer up some food and drink and the media will come. The media gets a few good quotes, and you get your prominently displayed company logo in every photo that goes out across the international wire services.Here in Barcelona, the ever-competitive athletic shoe companies have got this marketing ploy down.Mizuno pulled them in Friday with Carl Lewis. While Mizuno's chairman passed his new featherweight jumping shoe through the sweaty press corps imprisoned in an amphitheater at Poble Espanol on Montjuic last week, Lewis fed them bits about his devastating failure to make the 400-meter relay team.Nikeshowed not one, but two feature-length commercials in the Palacio Balana Cinema beforeNikesports marketing director Steve Miller paraded out &quot;The Sultans of Suspension&quot; - Michael Jordan and Sergei Bubka - to the sounds of James Browns's &quot;Gravity.&quot; &quot;Air Jordan&quot; meeting &quot;Aeroflot,&quot; quipped emcee Ahmad Rashad.In addition to individual contracts with spokestars such as Jordan and Bubka, industry leaderNikecompensates the U.S. track and field team to the tune of $ 1 million a year to wear its gear.Asics's ambassador Burrell - as a member of the U.S. track and field team - also wearsNikeuniforms, but he made it clear he wears Asics shoes.All these sponsorships are a bit confusing for the consumer.Japanese shoemaker Asics is the official shoe of the Barcelona Games - it supplied some 90,000 pairs to the Olympic volunteers, torch runners and organizing committee staff.Nikeis the official shoe of the U.S. track team; but Reebok is an official sponsor of the entire U.S. Olympic team, and is supplying the official award ceremony uniforms.So try to picture this: Burrell wins the 100-meter in his Asics. He pulls on his Reebok suit over hisNikeuniform and listens to the National anthem wearing all three brands.Seems it's getting a bit confusing for the media, too.",0.03911335578,0.451571268238,492 words,BARCELONA OLYMPICS BARCELONA SCENE Media turnout a shoo-in with Olympians as bait,1992-07-30 00:00:00,815 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

"PHILADELPHIA - Sales ofNikeInc.'s new cross-training athletic shoe&nbsp;went from zero in 1987 to an estimated $ 400 million this year, and Bo and&nbsp;everybody else know one big reason why.In addition to selling a lot of shoes, the advertising campaign&nbsp;featuring athlete Bo Jackson firmly established the small ad shop of&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy as undoubtedly the hottest agency in Portland, Ore.Now Wieden &amp; Kennedy has taken on another challenge, that of trying&nbsp;to get Subaru of America out of reverse. As a result of its landing the&nbsp;high-profile, high-billing account, Wieden &amp; Kennedy is opening a&nbsp;Philadelphia branch, which, by itself, will rank as one of the city's&nbsp;largest agencies.&nbsp;The first Subaru ads by Wieden &amp; Kennedy are to appear around Labor&nbsp;Day. Both the car company and the agency are mum on the content, but&nbsp;Subaru's director of advertising, Mark Dunn, promises that &quot;they're&nbsp;definitely something completely different&quot; from other auto ads.The campaign already is something different in one respect.&nbsp;Virtually all automotive advertising has been done by big Madison Avenue-&nbsp;based agencies. Nine-year-old Wieden &amp; Kennedy, by contrast, had never&nbsp;had a nationwide client until it won the account ofNike, based in&nbsp;Beaverton, Ore.; Bo knows' brought attentionThe overwhelming success of the &quot;Bo knows&quot; ads brought prosperity&nbsp;and rapid growth to Wieden &amp; Kennedy. For several years, the agency had&nbsp;all it could handle just keeping up with its star account.But when Subaru went looking for a new agency about three months&nbsp;ago, Wieden &amp; Kennedy felt it was ready for another big account. And&nbsp;Subaru, suffering from losses and shrinking market share, was ready to&nbsp;try something fresh.Subaru of America, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., took off in the 1970s&nbsp;with what was then a unique product, an inexpensive four-wheel-drive&nbsp;passenger car. With Subaru all the way was its New York ad agency,&nbsp;Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver.But Subaru went into a skid in the mid-'80s. Other carmakers brought&nbsp;out and elaborated on four-wheel-drive models, and they had other models&nbsp;and better-established corporate identities to lure customers.Subaru of America began suffering losses and shrinking sales, and,&nbsp;last fall, the parent carmaker back in Japan, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.,&nbsp;took matters into its own hands. It bought the Subaru of America stock&nbsp;that had been publicly held and began direct operation of the subsidiary.; Wanted to be major accountOn April 11, Subaru put its advertising account &quot;into review,&quot;&nbsp;meaning it was up for grabs. Subaru was looking for some specific traits&nbsp;in its agency, said spokesman Richard Marshall.&quot;We wanted to be a major account but not their sole account,&quot; he&nbsp;said. Nor did Subaru want to be one of many sizable accounts held by an&nbsp;agency.The strategy was to find an agency big enough to have the resources&nbsp;to service a national account but small enough that Subaru would command&nbsp;management's undivided attention.A consultant helped narrow the list to a half-dozen candidates. One&nbsp;by one, they trooped to a meeting room in the Hyatt Cherry Hill to make a&nbsp;presentation for about nine top-ranking Subaru executives.David Luhr led Wieden &amp; Kennedy's four-hour presentation. Although&nbsp;he can't discuss the creative concepts he pitched, he says that the&nbsp;presentation was built around the idea that &quot;Subaru always has had a&nbsp;distinct personality. It was not a Honda, not a Toyota; it was always&nbsp;styled a little differently.&quot;; Basic, reliable, but dullSubaru has always been thought of as a car that was &quot;basic, Spartan,&nbsp;durable and reliable, but not very pretty to look at,&quot; says Mr. Marshall&nbsp;of Subaru.Indeed, that is the theme of Levine, Huntley's last work for Subaru,&nbsp;the &quot;Never Die&quot; commercials that depict latter-day, upscale Subaru&nbsp;drivers discomfited to run across battered but hard-working old Subarus&nbsp;that look as if they are being driven by Okies escaping the Dust Bowl.The ads clearly say that Subaru wants a new image. It now falls to&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy to determine what that image will be.The market for compact and subcompact cars is extremely competitive,&nbsp;with literally dozens of similarly priced and equipped contenders.In that kind of market, &quot;advertising can really make a difference,&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Luhr says, so Wieden &amp; Kennedy can rightly claim credit if Subaru's&nbsp;fortunes begin to turn around. By the same token, Subaru has placed a&nbsp;great chunk of its fate in the agency's hands.Wieden &amp; Kennedy promised Subaru that it would open a branch near&nbsp;Cherry Hill to service the account.; Philadelphia office plannedBid the middle of July, Mr. Luhr also plans to staff an office of&nbsp;about 40. Enough people will be brought in from Portland to assure that&nbsp;the new office really is a Wieden &amp; Kennedy site, but the majority are&nbsp;expected to be new hires.The Philadelphia office will be a branch, but one that could grow as&nbsp;large as its home office. The Portland office has about 120 employees and&nbsp;handles $ 250 million in annual billings.The Subaru account alone will have 40 employees and up to $ 70&nbsp;million in billings. In Philadelphia, where relatively few agencies&nbsp;handle national accounts, few shops have billings of more than $ 100&nbsp;million from all sources.Mr. Luhr says the Philadelphia office eventually will look for other&nbsp;accounts, but for about a year or so, it will handle only Subaru.&quot;This is a huge account for us, and we're going to get comfortable&nbsp;with it first,&quot; he says.Larry Fish writes for Knight-Ridder Newspapers.",0.0635975352772,0.406753402847,929 words,Little agency creating ads for Subaru; Firm gained fame for Bo knows' campaign,1991-07-19 00:00:00,819 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

"&nbsp;PITTSBURGH - Deion Sanders, who might well be the Atlanta Braves' 25th man now, will play football Sunday in Miami for the Atlanta Falcons.  Sanders was to leave after Saturday's fourth game of the National League Championship Series on a private plane apparently sponsored byNike,for whom he does commercials. Sanders is paid $1 million byNikeif he plays both sports and $100,000 if he plays just one.  Additionally, he would forfeit $118,000 in football salary if he did not show up Sunday in Miami. That represents 1/17 of his $2 million salary.Nikeis said to be planning a commercial around Sanders' two-sports-in-one-day adventure. Sanders is expected back here Sunday night for the fifth game of the playoffs.  Braves general manager John Schuerholz said he would not have placed Sanders, who's called ''Prime Time,'' on his 25-man playoff roster if he had known he was going to try to play both sports.  ''If he gets banged up and can't play, it puts us at a disadvantage,'' Schuerholz said.  Manager Bobby Cox of the Braves said, ''I thought we had him exclusively through the playoffs and the World Series, and that's not fact.'' Braves President Stan Kasten said: ''We have been informed he will play football. There's nothing else to say. Everything else will wait for another time.'' Sanders, on why he no longer is talking to the Atlanta media, or most everybody else, said: ''They had a privilege.&nbsp;They abused the privilege.  They lost the privilege.'' Bob Walk, Sunday's starter for the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 5, made 19 starts, completing one durin g the season. He was 6-6 with a 3.38 earned-run average when starting. Walk may be remembered as the pitcher who started the first game of the 1980 World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies against the Kansas City Royals.  ''I don't think back then I realized what was happening,'' Walk said. ''I think I realize now what's at stake. It means a little bit more to me now than it did then.  ''My goal is to go out and hopefully throw six or seven innings, and when I leave the game hope my team has a chance to win.'' Walk is the only National League pitcher with at least 10 decisions a year to have a winning record in each of the last six seasons. He is also the only remaining player from manager Jim Leyland's first team, which lost 98 games in 1986.  ''The past few years I've pretty much gone wherever (Leyland) wants me to go,'' Walk said. ''When I went into his office yesterday and he told me, of course, I was surprised. I think he said, 'You're starting Game 5.' And I said, 'Starting?' '' Walk, 35, has had almost constant groin injuries the last few years. ''I don't feel I'll ever go out there again and not have an ache or pain somewhere,'' he said.  Against Atlanta, Walk is 5-9 in his career. ''They are probably one of the teams that have given me more trouble than anyone else,'' Walk said. ''I had success against a couple of guys who I won't mention - I don't want to jinx myself.'' One of them probably is Dave Justice, who is one for eight against Walk.  Otis Nixon is three for 15. However, the Braves are batting .303 overall against Walk.  While Braves catcher Greg Olson, a 1991 World Series notable who has ankle and leg injuries, entertains media as he supports himself on crutches, backup Damon Berryhill wonders why he was shortchanged.  ''I thought it was a joke,'' said Berryhill, a former Cub. ''It was like Greg had played all the games and I hadn't at all. I think he was seven games ahead of me.'' Unlike Olson, Berryhill prefers the shadows. 'Greg is a politician and I'm not one for the spotlight,'' Berryhill said.  Atlanta second baseman Mark Lemke, who has a .226 major-league career average, had 16 hits in his last 32 postseason at-bats before Saturday's game.  Braves lefthander Steve Avery, who will start the fifth game for Atlanta, has beaten the Pirates three times in succession in the last two playoff series. He has given up just four earned runs, all in the second game this year, in 22 2/3 innings.  ''Any time you have confidence against a team, it makes it easier to go out against them,'' Avery said. ''I don't know how much they think about it when I'm out there - if they're pressing a little bit to get to me early. I don't know what the reason is they haven't had much success against me, but it's an advantage for me.''",0.000446428571429,0.312351190476,728 words,'PRIME TIME' WILL WORK OVERTIME SUNDAY,1992-10-11 00:00:00,823 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
"&nbsp;Memo to MICHAEL JORDAN: Decathlete DAVE JOHNSON, who is Mr. Reebok, says he will proudly wear theNike-sponsored U.S. track and field uniform with not a moment's thought to company loyalty and all the other Jordan-inspired malarkey. He will wear his Reebok warm-up, will strip to hisNikeuniform, and stand on the medal stand (he hopes) with his official Reebok suit.  ''The reason we're here is to represent our country, not our company,'' he told BOB KRAVITZ of the Rocky Mountain News. ''When you get here, company things need to be left at home.'' Let's review, for all the brand-name shoppers.Nikemakes the track uniforms for the U.S. team. Champion makes the basketball uniforms. The boxing uniforms are made by adidas. Forty sponsors are paying a collective $160 million to the U.S. Olympic Committee and each athlete gets about $3,000 worth of luggage, cosmetics, jewelry, chewing gum, diet soda, etc.  But apparently that's not enough for Jordan, who probably makes more per breath than that.  ''I feel very strongly about loyalty to my own company,'' he has said.  Says MIKE LITTWIN of the Baltimore Sun: ''I'm waiting for him to say he regrets he has but one life to give to his shoe company.'' And furthermore . . . Johnson summarily dismisses the idea that Jordan or SERGEI BUBKA could become great decathletes.  ''Take my word for it,'' Johnson said. ''I can come closer to dunking a basketball like Jordan than Jordan could to pole vaulting or throwing the javelin.''&nbsp;Wait'll promoters get wind of this. Coming soon! To an arena near you! The Battle of the World's Greatest Athletes (and shoe companies)!  Now you know: Gold, silver and bronze medals were not always the reward for finishing in the first three places at the Olympic Games. In the 1900 Paris Games, valuable pieces of art were presented instead.  For the U.S. Olympic team, one size obviously does not fit all.  Reebok says it produced 38,000 pieces of clothing in 12 sizes ranging from double extra-small for female gymnasts to size-6 extra large for MARK HENRY, the 367-pound weightlifter.  Henry may need a tuck in his tights. ''I've dropped about 4 pounds, you know, walkin' and scopin' out the local (Barcelona) scene,'' he said.  ''Ain't much food here I can call by name, but I'm hoping to get back up to 367 before my competition.'' QUOTE/UNQUOTE ''We're here for free, we've given up our summer.

"After more than 70 years in the sneaker business, Converse Inc. is pinning its future on five words.Caught flatfooted in the great sneaker war of the 80's, the company has been eating the dust raised byNike,Reebok and L.A. Gear for five years. Using glitzy, celebrity-studded commercials to push one new line of high-performance sneakers after another, the Big Three have grabbed two-thirds of the athletic shoe business while helping to triple its size, to $5.6 billion annually in the United States. Meanwhile, Converse, hobbled by a scattershot approach to marketing, has been stuck with a 2 percent share.&nbsp;Now the company is gambling $22 million on a new ad campaign built around the slogan, &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts.&quot; The campaign, which begins Thursday, is designed to highlight the company's long tradition of making solid, if unexciting, sneakers -- at a price lower than the Big Three.The campaign, which features basketball stars Larry Bird and Bernard King, is particularly important to Converse, which has recently been operating in the troubled shadow of its parent, Interco Inc. The St. Louis-based furniture and footwear company, weighed down with debt in fighting off a hostile takeover 1988 attempt, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.The Boston-based advertising agency that is producing the commercials, Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, has a lot riding on the campaign as well. The second-largest agency in New England after Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., IQ&amp;J has represented Converse for eight years and counts it as one of its most important national clients. Although IQ&amp;J largely escaped blame for past marketing failings -- Converse says a lack of direction on its own part was the chief villain -- the agency is under intense pressure to deliver the goods with the new campaign. Just last Friday, the point was underscored when Hill, Holiday lost its Reebok account.How Converse and IQ&amp;J worked together is a tale of creative chaos, tight deadlines and taut nerves. The three-month the effort tested the resources -- and the patience -- of client and agency both.The effort began in earnest last September. Gordon Tucker, Converse's fourth marketing director in as many years, had concluded a summer of research with a list of adjectives that encapsulated consumer and trade perceptions of the company's major products, which include Magic Johnson basketball shoes and Chuck Taylor All Stars.The company had been marketing its brands separately, diluting the impact of the Converse name. The adjectives -- confident, passionate, hard-working, tough, selfish and genuine -- were to be used as guidelines for pushing the Converse name itself, particularly with the key buying group, teen-agers.IQ&amp;J assigned two creative teams to the project to compete in coming up with the campaign, a traditional industry practice. The teams were a study in contrasts.One paired Don Pogany, a copywriter who recently left the agency, with Peter Favat, an art director. Both men wear faded blue jeans to work; Mr. Favat accents his with cowboy boots and a small gold earring. They had made ads before for Converse, marked by fast-paced editing and clever punch lines.The second team, new to the Converse account, consisted of Mike Sheehan, in the copywriter slot, and Robert Rich as the art director, both of whom are more conservative in dress and taste. They favor a simple, direct approach in their ads.While some agencies devise campaigns on their own and present finished ideas to clients, IQ&amp;J executives prefer to hold a series of sessions in which they show their work in progress. At these, the &quot;tissue meetings,&quot; concepts are explored through drawings on tissue paper.&quot;Involving the client in the creative process means there are no surprises,&quot; said Bruce Kelley, IQ&amp;J's president.The first meeting was scheduled for Nov. 13. Mr. Tucker wanted a finished campaign idea by the end of that month, in time for Converse's annual sales meeting on Dec. 2.The two creative teams plowed through newspapers, magazines and books looking for sports images. They devised three potential campaigns, tried to eliminate one but finally decided to present all three.The morning of the first tissue meeting was cold even by Massachusetts standards. About a dozen executives met in a cramped conference room at Converse headquarters in North Reading, Mass., about 20 miles north of Boston. The atmosphere was casual. IQ&amp;J's executive creative director, Christine Chamberlin, explained the ground rules: a first tissue meeting was meant to be a broad review, a place to discard concepts the client didn't like.The agency opened with &quot;Worn in the USA,&quot; which everyone agreed was the wildest but weakest idea. Mr. Favat turned on a boom box and danced around the room in flawless imitation of a team mascot at a half-time show. The campaign, he said, would depict fans of a high school football team readying themselves for the game. Mr. Tucker laughed, but it was clear he didn't take the approach seriously.Then came a campaign built around a school locker room. One ad closed with a voice reminiscing, &quot;The moments are temporary but some things are permanent. Converse -- some things never wear out.&quot;To present the third concept, &quot;The Original,&quot; Mr. Sheehan also took his audience inside a school locker room. A coach tossed boxes of Converse sneakers at his players. &quot;We play as a team, we dress as a team,&quot; he tells them. The tagline: &quot;Converse -- The Original.&quot;Mr. Tucker asked the agency people which approach they preferred and Mr. Kelley pushed hard for &quot;The Original.&quot;&quot;It shows there is us and there is them,&quot; Mr. Kelley said, explaining that it set Converse apart from other brands with its &quot;pre-emptive statement&quot; that it was the original sneaker. Mr. Tucker was unconvinced, arguing that such a distinction had little meaning outside the industry. But he liked the idea of associating Converse with the timeless moments and youthful exuberance of sports. &quot;Sports teach kids about values,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That image fits us.&quot;The four members of the creative teams smiled politely like small children chastised by their mothers.The second tissue meeting was scheduled at IQ&amp;J's offices for 5:30 P.M. on Nov. 20, two days before Thanksgiving. The meeting started about an hour late because the agency people simply couldn't agree on what to present. Some thought Mr. Tucker's suggestion of associating sports with values was hokey. Some felt Converse needed to outdo the stylized approach of other sneaker companies. Some refused to give up on &quot;The Original.&quot;Mr. Kelley tried to start the meeting off on a positive note by introducing an idea for a new Magic Johnson billboard. Mr. Tucker hated it. The agency then tried to salvage &quot;The Original&quot; theme. Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Rich had discovered that several Larry Birds were listed in local phone books. They envisioned ads asking &quot;What is an original?&quot; in which these noncelebrities would discuss their feelings about sports. But the consensus was that the idea closely resembled Reebok's unsuccessful &quot;UBU&quot; (you-be-you) campaign from a couple of years earlier.Ms. Chamberlin addressed Mr. Tucker's values issue head-on with an idea entitled &quot;Stand for Something.&quot; She offered examples of coaches lecturing athletes on the sins of being late to practice and letting the team down. Mr. Tucker politely suggested it was too preachy.After four hours, Mr. Tucker was frustrated. The agency had presented a jumble of ideas. He liked the regular guy approach and was still attached to looking inside the minds of young athletes and examining their feelings about sports. Ms. Chamberlin told her staff to enjoy Thanksgiving and come in over the weekend.But early on Monday, the 26th, Ms. Chamberlin told IQ&amp;J's chairman, Richard C. Garrison, that her staff was still at odds.Mr. Garrison drove to Converse's offices in an attempt to buy more time. Mr. Tucker refused. Mr. Garrison then vowed that by the time Mr. Tucker left Friday for his sales meeting in Miami, IQ&amp;J would have sold him a finished campaign.Mr. Garrison returned to IQ&amp;J and tersely told the Converse team they needed to stop bickering and find an answer.The next day, the group went back to its list of 300 taglines and finally saw what it had been looking for. &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts&quot; had been analyzed, re-analyzed and finally dumped shortly before the previous meeting. Now, it fit the bill. It addressed the values issue that Mr. Tucker insisted upon. And the word &quot;inside&quot; gave Converse an opportunity to sell specific product benefits of its shoes.Armed with the tagline, the creative teams dusted off the second version of &quot;The Original&quot; campaign, devising a number of ads featuring noncelebrities talking about sports. (The focus ultimately changed to celebrities discussing their lives.) The campaign's tone belonged to the Sheehan-Rich team. The proposed look -- including a reliance on fast-paced editing -- came from Mr. Pogany and Mr. Favat.Mr. Garrison called Mr. Tucker to say the agency had found the answer. Privately, he and Mr. Kelley kept their fingers crossed.Mr. Tucker arrived at IQ&amp;J at precisely 8 A.M. on Friday, and two hours later he bought the campaign. When he left, he found a limousine with champagne waiting at the curb, courtesy of Mr. Garrison, to take him to the airport.It was Mr. Tucker's turn to sell the campaign, to Converse's president, Gilbert Ford. On Saturday, Mr. Ford signed on. On Sunday, so did the sales force. Now, after nearly four months of production, the question is whether the public will sign on, too.&nbsp;MAKING IT -- OFF MAD. AVE.Richard C. Garrison, the chairman and chief executive of Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, is determined to hold onto the Converse account, which, after Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and T. J. Maxx, a national chain of discount apparel stores, is the biggest client at the Boston-based agency.Moreover, Mr. Garrison wants to use the new Converse campaign as a national showcase for IQ&amp;J.&quot;The creative element of the advertising is particularly powerful in the sneaker wars,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to deal with accounts that have high-quality brand names and high visibility as national players.&quot;Mr. Garrison's notion of national prominence does not include moving out of Boston, however. Although many regional agencies expand by opening offices in other cities, Mr. Garrison believes national accounts will come to him.He wants his firm to remain a single office focusing on large accounts in the Northeast corridor and linking up with international agency networks at his clients' request. He dubs IQ&amp;J a mini-network because it provides a range of communications services -- public relations, design and direct response -- in addition to advertising.IQ&amp;J's turbulent recent history makes Mr. Garrison leery of rapid expansion. In 1986, Quinn &amp; Johnson/BBDO, a small Boston subsidiary of the large New York agency, BBDO Inc., bought 80-year-old Ingalls Associates to create Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson. But then BBDO merged with two other mega-agencies, Doyle Dane Bernbach of New York and Needham Harper Worldwide of Chicago, to form the Omnicom Group, which had $8.4 billion in billings last year.The 42-year-old Mr. Garrison, who had become president of the combined IQ&amp;J, quickly discovered he was a very small fish in a huge pond. So in February 1989, he and four partners borrowed $4.5 million to purchase IQ&amp;J. The five felt that conflicts of interest with Omnicom accounts restricted the agency's growth. Since the firm became independent, its total billings have grown 14 percent, to $134 million last year.Freedom also allowed Mr. Garrison to infuse the agency with an entrepreneurial spirit. &quot;There's a lot of screaming and yelling and passion flowing in the halls,&quot; Mr. Garrison says with a mischievous grin. &quot;But we don't have that many jerks.&quot;GRAPHIC:Photos: Christine Chamberlin and Richard Garrison of Boston-based IQ&amp;J (Jim Bourg for The New York Times); Bernard King and Larry Bird star in the new IQ&amp;J campaign.

Even against the lower sides the expectations have been not only to win comfortably, but also to do it with flair.&nbsp;South's annual clashes against sister club Sydney Olympic have also been regarded as special and a means of proving which of the Greek backed clubs is more dominant in the competition.Sunday's clash between the two in Sydney has an added ingredient, according to South striker Kimon Taliadoros.&quot;Every game South Melbourne plays is a big game, but personally, I have been looking forward to this one for some time,&quot; Taliadoros said yesterday.&quot;They knocked us out of the finals last season and this is more of a revenge game for me. It was that way when we met them at home earlier this season, but I believe we still owe them.&quot; Taliadoros celebrated his return to the senior side after a seven-week absence by scoring two goals in the 7-3 win over Wollongong Mac last Sunday.His effort earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award for round 17.&quot;It is certainly the highest scoring game I've been involved in my senior career,&quot; he said.Taliadoros paid special credit to his striking partner Paul Trimboli for the goals.&quot;If you look into them, you'll find that Trimmers was involved in almost all the goals at some stage.He was an integral part of my two,&quot; he said.&quot;As is the case with most South Melbourne goals, they were the result of excellent teamwork. I was lucky to be the last man at the end of the line to apply the finishing touch.&quot; As the player of the week, Taliadoros receives a pair ofNikeAir runners valued at $280, as well as collecting votes towards the Golden Boot.The end of season winner of the award receives $2000 fromNike.Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot Award.Round 17.

"ALAN DAVIDSON'S return to international soccer may well be in jeopardy with his decision to postpone indefinitely the operation he needs to repair knee ligaments.Davidson was told by Socceroo doctor Siri Kanangara to book in for the operation, but the utility has delayed it for several weeks to help out Melbourne Croatia. He has now decided to postpone surgery until the end of the season.&nbsp;&quot;I've put it on hold and will get it done when I can (after the season),&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;We have had a lot of injuries and suspensions and I agreed to delay it.&quot;The club knows I could break down any time or, providing I'm lucky, I could go right through.&quot;Davidson's operation will rule him out for up to five weeks and, if he was to have it immediately after the league campaign, it would virtually rule him out of international commitments.He may delay it further but at this stage he doesn't want to think that far ahead.

"ON THE OTHER FOOT: Deion Sanders's endorsement contract withNikeathletic shoes would drop sharply in value if the two-sport star decided to play only baseball or football, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.The three-year deal signed this year gives Sanders about $ 1 million a year, provided he remains in both sports, according to an attorney who reviewed the deal for the newspaper.Nikespokeswoman Lisa DeNeffe declined to comment on terms of the contract. Sanders's agent, Eugene Parker, could not be reached, the newspaper reported yesterday.&nbsp;If Sanders, who is an outfielder for the Braves and a cornerback for the Falcons, decided to play just one sport, the contract's value would drop to about $ 100,000, the Journal-Constitution said.Nikealso has an option to drop the contract completely if Sanders chooses one sport.Sanders appeared headed toward making a decision to play either baseball or football exclusively.

"&nbsp;An impaired driver left paralysed by a highway crash after drinking beer supplied with dinner at his workplace has been barred from suing his employer for damages.Michael Jacobsen, 19, claimedNikeCanada Ltd. breached its duty of care to him, an inexperienced drinker, when it provided him with alcohol as an incentive or reward to work overtime.He saidNike, having allowed him to continue to consume alcohol after he became intoxicated, knew or ought to have known he was unable to drive his vehicle due to fatigue and alcohol consumption.&nbsp;Lawyers forNike, citing a legal precedent that says no one can benefit from his or her own wrongdoing, argued in a pre-trial motion that Jacobsen's action should not be allowed to proceed.B.C. Supreme Court Justice Richard Blair agreed, saying: &quot;The conduct of the plaintiff (Jacobsen) is the type which society is trying to eradicate.&quot;The dangers of driving while impaired are great and devastating, particularly to the innocent users of the highway who have the misfortune to become involved in traffic accidents caused by persons who are driving while impaired.&quot;For this court to allow the plaintiff's claim to proceed would be to condone the actions of the plaintiff, who was clearly defying the law in driving while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol.&quot;The court was told Jacobsen worked a 16-hour day on Sept. 6, 1991, part of it at B.C. Place Stadium, where he and other employees erected a trade show display forNike.When he finished work, Jacobsen was supplied with a dinner consisting of fried chicken and salad. A choice of beverages, including beer and soft drinks, was available.Jacobsen consumed two bottles and four cans of beer supplied byNike.He then went with a co-worker to two nearby drinking establishments, where he drank another bottle of beer, part of a half pint of draft beer and a full pint of draft.Driving home alone to Port Moody on the Trans Canada Highway at about 2:15 a.m., Jacobsen lost control of his vehicle, swerved across the nearside lane and crashed into a ditch. He was rendered a quadriplegic.Expert evidence at the hearing indicated Jacobsen's blood-alcohol content at the time of the accident would have been between .17 and .20, substantially above the legal limit.Blair, upholding the legal precedent cited byNike, quoted an earlier judgment in which Justice Martin Taylor said: &quot;It would be manifestly unacceptable to fair-minded, or right-thinking, people that a court should lend assistance to a plaintiff who has defied the law.&quot;",0.0333333333333,0.444444444444,432 words,Paralysed driver barred from suing,1992-11-28 00:00:00,839 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)
"The Greenville (S.C.) Spinners haven't played a game - or even finalized their roster.But the Global Basketball Association team has a novel idea for sports teams looking for new revenues: Instead of just giving career counseling and motivational speeches to your players, make a business out of providing them to your fans.By the time the GBA - a new pro league with 11 U.S. franchises - tips off in November, the Spinners hope to have signed up a number of local companies for motivational seminars.&nbsp;They won't be your typical corporate outings. Figuring there's a growing demand for corporate seminars that help develop teamwork and concern for quality, the club will work with a local technical college to provide motivational speakers and career and family counselors. After daytime seminars, workers will attend a Spinners game.Spinners coach Joe Williams, who coached at Jacksonville, Furman and Florida State, says seminars will come with a range of options. Companies can opt to have their signs spread along the length of the court at the game that ends their motivational outing. Or let their key employee throw out the first ball at tipoff time.But companies shouldn't get their hopes up too much. Seminar prices vary and are negotiable. But the Spinners top price, for their ''Grand Slam Outing,'' is close to what New York Knicks coach Pat Riley gets for a motivational speech: $ 15,000.IT'S THE SHOES:Nikespent $ 178.8 million on advertising in 1990, says Advertising Age, which makes the shoemaker the USA's 58th-biggest advertiser.

"SPORTS shoe giantNikehas drawn up plans to shift up to US$ 150 million worth of production out of China if the US acts on its Section 301 mainland hit list.The multi-billion dollar group says it will be forced to raise the price of running and sports shoes by up to 15 per cent if the US refuses to back down on threats to double tariffs.&nbsp;Nikeinvestor relations director Mr Ron Parham said: &quot;We have put together very extensive contingency plans in the case of the sanctions being levied against China.&quot;We will shift products back to other bases. Every product built in China is also built in other countries, and it would take us only three to five months to fully transfer all our China volume into a variety of other countries.&quot;&nbsp;The US has imposed an October 10 deadline for the resolution of the acrimonious dispute over US access to the Chinese market.&nbsp;Nikehas already mounted an intensive lobbying campaign in Congress to avoid the punitive measures, which it claims will damage the industry as a whole.If no agreement is reached by midnight on October 10, the US will impose punitive tariffs of up to 100 per cent on up to $ 3.9 billion in annual Chinese exports to the US. China has said it has drawn up a list of its own covering a similar amount of US exports.The National Retail Federation has told the Office of the US Trade Representative in the current public hearings in Washington that punitive tariffs against Chinese imports would strike a &quot;severe blow to American consumers&quot; and could cripple some retailers as they head into the Christmas season.&nbsp;Nikecurrently produces some 20 per cent of its shoes in China, representing about $ 300 million in turnover for fiscal 1993, shared among seven factories on the mainland.Production vice-president Dave Taylor said: &quot;In the first six months of this year over 40 per cent of all shoes imported into the US came from China, so if the Section 301 hit list is enacted there is serious, serious damage to the US retail industry. It's a huge deal.&quot;The idea behind 301 is to make it impossible to do business, so it punishes the importing country.&quot;In Hongkong, a spokesman for Yue Yuen Holdings, one ofNike'smain suppliers of Chinese-made shoes, said the threats applied mainly to domestic US consumption and were of no great concern to the company.Yue Yuen executive director Steve Li I-nan said: &quot;They are trying to convince the authorities not to act. We will take note of it for reference but they are being forced to say things to influence people in the US not to take action.&quot;The US market accounted for about 69 per cent of Yue Yuen's turnover in the five months to February this year, but European sales had expanded strongly and were expected to increase as a proportion of total sales over the next few years, Mr Li said.He added thatNike, one of Yue Yuen's four biggest customers, realised &quot;China is the best place to make shoes&quot; on a cost basis.&nbsp;Nike'sMr Taylor agreed, saying China offered &quot;the lowest cost source; one of the best quality sources, and a huge labour pool&quot;.According to Mr Parham, shifting production out of China to other Southeast Asian Markets would add around 10 to 15 per cent to manufacturing costs.&quot;To some extent shoes will become more expensive if the levies are enacted by Congress. Unfortunately that hits the consumer,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Nikeand its competitors also face a squeeze from the other side of the Atlantic, with new EC quotas.Mr Taylor said the EC-imposed quotas - originally scheduled to take place this year but postponed as member countries failed to agree on a package - had already prompted the company to adopt contingency plans.&quot;We have lobbyists in Europe monitoring the whole thing for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We are using contingency plans right now, because some countries are not taking products in. France have got quotas, but we are working round them.&quot;It's a problem. We just need to know what the rules are to figure how we can work on them.&quot;Europe isNike'sbiggest market after the US.

"John Thompson, the renowned Georgetown University basketball coach, is good at what he does -- and that's not limited to coaching. He likes his players to be fine students as well as fine athletes, and in this and other ways he proves that he is a man of some values. One of them, unfortunately, is to sound like Adam Smith's parrot.Capitalism, capitalism, Thompson squawks when asked about the $ 200,000 or so he gets annually fromNikeshoes. In exchange, Thompson shoes his team inNikes. He makes public appearances for the firm. He acts as one of their spokesmen, and he tried, without success, to broker a deal betweenNikeand Jesse Jackson over minority hiring and other such matters. Even Big John Thompson doesn't win them all.&nbsp;If patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, then capitalism must run it a close second. It's often invoked as a lame excuse, an attempt to duck a moral argument by saying all ways of earning money are equal. But across town from Georgetown is the University of the District of Columbia. It's the city's public institution of higher learning, and many of its students are poor. On its basketball team is one Keith Goodie. He owns 56 pairs of sneakers.Goodie is to sneakers what Imelda Marcos was to pumps. In his addiction, he is in no way typical, but he is representative. He told The Post he doesn't know anyone who doesn't own at least 25 pairs. To this, people in the sneaker business would only shrug their shoulders in cynical acknowledgment: What else is new? They know that athletic shoes make a major fashion and status statement in the inner city. Lots of poor kids have dozen of pairs, and they are the shoes of preference for drug dealers.Jesse Jackson had his own differences withNike. But when it comes to sneakers in general, what he says makes sense. These shoes, selling for as much as $ 135 a pair, are symbolic of an urge to showboat. They are worn by kids whose pride, whose entire self-esteem, is on their feet or on their backs. They spend recklessly because they think they have no future, and they have no future because, among other reasons, they have little self-discipline. Jackson to his credit says so.It goes without saying that poor people have little money. But they often lack something else as well: a refusal to postpone gratification. Whether it's having a child when too young or squandering money on athletic shoes, this behavior is characteristic of the culture of poverty. So, too, in a way is basketball. It's a game of youth that promises an almost instant payoff for the extremely talented. But as a way out of poverty, it has the long odds of a lottery: just a handful win.Thompson and the other coaches who have contracts with shoe firms surely understand the lure of basketball and the impact famous coaches have. But instead of acknowledging that their endorsements only reinforce a destructive mentality, they proclaim a mindless allegiance to the free-market system. &quot;So all of a sudden it's a sin in this society for a person to be capitalistic?&quot; Thompson said. &quot;But as long as I live in America, that's exactly what I am going tobe.&quot;Trouble is, Thompson's role as a capitalist is in direct conflict with his role as a mentor to young black athletes and, since basketball is king, to young black males in general. When his team takes the court with everyone wearingNikes, not only do the people in the arena notice but so does everyone watching television. After all,Nikeis paying him big bucks expecting a big payoff. Here is the ultimate in false values: a team wearing a certain shoe so that the coach can make a buck.But what if Thompson allowed his players to wear any shoe they wanted? What if kids all over America could see that one sneaker is very little different from another and their obsession with name brands (at incredible profit margins) marks them as suckers? What if they gleaned the message that the shoes and their look didn't matter at all, but that performance was everything? Isn't that a lesson that transcends shoes?Of all that ails the black underclass, a weakness for expensive sneakers is hardly the most serious. But as Jesse Jackson knows, it is representative of a larger problem, one personified by a college student who squanders his money on shoes -- making rich people even richer and himself a bit poorer. In this regard, John Thompson and other basketball coaches offer nothing in the way of rebuke. In perhaps the most important respect, the coach is not coaching.",0.038135026738,0.494894745777,755 words,John Thompson'sNikeConnection,1991-03-14 00:00:00,853 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Washington Post

Bill Lord, Rick Kaplan and Dorrance Smith preceded him ...Bettag said an increased emphasis on investigative reporting can be expected. He said the program does so superbly during crises -- such as the Persian Gulf War -- that the trick will be to maintain that kind of momentum. &quot;I think I've just got to remind them once in a while of just how good they are&quot; ...His predecessor, Smith, departed for the White House in March. Bettag said the fact that &quot;Nightline&quot; continued to operate without a glitch and without an executive producer for the next two months was another sign of &quot;just how strong this program really is&quot; ...He will operate out of New York, where another 15-plus &quot;Nightline&quot; staffers work, at least for the time being.

According to BU President John Silber, Arledge's &quot;programming innovations have transformed broadcast news reporting. You have increased the range of news coverage, developed new kinds of news programming such as 'Nightline' and dramatically increased the size of the television news audience.

"The sporting goods industry resembles Dominique Wilkins's missed&nbsp;slam-dunk in this year's NBA All-Star game: There's still plenty of&nbsp;spring in its legs, but maybe not what there used to be.That was the message, in effect, that John D.

"&nbsp;ON WIMBLEDON'S elegant grass courts a grim multi-billion pound battle is being fought - but its takes a sharp eye to catch the action.Slogging it out are the mega-stars of the sporting world -Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Asics, Puma and LA Gear.Nikeis currently several sets ahead in the match for global market share. Wimbledon's cachet makes it the premier marketing event.&nbsp;The world sports shoe market is worth at least $ 18 billion (&pound;10 million) in sales at wholesale level and tennis is probably 10% of that. Apparel sells for getting on for $ 30 billion and anything specifically tennis is hard to split out.But the sports goods companies go for clothing because the brand names are easier to detect on TV screens.Shoes are where the big money is made, however. Top-of-the-technology shoes cost at least $ 180 (&pound;100) retail for those not lucky enough to be sponsored. Odds are those shoes left the factory gate in China, Taiwan or Indonesia for $ 18 - but there are lot of men in the middle including 10% for customs.The US buys most, at around $ 6 billion wholesale, followed by Europe's $ 3 billion. Of that Britain takes $ 0.6 billion.Rankings followed anxiously by the industry are those compiled by Pennsylvania-based John Horan's Sporting Goods Intelligence. He placesNikeas number one seed with $ 2.3 billion sales of footwear, followed by Reebok with $ 1.8 billion. In the USNikejumped from 28.6% to 29.8% in market share last year, while Reebok moved from 21.3% to 22.8%.Tough marketing programmes run by these two are, according to John Horan, 'knocking the daylights out of Adidas'. Its clout has been shrinking.Last year, says Horan, Adidas did well, gaining US market share, from 3.3% to 3.5% - although this was a slower rate of growth than the top two.  Sales are now $ 1.1 billion.This year Adidas, in the uncertain hands of French socialist millionaire Bernard Tapie, has been losing match points. With Tapie laden with debt, money for marketing seems to be missing.'That is why everyone is waiting for Pentland to take all of Adidas,' says Horan, referring to market speculation that Pentland is just waiting in wings to add dramatically to its 20% stake with a bid for Tapie's 55% shareholding.'That will really toughen the competition. At the moment it is all the smaller names that are benefiting from Adidas's struggles,' Horan adds.Coming up are Puma, Keds, Ellesse, Fila and K-Swiss. Slipping down the league of smaller companies are LA Gear, New Balance, Etonic, Converse and British Knights and Pony.But the scene has been changing rapidly this season.Armed with &pound;400 million from selling out of Reebok, Pentland boss Stephen Rubin has been able to pick and choose with whom he wants to do business.The new alliances to watch are those with LA Gear (with whom Pentland does the sourcing and a 6% stake), and Ellesse (for whom Pentland sources all footwear). At the cheaper end of the market Pentland owns the Pony brand.For the puntersNikehas fallen from $ 77 this year to $ 56 on a profit warning. Reebok, too, has just issued a warning.Pentland sold out at $ 26-5/8 - the price is now $ 22-5/8. It bought into LA Gear at $ 11, currently it is $ 13.Pentland itself is still moving ahead - on hopes of a bargain bid for Adidas.",0.00270446399479,0.36660149886,1000 words,&pound;10BN BATTLE OF THE SPORTS SHOE STARS;NIKESTILL LEADS THE FIELD BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHERS IN THE RUNNING AND THEY'RE HOT ON IT'S HEELS .SALLY WHITE GETS ON THE TRACKS OF THE FACTS,1992-06-24 00:00:00,863 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Evening Standard (London)
"&nbsp;MAJOR DENIES DECISIONBY UK TO BACK DELORSThe United Kingdom government has still not decided whether to back Jacques Delors for a second term as European Commission president, U.K. Prime Minister John Major said Tuesday.Mr. Major denied newspaper reports the government had made a tacit agreement that Mr. Delors should be reappointed despite fierce opposition from many Conservative members of Parliament.He confirmed that when the U.K. takes over the European Community's rotating presidency between July and December, it will promote an examination of the principle of &quot;subsidiarity&quot; - the idea that decisions in the EC should be made nationally or locally rather than at the EC center if this is more apt.&nbsp;&nbsp;CITIBANK BOMB THREATSFUEL CONCERN IN TAIWANTAIPEI, Taiwan - Police searched Citibank's four Taiwan branches Tuesday in the latest in a series of bombings or threats involving U.S. companies and possibly related to trade tension with Washington.Citibank's local headquarters received threatening telephone calls Saturday and again Monday, but a police search turned up nothing, a bank spokesman told The Journal of Commerce.A series of explosions in several McDonald's restaurants in Taipei killed one person and injured four in late April. The bombings and subsequent threats to Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets forced both restaurants to close for several days.The most recent threats may be related to anger over U.S. trade policy with Taiwan. Anti-American sentiment rose when the U.S. Trade Representative placed Taiwan on its priority watch list for inadequate protection of intellectual property rights.Washington removed Taiwan from the list last month after Taipei agreed to U.S. demands to increase protection.

"ALAN Davidson is the first player to argue about being selected as the Herald-SunNikeAir player-of-the-week.His performance when Melbourne Croatia fought back from a goal down to beat Wollongong Macedonia 2-1 at the weekend earned rave reviews from the media and he was the automatic choice for the weekly award.But the veteran Socceroo was reluctant to accept.&nbsp;&quot;I felt I worked hard, but the game was marred by a strong wind and didn't lend itself to outstanding performances,&quot; he said.&quot;It was my first outing in midfield, but it turned into a game for defences having to cope with long balls.

"If it were up to him, Boston's Reggie Lewis would wear Celtic-green suede basketball sneakers on the court instead of black.Then again, color is of little concern to the 6-7 swingman.&nbsp;''It's not the color of the shoe,'' says Lewis, who looks for comfort and fit, ''it's the individual that makes the shoe.''If that individual is Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, then wearing black on the court has ramifications beyond basketball. It becomes a fashion statement.Since Jordan and the Bulls started the trend three years ago in the playoffs, sales of black shoes have skyrocketed. Numerous college and high school teams wear them.All the major companies -Nike,Reebok, Converse and adidas - report major increases in sales of black sneakers. AtNike,black shoes account for 75% of sales; at Converse, 60%.''It's an all-time high,'' saysNike'sDusty Kidd.Thirty of Converse's 54 models are offered in black, says spokesman Mickey Bell.Black sneakers aren't limited to basketball. Even tennis, long stifled by ultraconservative dress codes, tolerates dark footwear on pros such as Andre Agassi.Manufacturers have gone to great lengths to make black sneakers, long considered clunky-looking in basketball, sleeker.''The thing that makes (today's black sneakers) look faster is the silhouette,'' says Kidd, adding that color accents and space-age designs make shoes appear ''more aggressive.''Says Kidd: ''With some guys, they're so quick that no color is going to make them look slow.''",0.0278918650794,0.453035714286,253 words,Black shoe sales lace up top spot,1992-01-09 00:00:00,870 of 998 DOCUMENTS,USA TODAY
"IN the heart of Chicago's Michigan Avenue shopping district, theNikeTown building looks as tranquil as the Saks Fifth Avenue store it once housed.Then you pass through the revolving doors. New Age music is playing, mixed with the tape-recorded clamor of playoff crowds. Banners hanging from the ceiling read: Performance, Technology, Innovation.&nbsp;And then, through a set of automated black doors (like any astronaut or aquanaut, one must enter this world gradually), you arrive in 68,000 square feet of museum exhibits, aquariums, video theaters and athletic photography. And half a basketball court.This, you have to remind yourself, is a shoe store.NikeInc., the Beaverton, Ore., sport-shoe concern, can well afford its audacity. With annual revenues of $3.4 billion last year, the company has made its name with celebrity endorsements and irreverent ad campaigns. Three years ago,Nikeexecutives decided to break from the company's history of modest retail outlets to gather all their wares under a single roof -- in effect, to jam every method of image enhancement into a box and see what happened.The first experiment was a small-scale store in Portland, Ore., which opened in November 1990. The Chicago store, more than three times its size, is the concept's real test. It opened on July 2.Walking along the manhole-dotted &quot;streets&quot; ofNikeTown Chicago, you soon get lost between big design concepts and impressive details. Everything you see bears the mark ofNike'scorporate mythology.There are the Greek-style friezes of athletes in action on the facade, and life-size plaster statues of mountain bikers are suspended from wires in the three-story atrium. There are door handles in the shape ofNike's&quot;swoosh&quot; logo and museumlike placards that tell the legend of Bill Bowerman, aNikefounder. One day in 1971, so the story goes, Mr. Bowerman, a University of Oregon track coach, got it into his head during breakfast to pour latex into a waffle iron and thus discovered the waffle-soled shoe.There's also the maple basketball court, where you can test sneakers (but not play ball) beneath a 35-foot picture of Michael Jordan and a quotation from William Blake.Scattered around the entire store, in fact, are &quot;inspiration boards&quot; bearing abstract messages: &quot;You get up in the morning, early. You think about your run. Anticipation is your first stretch. Then you go.&quot;On the store's 12th day of operation, though, no one seemed to be doing much reading. There were shinier objects to examine, notably the nine-screen video floor in the aquatic apparel section, where crowds gathered to gaze down at a film of sharks, drifting seaweed and sand washing over conch shells.&quot;I am not sure I understand,&quot; said a Norwegian tourist. &quot;Is this to be walked upon?&quot;A young salesman, Patrick Roach, stepped up to prove the floor's strength by holding an elderly woman's hand as she gingerly stepped onto the video sea. &quot;You get the best effect if you're on top of it,&quot; Mr. Roach said, picking his way around customers who were trying on sandals. &quot;It's really very safe.&quot;While tourists stopped to pose with the octopuses in the video underfoot, Mr. Roach typed a stock number into a sober black computer terminal. Next to it stood a wide clear-plastic tube flooded with emerald-green light. Two minutes later, he opened the door of the tube and found a pair of sandals.InNikeTown, you are never more than a few steps from these big tubes, which are actually miniature state-of-the-art elevator systems.. They run from every selling area to the stock area on the fourth floor, the functional heart ofNikeTown. There, burly men sprint between shelves of orange and black boxes, pluck out the required shoes and feed them into the system.&quot;If those tubes remind you of 'The Jetsons,' it's no coincidence,&quot; said Gordon Thompson 3d,Nike'sdesign director. &quot;The transport system is actually a modified Spacely Sprockets idea.&quot;Mr. Thompson's role in the project, he said, involved everything from devising floor layouts to color-coordinating the tropical fish in a 22-foot-long aquarium with the shoes that sit on the rack in front of it.&quot;My job is to be a sort of film director, and this store tells a story,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a mythology, but one for a range of consumers, people who are 7, 27 and 67. What we've done is taken one theme, athletics, and pulled it in every conceivable direction. I like to think it's part 1939 World's Fair and part theater. But I guess the bottom line is, it's a store.&quot;It's easy to lose sight of that fact. Still, to match the surfeit of design, there's a staggering amount of merchandise. There are all-condition jackets, Lycra shorts, beach shoes called aqua socks, running socks, trekking socks, cycling socks, aerobic socks, cross-training socks and every kind of sport shoe imaginable. Items are organized by sport so you can, for example, do all your tennis shopping in one feverish wave.And how much did this store costNike?Executives declined to discuss the subject, commonly joking that it cost &quot;more than Michael Jordan's championship ring,&quot; but one employee said the price tag was around $34 million.InNikeTown's plush video theater, a few dozen people clustered to watch an endless loop of footwear commercials. Two young executives danced in the back of the room to John Lennon's &quot;Instant Karma,&quot; but a Tulsa couple's eyes never left the screen.Four towheaded children sat in a row on the floor.

"&nbsp;Voters in the Meramec Valley School District will be asked on June 4 to increase the district's tax rate by 48 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation.  The money would be used for operating expenses and to pay for salary increases for teachers, said Superintendent Edward Hillhouse.&nbsp;The proposal needs a simple majority to pass. The district is mainly in eastern Franklin County, with small parts in St. Louis and Jefferson counties.  The district's tax rate last year was $2.23. If passed, the increase would add $45.60 to the school tax bill of the owner of a house worth $50,000.  Hillhouse said the increase is needed to hire two teachers at Coleman school and a part-time kindergarten teacher atNikeSchool.  The district also wants to install a computer lab at Robertsville School and to buy new reading series for pupils in kindergarten through third grade.  Hillhouse said the district is considering a bid of $69,000 for the series from Houghten and Mifflin Inc.  Some of the money would be used for teacher salary increases. Teachers will not be getting a raise in the next school year, Hillhouse said.  The district also wants to consider expanding counseling services, he said.  Hillhouse said the district's last operating tax increase occurred 17 years ago. In that time, voters have approved two bond issues, one seven years ago for $3 million and the other three years ago for $3.1 million. Hillhouse said that money went to build Truman School andNikeSchool and for renovations at existing schools.  Hillhouse said each school has been promoting the tax proposal.  ''Everybody I've talked to has said they're with us,'' Hillhouse said.

"Just like people, more companies are using physical fitness to stay in good shape.The growing trend toward the sponsorship of fitness-related events points to a healthy desire by Canadian companies to raise their profiles among conscious consumers.''The growth in sponsorship reflects a trend through the 1980s, when the public was becoming more aware of fitness,'' says Graham Fraser, owner of TriSport Promotions Inc. of Grimsby, Ont., a promoter of triathlon events across the country. ''Ten years ago, most of our sponsors wouldn't have talked to us. Now they like to sell the fact they're associated with a fitness-related event.''&nbsp;In some cases, boosting exposure through spectator or participant sports is a natural.Athletic-wear companies, such asNikeInc., have developed multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns featuring professional athletes like football and baseball star Bo Jackson and basketball player Michael Jordan to win over aspiring athletes across the continent.Regionally, smaller promotional events, such as community coaching clinics and local sporting events, bring the corporate message closer to consumers.''The big, international sponsorships are well known, but we try to bring to make the brand more personal by sponsoring local events, too,'' says Roy Agostino, promotions co-ordinator forNikeCanada Ltd.'s Eastern region.''This is the bread-and-butter of our business,'' says Murray Souter, vice-president of marketing at Toronto-based Reebok Canada, a division of Avrecan International Inc. ''It's much like automakers sponsoring pro car racing - we need to be involved.''For such companies, athletic sponsorships take on a practical quality. By providing top-flight athletes with their product, the shoe companies get wear-testing data and free expert design input in return.But for others, the connection isn't so apparent.In 1990, for example, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. spent more than $500,000 on sponsorship of a nationwide triathlon series in conjunction with Reebok, Toshiba and other sponsors, and plans to continue its association with the sport for another three years.COMMON THEMEMoncton-based Cavendish Farms sponsors a junior ski-racing program at selected resorts across the country; McKenzie Financial Corp. in Toronto does the same at Ontario resorts.And Crown Life Insurance Co. sponsors the Participaction Challenge, in which more than four million Canadians register 15 minutes of physical activity on a specified date each year.Emphasizing their commitment to local communities is a common theme among corporate sponsors.''As an insurance company, we like people to be well,'' says Barry Francis, assistant vice-president of corporate communications at Crown Life, which spends about $500,000 on the event annually. ''But it's also a great way to enhance the image of the company. Our representatives get a higher profile in the communities where they live and work.''While the public-relations aspect of promoting a healthy clientele can'tbe underestimated, few sponsors would deny that they're cashing in on the high-profile nature of sports. In most cases, decision-makers look for well-advertised events with high attendance figures to get the most bang for their buck.NOTHING IN STONEAnd when considering a fitness-related sponsorship, few firms will take the initiative and organize an event on their own. In most cases, the sport's national association, or a promotional company like TriSport, takes care of the organization, advertising, and promotion, while the company provides the funding.Though companies will often maintain an association with a particular event for several years, the value of their commitment is rarely written in stone, Fraser says. Given the current recession, therefore, some athletic events may see the level of sponsorship drop considerably over the next year.''One of the first things to go when times get tough is usually discretionary spending, and sponsorship often fits into that category,'' Fraser points out. ''Some companies may find it hard to justify spending a lot of money on sponsorship, but they'll still want the exposure. It'll be a tough time for anyone just getting into the game.''",0.141564854898,0.355831443689,718 words,FITNESS IMPROVES FIRMS' FIGURES: Sponsorship ties products to health,1991-01-25 00:00:00,886 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Financial Post (Toronto, Canada)"

"Up in Goat Park, the legend picks glass off the concrete, chides a grown man for urinating against the fence, listens solemnly to an invitation to come to the Columbia University gym tonight and pick up an award.&quot;What for?&quot;&nbsp;&quot;You're a legend,&quot; says an older man. &quot;We call it the Golden Hoops First Playground Legend Award.&quot;&quot;Who's the second?&quot;&quot;That's next year, be somebody else.&quot;The legend, Earl (the Goat) Manigault, sighs. He's 47 years old, broke and dying. He needs money for his tournament and a heart transplant for himself. He watches a covey of teen-age Michael Jordan clones, shaven heads, baggy shorts,Nikeshoes, pad onto his court.&quot;You should ask Michael for money,&quot; I say.&quot;Ask him to look at my tape, read my proposal and help me,&quot; says Manigault. His eyes poke into distant corners of his park. &quot;We're helping him, all these bald heads andNikes.Look at me.&quot; He points down at his whiteNikes.&quot;Was looking for Converse, but all's I could find around here size 13.&quot;&quot;So, you gonna be there?&quot; asks the Golden Hoops man.Manigault shrugs. A second team of Michael clones arrives to play the first. The courts, officially in the Happy Warrior Park, are off Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan, between 98th and 99th streets, nestled among apartment buildings packed with players. This has been Goat Park since the early 1970's, when Manigault began his youth tournaments, first hustling drug dealers for shirts, trophies and referees, later soliciting foundation grants.This year's tournament, 13 teams, something more than 100 youngsters, is one of the smallest because it began late, and tentatively; it seemed unlikely that Manigault, his heart irrevocably damaged by drugs, alcohol, street living, jail, would see summer. Last winter, after the Columbia-Presbyterian Transplant Unit rejected him as a poor medical and social risk, Manigault was weak and barely coherent. It seemed as though only the legend was left.Uptown, it is still a powerful legend of a teen-age prodigy who could pick dimes off a backboard, who dunked over Kareem when Kareem was still Lew Alcindor; a 6-foot-1-inch guard who could control anything on the court and nothing off it. He didn't stay in college and he didn't make the pros. He became famous for failure, an easy metaphor for the dark side of the city game, where the best are often the most self-destructive.&quot;I'm not into the Dream Team,&quot; says Manigault. &quot;It's not right. Should be amateur. I could pull one or two players off every block around here, go to the Olympics and win a gold medal.&quot;&quot;That's the urban myth,&quot; I say.&quot;That's the word,&quot; says Manigault.He moves off to get the first game started and disappears into the late afternoon swirl of Goat Park, 12-year-old fans, old men, babies, winos, players, hustlers, a pulse that helped bring him back to life.He has also had remarkable friends. A Princeton professor, Stephen F. Cohen, has been a fierce lobbyist for more than 20 years, and the foundation head, Walter Naegle, has fed and housed him. They found the city apartment he now shares with his two grown sons.A young cardiology fellow at Bellevue, Dr. Mimi Guarneri, &quot;tuned up&quot; Manigault this year. He is now being seriously considered for a heart by the transplant unit at Mount Sinai, he says.&quot;This is his challenge now,&quot; says Ray Diaz, a 29-year-old record company executive who learned the game as a youngster in this tournament. &quot;It's his second life. The future is not about keeping up the legend but about helping the kids.&quot;The Golden Hoops man is getting impatient: &quot;You gonna be there?&quot;&quot;This is what he has to deal with all the time,&quot; says Diaz, who starred in high school, college, and the Puerto Rican pro leagues. He has his own tournament now. &quot;How does one be a legend? He's worth a million dollars and he doesn't have a dime.&quot;Manigault nods to the Golden Hoops man. He'll be there, he says. He turns back to the game to watch its star, Patrice Casimer of the nearby Franciscan Community Youth Center, a compact point guard with presence. Patrice is going into his senior year at Cardinal Hayes High School. He is being recruited by colleges and drug dealers.&quot;We're working on Patrice's game and head,&quot; says Alex Achille, the center's director and a former Goat tournament player. &quot;A lot of drug dealers want him to play on their teams.&quot;&quot;Why is that bad?&quot; I ask.&quot;What's the point of all this,&quot; says Achille, &quot;if a 10-year-old kid is looking up to a dealer?&quot;Manigault drifts by. &quot;The dealers I came up with are all dead or doing big time,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know these new kids.&quot;&quot;You wouldn't take their money?&quot; I ask.&quot;I said I didn't know them; I didn't say I woudn't take their money.&quot; He smiles slyly. &quot;I just wouldn't go ask 'em.&quot;&quot;Money from Michael is our next big move,&quot; says Diaz. &quot;Spike Lee will get us to Michael, who's got to be thinking movies next, right? He needs that first credible role. We got the script.

"IT IS understandable that Michael Jordan, the most identifiable man in American sport, would find it a little disconcerting to see his face slapped on the chest of almost every man, mother and child in the US.So the emperor of US professional basketball has issued a new edict about clothing.From March 31, no one, absolutely no one, will be able to put Jordan's face or name on any form of souvenir unless it isNike, the world's largest manufacturer of sporting apparel.&nbsp;Not even the NBA, which will be restricted to selling Jordan's No.23 Chicago Bulls shirt because team uniforms are the property of the NBA and not the individual player.It is not surprising that Jordan has finally called an end to the liberal use of his image and name which left Chicago in a sea of Jordan T-shirts after their title victory last year.And if the personal reasons are not enough, the financial ones are certainly worth considering.Jordan makes a mere $4.22 million from playing basketball. He collects more than $30 milllion selling a variety of products ranging from Wheaties, Hanes underwear to McDonald's food, Gatorade and the Illinois state lottery.&nbsp;Nikelast year sold more than $300 million in goods featuring Jordan and will make a great deal more after March 31.Now at the NBA, there are mutters of discontent.

"&nbsp;Random observations from the wide, wide world of television sports: - Bo Jackson came through a television the other night. Walked right through the sucker in an effort to express his utter disgust with the medium, one supposes.  Of course, it wasn't real. It was merely another in a seemingly endless series of clever (and somewhat disturbing)Niketelevision commercials.  Do we know Bo in any other way?  Anyway, in this one Jackson spoofs his image (created in previous commercials, naturally) that he can do anything. In the middle of the spot, Bo walks off a lavish stage set, complete with musicians and beautiful back-up singers.  He walks right through a TV set into a living room, where he chides a little boy who is sitting there for watching too much television. He then heads to a gym where he is shown going about the difficult business of rehabilitating his career.  The career that exists outside of commercials, that is.  The message, presumably, is that what Bo is really all about is hard work and sweat, which is not exactly whatNikewas saying in its earlier ''Bo knows'' commercials. No, those implied that everything from hockey to rocket science came naturally to this wondrous athlete.  This time, there's work involved and since the product being advertised is something worn in weight rooms and gymnasiums, it makes sense to finally put Jackson in such a setting. The message about hard work was equally welcome and Tuesday's All-Star game was a great place for the spot to make its debut.&nbsp;But let's pause here for a healthy dose of cynicism. Bo Jackson chastising a kid for watching too much television? Bo Jackson telling us that image is not everything? Who's kidding who? Not that it is Jackson's fault, but no athlete has been dominated by his TV image more than Jackson. Jackson's pro sports career, as spectacular as it was in brief spurts, could not compete with Jackson's TV image.  Most athletes need to be at or near the top of their games to sustain a career in commercial endorsements. All Jackson had to do w as be Bo.  This advertisement is proof of that. Jackson has yet to play an inning - and may never play an inning - in a Chicago White Sox uniform, and yet his Sox uniform (stylishly black, of course) is featured prominently in this advertisement.  Bo does not have any White Sox RBIs, but he does have a White Sox image.  Thanks toNike.Of course, image is whatNikeis selling, every bit as much as sneakers.  Images perpetrated by TV commercials. Images consumed willingly by little kids (and big ones, too) who watch too much TV.  Should we listen to Bo and not watch so much TV and go out and ''just do it''? Or, should we just sit back and be overwhelmed by the amazing and attractive image of Bo?Nikeis telling us to do the former while cleverly enticing us to do the latter.",0.106260262726,0.446633825944,475 words,BO'S LATESTNIKECOMMERCIAL DELIVERS A MIXED MESSAGE,1991-07-14 00:00:00,902 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
"&nbsp;THERE are two works on tennis at the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition. Turbo Tennis is a bronze girl with pigtails, racket and roller-skates. The other is a naive painting called Centre Court which bears no relation to Wimbledon.The same hand is responsible for the only rugby offering, World Cup Final, which has no sense of occasion or Twickenham - making two impostors, treated just the same. Perhaps the Kipling quote, reproduced at the entrance to the Centre Court, went to the artist's head.&nbsp;The exhibition also includes three works on football, two on cricket, one each on boxing and the London Marathon and, in the architectural section, the National Hockey Stadium at Milton Keynes. And that is all.It is uncertain which is more naive, the work or the hanging committee. But, when it comes to hanging, the committee is more deserving. There should be no surprise that sport is ill-represented. So is art. This is evidently the age of infant daub and abstract artifice.Yet Britain has a noble heritage in sporting art and now a minister of both and more. If the Summer Exhibition has sunk beyond the pale, where junk enough is hung in Piccadilly on Sundays, David Mellor has a clear opportunity to relax the tug-of-war between grant-seeking factions by setting up an exhibition of sporting art. He has only himself to persuade.SPAIN's peculiar trademark law is threatening to put a sock inNike'ssponsorship of the United States Olympic track and field team. An attorney owns theNikename in Spain, registered 60 years ago by a Barcelona sock maker.  Without his permission - and he shows no hurry to grant it for nothing - athletes cannot use the name.Nike(US) talk of &quot;trademark piracy&quot;.Spanish laws used to permit anyone to register and renew a name simply by paying a fee, even without ever producing anything. Though the statutes were changed in 1988, registrants still do not have to prove they have an on-going business or product when filing an application. If the brand is not used in five years, a challenger must sue the trademark's owner, who then has three months to begin using the mark.In July 1990Nike(US) were issued a registration for their name but two Spanish courts have since upheld the earlier trademark. Though this applies only to sports apparel, not shoes,Nike(US) put potential sales losses at pounds 11 1/2 million in Spain and many times that worldwide.

"SWOOSHThe Unauthorized Story ofNikeand the Men Who Played There.By J. B. Strasser and Laurie Becklund.Illustrated. 682 pp. New York:Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $24.95.&nbsp;ONCE upon a time, people did not jog. The very notion of lacing up hideously expensive sneakers to trot along the roadside at a sweat-breaking pace would simply never have occurred to the ordinary person.There were sports shoes, of course, manufactured by a handful of low-profile companies catering to professional and amateur athletes who ran track or played team sports. But for typical middle-class Americans, a complete sports-shoe wardrobe comprised a pair of tennis shoes, some golf shoes with parquet-marring cleats, and a pair of high-top sneakers for shooting baskets with the guys.Then, in the mid-1960's, something happened. Almost overnight, the loneliness of the long-distance runner was invaded by hordes of health-conscious converts to the runner's religion. Fad became frenzy: if you weren't jogging, you should have been jogging. And for the shoe business, the world turned upside down.Suddenly the sports footwear market became an arena worth fighting for. And fight the shoemakers did -- across national borders, with shifting alliances, by fair means and foul. Despite its inane title -- the &quot;Swoosh&quot; is the fat, lopsided chevron that isNike'strademark -- this is a lively and engrossing account of that battle, as told from the perspective of the men who fought to pushNikefrom nowhere to the front ranks of its industry.A raucous crew they were, too. A more accurate subtitle for the book would have been &quot; 'Chariots of Fire' Meets 'Animal House.' &quot;Nikeexecutives routinely punished themselves with grueling international travel, impossible production deadlines, constant financial anxiety -- and used alcohol as an ever-present anodyne. Marriages fell apart. People fell apart. Sometimes even the shoes fell apart. But the bombardment of the competition -- chiefly Adidas, the German running-shoe giant -- continued without so much as an occasional cease-fire. Ultimately, it was a war with few heroes and many, many casualties.The silent, implacable general in the fight was Philip H. (Buck) Knight, the enigmatic Oregonian who willedNikeinto existence and who is still chairman of the $3 billion public company that his brainchild has become. At the University of Oregon in the late 50's, Buck Knight -- a shy, monkish accounting student -- was a competent but unspectacular runner for Bill Bowerman, the school's legendary track coach. In late 1963, when Mr. Knight decided to go into the shoe business, Mr. Bowerman agreed to help him -- for a half-interest in Blue Ribbon Sports, the company that would becomeNike.For Mr. Bowerman, the perfect running shoe was the Holy Grail. Years before he teamed up with Mr. Knight, he had been cobbling together his own experimental versions for his top runners. But those were amateur endeavors; when he sealed theNikepartnership with a handshake, Mr. Bowerman went pro. He put Mr. Knight's shoes on the feet of his own hero athletes -- an endorsement from Olympus in the runner's world -- and he contributed to the research process. He quietly sold his cachet, his influence with young athletes, toNike.In return, he eventually became very rich.It was on just such alliances that theNikeempire was built. The Bowerman connection was perhaps more noble than some of the later cash-for-cachet dealsNikeentered into with amateur and professional athletes and coaches. And it was certainly less crass than the liaisons already forged by a few ofNike'srivals. But it was the first step in a process that ultimately came to define the company and, indeed, the entire industry.That process reached its fullest development inNike'sdealing with Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, the electrifying athlete whose association withNikeput the term &quot;Air Jordans&quot; into the sports lexicon -- and burned a desire for fancy footwear into the minds of countless impoverished city youths. At the peak of the Air Jordan frenzy in 1985, the $65 shoes were being resold on the street for $100 a pair. &quot;I can't wear them around here,&quot; one National Basketball Association executive said at the time. &quot;I'm afraid they'd be taken away from me on the way to work by some kid with a gun.&quot;For some of the men who builtNike,this commercialization of the sports they cherished and the athletes they idealized felt like heartbreak, or like betrayal. But for most of them, it felt like a war -- against richer, more powerful European adversaries like Adidas and Puma, against Asian factories and finance companies who wanted more of the action, against the pushy agents who handled the star athletes, and even -- sadly, too often -- against one another.The book's major flaw is its failure to illuminate the man who started it all -- a shortcoming that perhaps cannot be entirely attributed to its authors, J. B. Strasser, a formerNikeemployee (whose husband, Rob Strasser, is one of the company's founding executives and now part owner of a consulting firm that works for aNikerival), and her sister, Laurie Becklund, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times. Phil Knight remains, after hundreds of pages, the same indistinct and enigmatic figure he was when the story opened. A &quot;black hole,&quot; one of his subordinates once called him. The &quot;masked man,&quot; pronounced another. Mr. Knight offered little cooperation with this book, its authors concede in their preface, and he emerges mostly as a mosaic of images: Buck Knight as seen by the other actors on the stage. There is little sense of what drove him, what inspired him, why he did what he did -- except for a poignant suggestion, as the story is ending, that he might, just possibly, have done it for the money.CertainlyNikemade enormous amounts of money for the people who built it. When the company went public in 1980, Mr. Knight joined the ranks of the very rich. The ruinous effect of success on an entrepreneurial company is a threadbare cliche in business, of course, but in &quot;Swoosh&quot; it is transformed into an exciting, intimate adventure that gives the old tale a fresh gloss.The fundamental wonder of theNikestory is that so much emotion and effort and imagination have been expended on behalf of a slab of rubber and a few scraps of nylon mesh. However, the authors of &quot;Swoosh&quot; are occasionally able to lift the running shoe to the level of cultural icon. At those moments,Nike'sstory begins to echo that of an entire generation -- those newborns of the baby boom who rebelled in the 60's, jogged through the 70's, memorized aerobic pulse levels in the 80's and have arrived at the 90's with tender joints and at least three pairs of athletic shoes on the floor of the closet.Odds are, at least some of those shoes areNikes.GRAPHIC:Photo: Philip (Buck) Knight in 1962, before he foundedNikeInc., breaking the tape in a pair of Adidas shoes.

"&nbsp;If Bo Jackson's sporting career is over, that would make him the last of the great baseball stars, and even he didn't exactly qualify. He was a hybrid, a baseball-football freak whose like we hadn't seen since Jim Thorpe. And it took a shoe commercial to make him really famous anyway.  Where are the great baseball stars? I mean real stars, Ruthian stars, where-have-you-gone-Joe-DiMaggio stars? Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Hammerin' Hank stars?  As far as I can tell, there aren't any, even though baseball, as a game, is bigger, grander, more popular than ever, or haven't you tried pricing baseball cards lately? And even though we live in an era where anyone - picture your name here - can be a celebrity.  It isn't as if the games we play aren't yielding heroes. Michael Jordan is the only man in America whose popularity rivals Stormin' Norman (take note: he drinks Diet Pepsi) Schwarzkopf. He is On-The-Air Jordan. Talk about hang time, Jordan has true staying power, from your shoes to your breakfast table to your soft drink to who knows where it will end. It doesn't stop with Jordan, either. Old people get Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Young people get Boris Becker and John McEnroe. Magic Johnson, Mr. Robinson. And Joe Montana, he's everywhere now. Even Mike Tyson. Greg Lemond - who rides a bicycle - gets Taco Bell. Basketball, football, boxing, cycling, golf, tennis.  Baseball, anyone?  Maybe it's the criteria we set for stardom these days.&nbsp;In the modern era, stardom has come to mean endorsements, commercials, TV time.Nikemade Bo; Bo didn't makeNike. Nikedid as much for Bo as Miller Lite did for Marv Throneberry. It's all an advertising game.  Let's take the case of David Robinson, who is a fine basketball player but no better than Patrick Ewing or Hakeem Olajuwon. Somebody in advertising picked out Robinson, who is bright and articulate, but the ad boys didn't trade on that, either. They made Robinson into the stereotypical 7-foot mean guy whose path you had better cross only with caution, in comic juxtaposition with the numbing calmness of Mr. Rogers. It's a media creation, and Mr.  Robinson, although he performs in a small market, is now a media star.  Why didn't somebody pick Rickey Henderson instead?  There is one easy explanation, and that's shoes. Basketball players wear shoes that people buy by the millions, pumping up the volume. People don't kick back in cleats, if only for safety reasons. The shoe industry and the National Basketball Association have fed nicely on each other in classic economic symbiosis, and they've both grown apace. And there's the crossover effect. Minute Maid is coming out with a commercial starring Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins and Ewing, who are hot because basketball is hot becauseNikecommercials are hot.  But Boomer Esiason just got a Reebok commercial. Why not Don Mattingly? Why not Eric Davis? Why not Ryne Sandberg? Why not Dwight Gooden?  Nolan Ryan is getting work these days, but, gosh, is there a better story anywhere in sports? This guy is a biological phenomenon who, by any logic, ought to be a megastar - but who isn't, at least on Madison Avenue.  Even the experts are stumped. If the time is ripe for anti-heroes - McEnroe, Jim McMahon, Brian Bosworth, Charles Barkley - why not Jose Canseco, who has fame, personality and all the bad, bad boy you could ask for? Go figure.  There are actually more stars, in the old sense, in baseball than in any other sport. There are names that people who follow baseball know. But as it was explained to me, baseball, in advertising jargon, is an ''old reliable brand'' and therefore possesses limited sex appeal. And it's a regional brand.  Cal Ripken is big in Baltimore, Andre Dawson in Chicago and Michael Jordan everywhere.  But could there be more to it? Has baseball somehow become a faceless sport? Or is it that the real heroes, say Pete Rose, have shown themselves to be flawed?",0.104821339862,0.514841920375,658 words,ADVERTISING WORLD SNUBS THE STARS OF OLD RELIABLE - BASEBALL,1991-03-31 00:00:00,911 of 998 DOCUMENTS,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
"The Atlanta Braves are a victory away from reaching the World Series tonight at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, but everybody is engrossed with the guy who isn't here. We're talking about Deion Sanders, whose mind is elsewhere.Maybe it's in Buckhead.Maybe it's in Miami.&nbsp;Maybe it's in Beavertown, Ore., whereNikemakes enough money to make Sanders do goofy things.There was Sanders's latest silliness that began Saturday night after Game 4 of the National League Championship Series in Pittsburgh. First, he took a limo to the airport. Then he caught a charter to Miami for Sunday's Falcons game against the Dolphins. Then he swam the English Channel. Then he shot deer in Alaska. Then he sauntered into the Braves' clubhouse for Sunday's Game 5 against the Pirates.Braves president Stan Kasten isn't pleased these days. After all, Kasten is o ne of the few sports executives who was forced to phone one of his players to ask that player what his plans were for the next day.&quot;The details were a little sketchy,&quot; said Kasten, hours after he dialed Sanders in his hotel room Saturday. Witnesses said the conversation between Kasten and Sanders was rather loud. Anyway, somebody asked Kasten if Sanders would do what he was rumored to do after flying to the Falcons' game and hustle back to town to continue his role as the most overpublicized bench player in baseball history.&quot;He didn't say,&quot; said Kasten, grinning, with eyebrows raised. &quot;I'm just assuming that he's coming back.&quot;Braves general manager John Schuerholz isn't pleased with Sanders, either. Schuerholz says he wouldn't have placed Sanders on the Braves' playoff roster if he knew Sanders would renege on his agreement to stay exclusively with the Braves throughout the postseason.&quot;I'll discuss the situation after the playoffs,&quot; said Schuerholz, his words toasting Pittsburgh's chilly air. As for Braves manager Bobby Cox, when asked if Sanders's latest silliness would have been worse if Sanders weren't just another guy on the roster, &quot;If he were a starter doing this, it would be a huge issue. Now it's just an issue.&quot;No, this is just Deion Sanders, the ego that both the Braves and the Falcons can do without. Sanders's ego is the size of Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and the Georgia Dome. Sanders's ego is out of control. Fortunately, for Atlanta sports fans, Sanders's ego can become somebody else's problem in 1993, since neither the Braves nor the Falcons are contractually obligated to the guy after their respective seasons.The sad thing is that it has taken the ultimate of silliness from Sanders to make the Braves see what they should have seen all along, and that is Deion Sanders cares only about Deion Sanders. Well, that and his three-year, $ 3 million contract withNike. In fact,Nikeis making a commercial of Sanders's latest silliness.Nikeruns Sanders. If he plays only one sport someday,Nikesays it will cut his payroll by $ 900,000 per year.That &quot;someday&quot; for Sanders might come soon within these city limits, hopefully in regard to the Braves and the Falcons.Sanders stopped talking to the local media, by the way, because of your afternoon columnist. I wrote last month that Sanders was embarrassing himself by saying the Falcons were using a &quot;plantation&quot; mentality during negotiations that gave him a $ 2 million salary with the team this season.I wrote that Sanders should &quot;shut up,&quot; and he did. He said he was doing so because of me.Well, I blew it. If I'd known that Sanders follows my advice, I'd have asked for a piece of hisNikecontract. I can't ask now, because Sanders told author John Feinstein in regards to why he doesn't talk to the local media, &quot;They had the privilege, they abused the privilege, and now they've lost the privilege.&quot;Darn.",0.0268382352941,0.529411764706,631 words,"Sanders loyal only to himself,Nike",1992-10-13 00:00:00,913 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

Teammates may not speak a common language, but they will be on a common payroll.&nbsp;Stirring medal ceremonies will consist of some 30-second spot flashed on a big screen - no doubt directed by Spike Lee - while the theme of the gold medal winner's sponsor blares over the sound system.It's honestly not that far away.Some U.S. track and field performers already have shown us how difficult it is to keep a team together on the flimsy basis of pride-in- country.Tuesday, Danny Everett of the 1,600-meter relay went to the media with complaints that his choice, Andrew Valmon, was excluded from the four-man team in favor of Michael Johnson because of shoe politics. He charged that coach Mel Rosen and Johnson were solemates - bothNikeguys - and they conspired to keep Valmon off the team because he does not have the proper insignia on his shoe. Never mind that Johnson is probably the more capable 400-meter man.You can see bad things coming for this relay team. Maybe a baton gets dropped because somebody's contract prohibits contact with another athlete from a different company.This team doesn't need training, it requires a corporate merger.Europe has broken up or recombined because of politics and age-old ethnic divisions. The United States is breaking up over footwear.The lines already have blurred concerning who is competing for whom. Track's biggest stars have been independent agents for a long time, collecting beneath the U.S. flag once every four years. The arrangement has never seemed more transparent than here.If you wanted to interview Carl Lewis at the start of the Games, that would not be arranged by the United States Olympic Committee, but rather by the athletics-wear company, Mizuno. You would be directed by helpful Mizuno employees to a cramped, steamy atrium where Lewis would meet the world's media and discuss the current state of business. Another giant in the world of overpriced sneakers, Asics, was proud to announce its news conference Wednesday with 100-meter contender Leroy Burrell. Also on hand would be company chairman Kihachico Onitsuka. Used to be, athletes appeared with their coaches. Now they tow foreign CEOs.Undisputed champion of redesigning the Olympics isNike, which is running almost daily orchestrated media events at a theater it rented in downtown Barcelona. It has claimed outright many of the most popular athletes here as its own, ignoring whatever other insignia they may bear. The only differentiation it makes between people is in size and width.Michael Jordan and Commonwealth of Independent States pole-vaulter Sergei Bubka appeared almost as teammates together on theNikestage, the conference moderated by NBC's Ahmad Rashad. Call it a seminar on hang time.Charles Barkley stopped by. Scheduled to follow were members of the Croatian basketball team. Most ambitious yet is the &quot;NikeInternational Track and Field Team&quot; -Nike'stitle, not mine. Consisting of such diverse members as the previously maligned Michael Johnson, Chinese hurdler Tong Li, Nigerian sprinter Mary Onyali and middle-distance runner Letitia Vriesde of Suriname, they are supposed to appear today as one big, happy, nylon-upper coalition.I like the chances of theNikeInternational Track and Field Team to do well in the medal count in these Games. TheNikemachine should be a force for Olympics to come.For all this time, idealists have dreamed about weaning the Olympics from its nationalism, the unseemly flag-waving and jingoism. That is being steadily attended to by the makers of fine leisure wear. In the near future, the worst chant you'll hear at the Olympic Stadium will go something like:&quot;Your shoe stinks! Your shoe stinks!&quot;",0.0289115646259,0.493537414966,681 words,BARCELONA OLYMPICS Mercenary athletes use hard-sell on soft shoes,1992-07-30 00:00:00,918 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution

"TheNike/ABCD Basketball Camp, the swoosh-stripe fashion show that doubles as a showcase for the USA's most dazzling high school boys basketball talent, concluded last week.Participants hailed it as one of the best ever. Although the camp stresses academics, featuring five hours of classwork daily, its dribbles might be numbered.A controversial piece of legislation from the National Association of Basketball Coaches is aimed at reining in summer camps.&nbsp;The NABC says the current system fails in several areas:- It allows third parties to exert influence over prospects in recruiting or act as middlemen between players and college coaches.- It forces coaches to crisscross the country for all of July to put in appearances watching prospects; such appearances are believed to be essential in wooing recruits.That runs at odds with cost-cutting measures the NCAA is trying to enforce.''It's an area that's totally unregulated,'' said University of Southern California coach George Raveling, chairman of the NABC Recruiting Committee.The committee recommends that the NCAA start regulating. Its suggestion: nine NCAA-sponsored regional camps.The recommendation goes before the NCAA Council July 31. If it passes, it will be forwarded to the NCAA convention in January, where university presidents will vote on it as a two-year pilot program to be implemented in summer 1993.''I think it has a real good chance of passing,'' said Rick Evrard, NCAA director of legislative services.According to the NABC plan, only high school seniors-to-be (not other underclassmen) would be invited to its camps, at a cost of $ 75, and only high school coaches would work at the camps.Most important, these would be the only camps college coaches are permitted to attend, which presumably would put talent shows likeNikein the shoebox.''I think it's ludicrous,'' saidNikecoordinator Sonny Vaccaro, the man who outfits his 120 campers in shoes, shirts and shorts - and the man whom some call the most powerful in college basketball because of his shoe deals with dozens of the game's top coaches.''I think it's blind. And the reasons aren't good enough for me to believe that what they're trying to do is for the best interests of the kids.''Raveling stressed he is merely the chairman of the NABC's Recruiting Committee, not a lone firebrand.''I'm interested in who these people are who think it's a slim chance,'' he said. ''They're certainly not the people who vote on it. ... A lot of coaches want to demonstrate to adminstrators they're on the same page.''Raveling said he has been banned from three camps for his advocacy of a new summer system.The only camp Raveling would name that he said has banned him is Dave Krider's All-American camp in Cincinnati. Krider also is sports editor for the La Porte (Ind.) Herald-Argus and picks all-USA teams for USA TODAY.Raveling said players are saying they feel pressured to attend Krider's camp in order to boost chances of being all-USA.''We don't promise kids anything,'' Krider said. ''I have never, ever told kids anything as far as my position at USA TODAY helping them in any way.''Krider's camp made its debut last year. He and partner Bobby Kortsen charged coaches $ 200 for Kortsen's scouting service - which they had to buy in order to gain access to floor seating at the University of Cincinnati's Shoemaker Center.Krider, who will charge only $ 15 this year, claims some schools spend more than $ 20,000 on recruiting, ''so how much is $ 200 really?'' Krider also alleges that at their camps, Bill Cronauer (BC Camp) and Howard Garfinkel (Five Star) have sold private information on prospects. Garfinkel could not be reached, but Cronauer denies the charge.The divisiveness among camps, Raveling said, keeps them from presenting a united front to discuss the issue with the NABC.''Everyone is pointing his finger at the other guy,'' he said. ''There's a need for regulation. You can't even get five of them in the same room to arbitrate.''Several college coaches scouting Vaccaro's camp had reservations about the new proposal.''It's mixed, I think,'' Georgetown's John Thompson said of the coaches' reaction. ''I think a lot of guys are for it because of what they perceive it to be: They perceive it to be something where the NCAA will take total supervision and there will be no influences at all.''. ... But is the NCAA capable of administering a camp? Let's stop and think about that. They can't even administer enforcement services; they don't have enough people. Where's the (camp) staff going to come from? Where's the funding going to come from?''",0.141020854146,0.495683066933,778 words,College basketball coaches mostly unhappy campers,1991-07-15 00:00:00,922 of 998 DOCUMENTS,USA TODAY
"With so many types of sports shoes in the market, how do you pick the right one? MARY ROSE GASMIER asks a man who should know.WHETHER you are a big-foot, small-foot, thin-foot or fat-foot, the point of buying sports shoes is to get a pair that fits your particular needs. And one man who should know how to go about doing this is James Spiro Davis, 49, chairman of New Balance.New Balance's American sales of US$ 95 million (S$ 153 million) last year limp far behindNike'sUS$ 1.7 billion and Reebok's US$ 1.3 billion in the same period.Nikeholds 29.8 per cent of the United States market, Reebok 22.8 per cent. New Balance trails with just 1.8 per cent.&nbsp;Given these figures, and as Mr Davis was on a selling mission here last week, some sales talk is perhaps understandable.&quot;We don't have the promotional budget thatNikehas but I just believe that ours is a far superior product,&quot; he says, sunk in an armchair in the lobby of the Shangri-la Hotel.To his credit, though, when asked for advice on what the Singapore consumer should look for in a pair of athletic shoes, he immediately sits up to give clear, detailed instructions, then stands up to demonstrate how to test your shoe.He suggests several factors one should bear in mind when selecting athletic shoes:&lt;&gt; The most important factor is correct fit: Most shoes are produced in lengths but European feet are longer and narrower, whereas Asian feet are shorter and broader. So the best-fitting shoes are those that offer the width and length appropriate to your foot. A shoe that looks good but does not fit may cause blisters.&lt;&gt; When shopping for a shoe, first decide what you will use it for: This is where product performance comes in.&lt;&gt; Shoes are designed differently for men and women because women have narrower heels, so when selecting a model, make sure that it is also the correct &quot;gender&quot;.A shoe usually has two soles. The outer outsole is made of durable high-carbon rubbers mixed with chemicals and pigments. It is glued with a urethane-based cement onto the inner midsole.The midsole consists of ethylene-vinylacetate or high-density polyurethane which is usually thicker from the heel to mid-foot to give stability and shock-absorption for the &quot;heel strike&quot;, the hard landing on the heel when one runs or jumps.The midsole is usually made of softer, lower-density polyurethane for the upper part of the foot, which lands more gently during exercise.If the materials are of poor quality, a shoe that appears to have a lot of spring and offers a good cushioning effect when you walk up and down in the store may, over time, lose resiliency.&lt;&gt; So, in buying running shoes, a &quot;hard-heel lander&quot; whose heel normally hits the ground very hard, should look for a running shoe with a reinforced heel -this may be an extra rubber pad that runs in a horseshoe shape round the outer edge of the shoe heel.Those who tend to run more on the balls of their feet should look for extra reinforcement in this area.Pick a shoe that offers more forward-backward stability and less torque (sideways wobble).  These are usually found in shoes which have a fairly high midsole.Shoes like this are also good for heavy people who need stable shoes that can take their weight and will not wobble with each stride. They also offer better grip for cross-country runs or rock-climbing.&lt;&gt; Running shoes for track and field use and for competitive sports should be lighter, with thinner midsoles and outsoles made of lower-density ethylene-vinylacetate.The lightness is important for running speed, and the heels are better designed to take the lighter weight of athletes who are generally slim-built. Such shoes should have little torque and more forward-backward stability.&lt;&gt; For court games like tennis or squash, choose shoes that allow easy sideways movement.  Running shoes like those described above do not fit this purpose as they are not designed for sideways jumps and leaps: The midsole is too high and there is not enough build-up of the sole around the edges.When testing the shoes in the shop, move as you would on a court to test flexibility.Knowledgeable salesmen can tell you which model offers a better grip on a wood surface, such as a squash court, and which on hard ground or artificial surfaces.&lt;&gt; If you engage in very strenuous activity, you should check for uppers with nylon-mesh which allow air circulation and easy evaporation of sweat. All-leather uppers will retain heat and cause discomfort.",0.131860702261,0.445978884079,1374 words,The right fit,1992-11-19 00:00:00,925 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Straits Times
"Leave it to Andre Agassi.Or perhaps, to be more accurate,Nike.First, the swashbuckling Las Vegan turns the stuffy tennis world on its ear with his tousled tie-dyed hair and stone-washed denim shorts. Not satisfied with this tradition-flaunting attire, he then - with the blessing ofNike,his clothier of record - adds Day-Glo cycling shorts and crop-topped shirts.&nbsp;Then, just when purists have reluctantly started to resign themselves to this godawful apparition, the born-again Agassi embraces . . . tradition.In keeping with his image as a creature of extremes, for his maiden appearance yesterday at centre court at the All England Club the clean-shaven Agassi wore (gasp) white.White warmup suit. White crop-topped shirt. White shorts with white lycra cycling shorts. White socks. White tennis shoes. White headband.A contrast was Grant Connell, Agassi's Canadian-born opponent who was also dressed byNike.He looked like a peacock - even though he conformed to Wimbledon's &quot;predominantly white&quot; clothing rules. That is to say, the Vancouver southpaw's shoes had jade green markings and his first shirt was splashed with blue and hot pink.At 3:45 p.m., Agassi, swathed in a white nylon warmup suit, arrived on centre court to a swell of applause from a gallery that included the Duchess of Kent.Milking the occasion for all it was worth, Agassi went over to his chair and slowly, like a stripper, began to disrobe. As he took off his pants, revealing his white look, there were wolf whistles, cheers, applause.When rain began again at 5:08 p.m., washing out play for the rest of the day with but a meager six matches completed, Agassi and Connell were level at one set each and 1-1 in games in the third. The No. 73-ranked Connell took the first 6-4 and the fifth-seeded Agassi the second 6-1.In what had to be most distracting and intimidating circumstances, Connell did himself proud. He kept his poise, served and volleyed well and moved confidently on the slippery grass. He broke Agassi in the seventh game, then conceded just three more points on his own serve en route to claiming the first set.Agassi, who had not played a grass court match since losing in the first round here in 1987, started out looking uncomfortable on the unfamiliar turf but grew increasingly comfortable and aggressive as the match progressed. By the second set, he'd harnessed his errant first serve and begun whaling his returns of serve, racking up 16 winners, and broke Connell twice to build a 5-0 lead. When Agassi is firing at that level, no one can blunt his attack.But while Agassi had the momentum when play stopped, he is vulnerable on grass. There is no evidence that his volleying has improved. He still tends to wind up and take a big swing in midcourt, rarely comes in to crowd the net, rarely opts to come in to volley off his serve. In other words, he has made few adjustments to his normal hard-hitting style to accommodate the vagaries of grass.He might beat Connell. But he's won't be a serious contender for the men's title.Connell is not throwing in the towel. Having put to rest his prematch jitters and having had some time to assess the match, he's not pessimistic that he can come back and win - weather permitting.&quot;It was a great feeling. I loved it. But he's damn good, so I have to get in my first serves and then it's down to two out of three.&quot;In other matches, top-seeded defending champion Stefan Edberg finally finished the match he started Tuesday, defeating Swiss Marc Rosset 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

"Among the great moments in athletic apparel history, 1985 will be recorded as the year that changed us forever.It was the year Cybill Shepherd showed up at the Emmy Awards wearing a black strapless gown and high-top orange Reeboks.And it was the yearNikesigned an NBA rookie named Michael Jordan to a $ 5 million, five-year endorsement contract to launch a shoe called Air Jordan.&nbsp;Since then, America has had a hard time deciding whether $ 80 sneakers are for show or for function. Along the way, sports apparel has become an estimated $ 21 billion-a-year industry in this country - and shoes are just the jumping-off point.As about 88,000 representatives of the nation's sporting goods industry converge on Atlanta this weekend for the Super Show, they will be looking at an industry that, if not recession-proof, is certainly in better shape than most of the economy.According to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the industry's retail sales, including equipment, hit $ 31.56 billion in 1991 - up 4.4 percent from 1990. And they're expected to accelerate again this year, climbing 5 percent to $ 33.14 billion.The industry's fiscal health, however, has little to do with the nation's physical health. According to a study by Kurt Salmon Associates, 80 percent of the sports apparel sold in this country is purchased by &quot;non-participants&quot;: those who buy for fashion, not function.Remember the Billy Crystal/Fernando gag, &quot;Better to look good than feel good&quot;? America takes it to heart.Reebok understood that appeal in 1985 when it sold its aerobic shoes in 27 colors and shifted the emphasis of its advertising from performance to high fashion. But whenNike'sAir Jordan sales hit $ 107 million nine months after it was launched, sneaker chic suddenly turned hard core: Americans wanted &quot;serious&quot; athletic apparel first - even if they were just wearing it for fashion.Reebok's sales slumped, andNike'ssoared.Reebok has since rebounded, introducing its &quot;Pump&quot; line of performance sneakers, selling $ 750 million worth, for up to $ 160 a pair, in two years. Still, 70 percent of Pump sales are for &quot;street use,&quot; according to the company. AndNikeestimates 50 percent of its Air Jordans, at up to $ 130 a pair, aren't worn for basketball.The companies have come under fire for allegedly marketing the shoes to youths who can't afford them. Some youths reportedly have been killed for the shoes.Reebok now is introducing a line of Pumps for under $ 100. And aNikespokesman says the company recognizes the problem, but denies it has aimed its ads at inner-city youth.&quot;Our target market is people who actually want to use the shoe for athletic purposes,&quot; says company spokeswoman Melinda Gable. &quot;We don't segment our advertising. It's national in scope.&quot;The performance appeal has since, like top athletes themselves, made the transition from amateur to pro.

"L.A.

They urge viewers to watch the shoe's launch in an ad to run during Super Bowl XXV on Sunday.Starring in the launch ad: Karl Malone, power forward for the Utah Jazz basketball team. It ends with a slogan referring to rival shoes as hot air - a dig at sneaker giantNikeInc.'s best-selling Air line.''It's directed at certain people, obviously,'' says Sandy Saemann, exec VP of L.A.

Gear became the USA's No. 3 sneakers firm, behindNikeand Reebok International Ltd., by marketing fashion-oriented shoes that women loved. But the market turned more performance-oriented, -leaving L.A. Gear at a disadvantage. L.A.

"&nbsp;DIAMOND JUBILATION How strong have the Toronto Blue Jays been in recent years, even though the club has never gone all the way? Consider this statistic: If the period from 1983 to 1991 had been one endless nine-year season, the Blue Jays would have had an outrageous 37-game lead over the next-best team in the American League.GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWSWhen he won the Masters, Fred Couples' earnings for the golf season reached $ 1,008,162.&nbsp;This made him the sixth player in PGA Tour history to get to the seven-figure mark for a year, but he did it in the shortest amount of time. On the other hand, it has to be a bit deflating for Couples to know his record surge put him just a little ahead of the average major league baseball salary.THAT'S SHOE BUSINESS Consumer Reports is out with ratings of 32 brands of running shoes and theNikeAir 180 model was ranked No. 2 for men. &quot;Toe box was like a slipper,&quot; said one runner.There's one catch to that lofty rating, though.

"Omni president/general manager Bob Dhue, citing competition from the&nbsp;Lakewood Amphitheater and the impending opening of the Georgia Dome in&nbsp;1992, has proposed a major renovation of the 18-year-old arena.In a presentation to the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority&nbsp;this week, Dhue outlined improvements and suggested bonds be approved to&nbsp;finance construction, since The Omni stands on public property. He&nbsp;emphasized The Omni would be responsible for the debt service and&nbsp;estimated the cost at between $ 3 million and $ 5 million.With recreation authority approval, construction could start as&nbsp;early as this summer and be complete well before the Georgia Dome opens.&nbsp;Among the proposals:- Convert interior concession stands to box suites, increasing the&nbsp;number from 12 to 32;- Knock out segments of the exterior walls and rebuild affected&nbsp;concession stands;- Double the restroom area;- Widen the concourse.Dhue said expansion of seating capacity from the current 16,600 was&nbsp;considered, but it was deemed unnecessary because the average attendance&nbsp;for 180 to 200 events per year is 11,000.&quot;To be competitive, we need to update,&quot; Dhue said. &quot;The Georgia Dome&nbsp;people have said they'd like to host college basketball games, SEC, ACC&nbsp;and NCAA tournaments, and as many as 12 rock concerts per year.

"A press conference featuring Michael Jordan and Sergei Bubka may have amplified global opinion, or at least the global media's opinion, of the athletes' prominence.Jordan and Bubka are part of the AirNikepromotional campaigns which have taken over the top floor of the hotel Torre Catalunya where daily media gatherings monitor the progress of some of their 100-plus U.S. track athletes and 12 or so from many of the other countries.There were 39 television cameras in the auditorium, giving the news conference the look of a presidential news conference. Only some of these cameras were from Finland and Austria and Japan.&nbsp;But Saturday's press conference took place at the Palacio Balana cinema. In front of the theatre a six-metre-long balloon of an AirNikesneaker sat atop of a parked bus. The theatre marquee that only days before had advertised The Hand that Rocks the Cradle now had huge red letters proclaiming JORDAN-BUBKA.When Jordan and Bubka landed in a residential district of Barcelona on Saturday, they confounded the neighbors and the regulars at the Bar Felipe.People stared from balconies of 10-storey brick apartment houses, where yellow and red Catalan flags were draped next to laundry. They looked with wonder at the scene below, where aNikebus blared rock 'n' roll and workers handed out hundreds of caps.The first six questions at the press conference were directed at Bubka. The voices spoke with varied accents. They asked about his health, his training, his goals, his homeland. The reporters were clearly intrigued by the Ukranian pole vaulter.Jordan, the American basketball/marketing superstar, sat quietly and listened. He is the star of &quot;The Dream Team,&quot; but he may not be the brightest star in the 1992 Olympic Games.Bubka has earned his place next to Jordan. Earlier this year, he set the world record at 20 feet, one-half inch. It was his 30th world record, indoors and outdoors. He won the Olympic gold medal in 1988. He has won six world titles.Bubka is so dominant that he rarely concerns himself with other competitors.&quot;When I was younger, the other competitors made me go higher . now, my main competition is the height.&quot;Bubka said he has two sources of motivation in Barcelona.First, because of the political changes of recent years, he is competing for his native Ukraine instead of the Soviet Union.&quot;When an athlete wins the gold medal, they must play the anthem of his native country and raise the flag of his native country. For me, it must be Ukraine. That will be very satisfying.&quot;Bubka is also driven by the Olympic stage.&quot;This is my second Olympics. In Seoul (1988), it was not a very good competition for me. The weather was very bad. The wind was bad. I won the gold medal, but I did not reach the world record. In Barcelona, the weather will be better and it is my dream to win the gold medal and set a world record.&quot;The key to Bubka's success is his athleticism. He long jumps, high jumps and sprints in practice.&quot;My coach wanted me to move from the pole vault to the decathlon, but I love the pole vault.&quot;Bubka also employs a gymnastics coach.&quot;There are many elements of gymnastics in the pole vault.&quot;Combine the speed of a sprinter, the burst of a jumper and the body control of a gymnast and the possibilities have Bubka thinking about 20-8 or 21-0.&quot;(21-0) is possible, but it would be difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;But by improving my body and improving my technique, I think it is possible to jump higher.&quot;The only flaw in the plan is a foot injury that forced him to withdraw from a meet earlier this month.&quot;Right now, there is just a little bit of pain.&quot;Falling from a height of 19 or 20 feet, year and year, could break down a man's body. But Bubka feels he is strong enough to persist.&quot;I know people think it will be difficult to keep jumping until I'm 32, but I think I will be jump in Atlanta (in the 1996 Olympics).&quot;There is also a financial motivation to keep jumping. The money he earns from endorsements and competition will take care of his family in the future. The political changes in the former Soviet Union have allowed him to bank more of his earnings.&quot;For many years when I was jumping, I did not make good money. Most of it went to the country. Now I can make some money, but that's not why I jump. I jump for love of sports. Money is second.&quot;Aside from his goals of world records, gold medals and financial security, he has another objective. He has two sons and he wants to get their attention.&quot;One day they want to play basketball. The next they want to golf. I keep hoping they will try the pole vault. Maybe it will happen some day.&quot;(Bill Utterback is a sportswriter for The Pittsburgh Press.)(With files from the Canadian Press and Southam News)",0.0817340565417,0.389852728468,808 words,Bubka casts shadow over Jordan; Pole vaulter's star shines as bright as Dream Team's guiding light,1992-07-26 00:00:00,950 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Ottawa Citizen
"All in all, we see now that there was a place for Communism in this world, and it was at the Olympics.So, for two lousy weeks, couldn't we at least revive Communism, make it another official Worldwide Olympic Sponsor and get the juices flowing here again?  But no, we've traded a wonderful dramatic conflict between Good and Evil, Capitalism and Socialism, for what?  ForNikevs. Reebok.  That's for what.The best we can do for a villain is Charles Barkley and maybe some heady little Chinese children.  (A billion Chinese may wonder when Communism ever left, but hey, we're talking about television here.) The whole earth's economy is going to hell, and the only issue in Barcelona is how rich is the International Olympic Committee getting.  The most popularcompetitionin tow is to watch the Dream Tam pick wings off flies.  For the first time since '72, there aren't any boycotts.  Even South Africa is back.  Even Castro dropped in.  This Olympics is so fat and happy, the Klingons could get in team handball.&nbsp;Oh, to be sure, there are always a few nit-pickers in any crowd that is only allowed to use Visa cards.  Spoilsports.  Speaking more or less on behalf of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the hometown Barcelona boy who is presidentproeternity of The Games, Barkley -- El Gordo, The Fat One -- answered Olympic critics thusly one day: &quot;Why don't they take their ass-whipping-like people and go home?&quot;Why indeed not?  Well, as much as the Dream Teamers may seem to NBC to be like those starlets who make folks happy by removing their tops at the Cannes Film Festival, others see the NBA heroes as representative of all that is rotten with the Kodak Olympics.  &quot;They may be your Dream Team,&quot; said Mike Moran of the U.S. Olympic Committee, &quot;but they're my nightmare.&quot; Where is the old Olympic spirit?  What became of yesteryear's noble amateurs?  Why can't these multimillionaires live in the Bausch &amp; Lomb Olympic Village instead of their fancy &quot;palaciohotel&quot; and learn love and fellowship there?  Well, answered Dreamer John Stockton: &quot;the Olympic spirit to me is to beat your opponents, not live with them.&quot;And so the Dreamers outscored Angola 46-1 over one stretch, winning 116-48, and next coasted over Croatia, its most formidable opponent, 103-70, and then whipped Germany and Brazil by other similar scores that read like what happens to a stock when the market crashes.Magic Johnson,Magia,was magnificent.  He said all the right things and did all the best things.  He was like Olga Korbut and Jesse Owens and Eleanor Holm and Jim Thorpe all rolled into one.  It was telling.  He strained his right knee early in the Croatian game and missed the balance of that game and all of the next two.  And although this left America without a point guard, the wheel kept right on turning.  In fact, the first 15 minutes of the German game was quite possibly the most surgically brilliant exhibition of team sport ever put on display.  But somehow it was different without Earvin Johnson.The fans understood that.  Barkley was the heavy, and the other Dreamers were admired artists.  Yet from the moment the great team arrived, Magic was the only one who really connected with the people.  The NBA's critics couldn't see past that irony, that for all the obvious gross excess of Team Dream, when No. 15 was on the court, only then did The Games come closest to the exuberant joy that we always hope they will be.  Then they truly have been the Magic Olympics; it's the rest of the time they've been only the Philips Olympics or the 3M Olympics.Michael Jordan was representative in his own way, too.  Ever since Peter Ueberroth instructed the IOC in how to obtain strength through sponsorship, everything at the Time/Sports Illustrated Olympics has been up for sale.  Reebok bought the rights to the United State's victory uniforms.  Jordan then declared his allegiance toNike, saying he would not go to the victory stand if forced to be garbed in the hated Reebok attire.The USOC countered with an ultimatum forcing all American winners to dress properly Reebokian, which was just as well withNikeofficials, who had, privately, cringed that Jordan could have been so obtuse.  But the company is such a huge international sporting power that soon it found itself mired in another money mess.Michael Johnson, the odds-on favorite to win the 200-meter gold, did not even try to qualify in the 400.  Johnson remains, however,Nike'sbiggest U.S. star, and when Mel Rosen, the U.S.-team coach, and long on theNikepayroll, suddenly named Johnson to the four-by-400-meter relay team, suspicions were everywhere voiced thatNikeman Rosen had been pressured byNiketo put theNikestar -- andNiketrack shoes -- in another event.Although Steve Miller,Nike's&quot;athletic director,&quot; lustily denied any such allegations, the other 400 runners had a mean screaming match with coach Rosen.  Worse, those American track-team members who don't enjoy dual citizenship withNikewere then furious to find Michael JohnsonNikeT shirts distributed by the USOC itself to everyone on the team.  Steve Lewis, Johnson's relayteammate,threw his gift shirt on the floor, screaming: &quot;Shoot, I'd rather put Homey the Clown on my shirt than Michael Johnson.&quot;This is the kind of stuff that becomes important at the Olympics after nationalism, terrorism and Communism cease to matter.  And, says Steve Miller ofNike: &quot;I think it'll get worse before it gets better.&quot; Money will do this to the Panasonic Olympics.Money has not, of course, been de facto evil for The Games.  But Barcelona shows all the more how, even, a split-level Olympics has emerged, with the few glamour sports getting all the attention and all the dough, while the other sports go begging.Then, too, nobody has the foggiest idea where all that money goes.  The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, struggling manfully to find out what its city was getting in bed with for the next four years, finally gave up and designed a computer analysis to seek some inkling of Olympic finances.  The computer estimates $ 2.4 billion revenue in this Olympiad, $ 3 billion the next.  Hundreds of millions are left over somewhere after The Games are put on.  Samaranch loves to refer to the Olympics, grandly, as a &quot;movement,&quot; but what it surely is is the most powerful and unaccountable private organization to have existed since the Roman church on the day before Luther tacked up some of his thoughts at Wittenberg.Samaranch, 72, just had his arm twisted to seek another term as president -- although he expects to be called His Excellency.  He is a schooled politician, who co-opts any internal opposition -- most recently, say, from the likes of the heads of the track and skating federations --- by railroading them onto the IOC and smothering them thereafter.As the first week at Barcelona showed, Samaranch is absolutely in the saddle, and the American presence is everywhere declining.  As recently as 1968, 20 percent of medals went to Americans.  By Seoul it was 13 percent, and the gold diffusion should continue here.  Money from Western corporations is flowing in to help the athletes in former Soviet-bloc countries.  Even poorer countries have increased funding for training.  That's not bad.Once, not so long ago, the Olympics were a model for the battle of military superpowers.  Today, for all the emphasis on money in the United States Postal Service Olympics, it's only appropriate that The Games seem to pattern themselves after the economic world, with the United States only first among equals.  Still, for all that historical symmetry, it'd be more fun if Fortress America yet had The Evil Empire left to try and beat on the Coca-Cola Olympic field of play.&nbsp;BASKETBALLThe Dream Team took no prisoners.

"BO knew football, alas. Bo has known baseball, and vows to know it again. And, of course, Bo knows advertising. Now, CBS is audaciously trying to convince viewers that Bo also knows enough about television to serve as a sort of critic.&quot;Bo Knows Shows&quot; is the theme of what CBS executives say is their first on-the-air promotional campaign featuring a celebrity spokesman who endorses the network's programming. The campaign, which will be introduced with teaser commercials tomorrow, stars Bo Jackson, the professional athlete who has been sidelined in his dual-sport career by a serious hip injury.&nbsp;The commercials, which will run on CBS through the fall, will begin in earnest on Tuesday, during CBS's telecast of the 1992 baseball All-Star Game. They are the latest in a flock of ads from the television networks to sell their series in the same manner that television advertisers sell soup, soap and soft drinks.CBS, which during the 1991-92 season leaped from third to first place in prime-time ratings, has been the most aggressive in adapting the tactics of packaged-goods marketing to broadcasting.&quot;Part of what we're selling is not CBS, but an attitude of leadership,&quot; George F. Schweitzer, senior vice president of CBS marketing and communications, said yesterday during an interview at CBS's headquarters in midtown Manhattan. &quot;And promotion plays a big role in that.&quot;He added: &quot;We have a saying, 'You are what you air.' People watch programs, not networks. But networks do have personalities.&quot;Joseph Abruzzese, senior vice president of network sales, said the campaign would enable CBS to tap into consumers' avid interest in Mr. Jackson's comeback attempts.&quot;People want to see him succeed,&quot; he said. And in advertising and media, as in sports, nothing succeeds like success.In its humorous tone and fast-paced style, the CBS campaign is evocative of, and derived from, Mr. Jackson's award-winning &quot;Bo Knows&quot; advertising forNikeInc., created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. CBS sought, and received, the blessings ofNikeand Wieden to follow in their footsteps; they even lent CBS Joe Pytka, the director of many ofNike'sbest-known spots.Nikeand Wieden also approved a commercial in the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; style, starring Mr. Jackson, that Ogilvy &amp; Mather Direct in New York created in 1990 for A.T.&amp; T.Such authorized homages are a shrewd strategy, according to Brian T. Murphy, editor and publisher of The Sports Marketing Letter in Westport, Conn.&quot;Nikehas a big investment in Bo,&quot; he said, &quot;so they have a real interest in trying to get value out of that relationship.&quot;Mr. Murphy believes Mr. Jackson is &quot;still a star&quot; in terms of endorsements, despite his inactivity.&quot;The potential is still there,&quot; he added. &quot;And one thing that must be remembered is that if he makes a comeback, and he excels, that would be one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of sports.&quot;And that would make him torridly hot.&quot;Torrid was an apt word for Mr. Jackson's ad career, which had soared since he appeared in his first &quot;Bo knows&quot;Nikecommercial in 1989. He then divided his ad work betweenNikeand other marketers like A.T.&amp; T. and Pepsi-Cola.After Mr. Jackson was injured playing football for the Los Angeles Raiders last year, there was speculation that his career as an endorser would be over. Instead, he has remained in the spotlight, in large part because of a hilariousNikecommercial last summer about his rehabilitation regimen to recover from his injury.That premise is also used by CBS. If Mr. Jackson is not playing sports, what is he doing? Working out in a bid to return to the Chicago White Sox -- and watching television.&quot;It'll be quite a while before Bo can hit or run or field like he used to,&quot; Mr. Jackson says in a teaser spot, using his characteristic third-person references to himself.Holding up a sign that says, &quot;Watch the All-Star Game on CBS,&quot; he adds, &quot;But Bo can still pitch.&quot;The funniest of the spots shows Mr. Jackson in his training room, doing one-armed push-ups as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; plays on a giant television set.&quot;Bo loves working out during '60 Minutes,' &quot; he says. &quot;When the show's over, Bo knows it's time to do push-ups with his other arm.&quot;The arrangement between CBS andNiketo use Mr. Jackson has no quid pro quo involving advertising, Mr. Abruzzese said, adding that CBS &quot;already has a big share of their sports advertising.&quot;Indeed, Mr. Jackson's CBS spots will share air time during the All-Star Game with Wieden's latest &quot;Bo Knows&quot; commercial forNike.Called &quot;Bo's Hip,&quot; it will contrast his active life with that of a typical viewer.&quot;What are you and your good hip doing right now?&quot; the spot asks. The answer: &quot;Watching commercials.&quot;",0.118287526427,0.449081345012,792 words,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;CBS Knows Bo Knows Its Viewers,1992-07-10 00:00:00,953 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The New York Times
"There's the rhythmic thump of a basketball on a gym floor and the whack . . . whack . . . whack of a tennis match. Tropical fish glide behind a clear wall while, elsewhere, a tennis racket personally ruined by John McEnroe is displayed.Then, of course, the shoes. Running shoes. Tennis shoes. Basketball shoes. Golf shoes. Hiking shoes. Wrestling shoes. Soccer shoes. Shoes that bristle with static energy, shoes that gleam under spotlights, flanked by racks of lycra clothing in neon and black.Sounds, sights - and products.Just Do It.&nbsp;This isNikeTown, America's new kid on the retailing block that blends '70s Disco decor, straight-up '80s consumerism with '90s marketing savvy into a virtual reality shopping experience aimed at people with bucks who like to hum when they cruise the aisles.Sounds, images, colors and computers converge here in a store devoted exclusively to sports and an atmosphere that puts the shopper in the starting block, on the 14th tee or slam-dunking with the scoreboard showing 112-111.Or reaching for their wallets and purses.Just Do It.&quot;A lot of people do like to shop and when they shop, atmosphere is important,&quot; says store manager Mary Burns, a mid-Westerner with a strong merchandising resume.Nearby, Tom and Donna Sunderland, up from Stockton, Calif., flip through the racks, their tanned faces glowing at the goods.&quot;This store,&quot; says Tom, &quot;is just the greatest.&quot;Adds Donna: &quot;I felt like jogging after being in here for only a few seconds. It really pumps you up.&quot;NikeTown, opened last November byNikeInc., is retail theatre, one of those things only the U.S. of A. would do, or want to do - meaning it's risky and expensive.But doubts that the entire exercise is just a doomed, dippy marketing balloon dissolve, somewhat, when Burns pulls out some figures.On a recent Saturday in August, 5,000 people went through the store. It has a capacity for 350 shoppers.She calculatesNikeTown draws at least 30,000 customers a week, or about 150,000 people a month.It opened Nov. 21, so let's say 1.5 million people to date have trooped through Town.That's 1.5 million through a store that is only 4,570 square metres (15,000 square feet).Lineups to get in here are not uncommon and the store has become a major tourist attraction for the city.&quot;It's finally put Portland on the map,&quot; declares Sandy Macomber, librarian at the Oregonian newspaper a few blocks away.Yesssssss!*NikeInc. was founded by Phil Knight (a middle distance runner) and Bill Bowerman (his coach). It is the biggest sports and fitness company in the U.S. with net profits in 1989 reaching $ 167 million. They've sold five million pairs of Air Pegasus, aNikerunning shoe, alone.NikeInc.'s world headquarters were established in the nearby Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1979.Nike(rhymes with Mikey) is the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh curve in the trademark was designed by a Portland State University student.Jimmie Connors won the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open wearingNikes. In 1983, Jean Benoit shattered the women's world marathon time wearingNikes. Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan made them a cult shoe.Nike, it follows, treats sports and shoes very, very seriously.&quot;A couple of years agoNikedecided that it wanted to build a store that would represent their collections or their sports categories the way they designed and developed them,&quot; says Burns.From the concept emerged the town - resist the temptation to call it Smelly Runnerville - a two-storey, 4,570-square-metre store in downtown Portland. For Lower Mainlanders, it is about a seven-hour drive south down the I-5.The idea ofNikeTown was to merchandise footwear, apparel and accessories - 95 per cent of what is in theNikecatalogue is on display in the store - not just to consumers, but to retailers as well.NikeTown, Burns said, was supposed to be fun and so unique in retail, &quot;that it was more than just a store.&quot;More than just a store.Let's say you want to buy a wet suit for sailboarding. AtNikeTown you stroll to the Aqua Gear pavilion, the name for each area selling a different sports product.Here, you see the tropical fish. At your feet, a multi-screen image - on the floor! you can walk on it! - depicts scenes of rippling water. The background music is the sound of rushing water, virtually real. You can hear the water, if not the cash register.&quot;The uniqueness of the atmos-phere of each sports category is felt when you walk in,&quot; says Burns.The products sit on a surfboard shelf. The salesperson will be a sailboarder, dressed in sports gear, who will push a few IBM computer buttons to check the inventory and order your purchase, which is delivered smoothly via large acrylic tubes from the basement.There is no disappearing act by the salesman to find the goods. They remain with the customer, discussing the product, signing them up for the next sailboarding competition or just chatting about the latest sports scores. It's called schmoozing.*Gordon Thompson was hired byNikeInc. as creative director ofNikeTown. For inspiration, he visited the stage set of the movie Back to the Future, which based a lot of its action around a town square. He'd also visited many older European towns. Ditto, town squares.Thus,NikeTown includes maybe a dozen pavilions linked by a common area, an elevator and a catwalk. A two-storey town was born. The entrance and passageway lighting was kept Nightclub Dark, with each pavilion becoming an oasis of bright lights, a palette of color and products - moving the shopper from dark to light. Get it?In addition to the merchandise, the layout and the sound track, a museum element was introduced to entice shoppers.They can gaze at a basketball signed by Michael Jordan or Nolan &quot;Tex&quot; Ryan's shoes and hat. Sports heros like Bo Jackson or the Portland Blazers visit the store to autograph equipment or offer advice, all adding to the sports aura, all bringing shoppers through the door.DevelopingNikeTown as an &quot;event&quot; rather than a retail centre carried the risk that people will look, rather than buy. It was a risk thatNike, competing with the likes of Adidas, Reeboks, LA Gear and Brooks, could accept.Says Burns: &quot;We didn't know on day one when we opened if there would be a line of people at the door. We didn't know if people would find it interesting. But the first two weeks we had lines a block long to get in the store. We couldn't get everybody in.&quot;Right now I would say that every Sunday morning now, there are at least 70 people outside the front door, waiting to get in. It's amazing. We are a tourist attraction, people bring their cameras to take pictures.&quot;Nikewon't release any sales or dollar figures, but Burns says, &quot;we are definitely meeting our expectations in that area.&quot;One indication thatNikeTown is approaching black ink came when the company announced it will open anotherNikeTown in Chicago, a 50,000-square-foot store, next May and plans additionalNikeTowns for New York and Europe.Less enthusiastic about such retail theatre is Toronto retailing analyst John Winter.&quot;You have to realize that the sports shoe market has become very competitive. IfNikecan get an edge by selling through an attractive outlet. That's fine. If you can get an edge, it's fine for a year or two. Concept retailers have a very short shelf life.&quot;There's a lot of distractions, from salesgirls wearing shorts to music and atmosphere and all that. They all detract from the fact that it's $ 150 US you're paying for shoes made in the Phillipines by someone paid 75 cents an hour.&quot;But it's merchandising. Brilliant merchandising.&quot;*NikeTown is also aimed at retailers who visit the store to draw ideas from the racking, the presentation and the concept they can then apply to their own stores.Nikedoesn't advertiseNikeTown, relying on word-of-mouth and media stories to do the rest after it trumpeted the official opening.&quot;The main reason is other retailers sellNikeproducts too and our intention is not to compete with them but to help and enhance the business totally. If Footlocker or Nordstrom wants to run the same product we have at 20 (per cent) off, that's good, that's okay, that's their business. We're here just to enhance whatNikeis all about,&quot; says Burns.&quot;Is this the wave of the future? Well, it's a combination of design and merchandising, but also service. We've heard that over and over again. We went from a very service-oriented retail environment many years ago to self- service to 'wait a minute, people still really want service' especially with price points and technical products, they deserve to know why this costs what it costs and in order to do that, you have to service the customer.&quot;Make no mistake,NikeTown is aimed squarely at middle and upper-income campers who don't flinch at a $ 360 US price tag for a Goretex running suit or at $ 225 US Air Super Dome AC6 hiking boots or $ 150 US Air Force 180 basketball runners.Nikecontinues to operate a factory outlet seven kilometres away fromNikeTown, where prices are 20 to 30 per cent lower.NikeTown, says Burns, is for the customer, &quot;who wants the atmosphere, wants the design and wants to be able to say, 'I bought it atNikeTown.' &quot;Heather Shannon, director of retailing for Ernst Young in Vancouver, observes thatNikeTown typifies the polarization of retail stores in North America into either discount, bare bones-type stores or high end, service-oriented, experience-oriented outlets.&quot;It fits in well with that as an over-all trend,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;And as far as demographics are concerned, people are demanding more from retailers and expecting more. As we age we get crankier and more demanding.&quot;*If you buy it atNikeTown, you may buy it from Ethan Egan, a twentysomething salesman and former Nordstrom salesman who jumped at the chance to work atNike.&quot;I went toNikeclasses in product knowledge before the store opened so we were all primed for opening day,&quot; says Egan, who pointed out the store's features during a stroll through each pavilion.He jogs and plays soccer, skills that he uses daily in talking to customers. &quot;I love it here,&quot; he says.GRAPHIC:&nbsp;CONCEPT RETAILERS: 'There's lots of distractions'PUMPED UP: Sounds, images, colors converge in total-sports storeNikerunning shoe",0.159520622312,0.437183345242,1722 words,NikeTown is retail theatre U.S.A.: A running start:NIKE:store aimed at middle and upper-income campers,1991-09-21 00:00:00,956 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)
"WHILE the rest of the world is watching the Olympics, Steven Nichols has his sights on the United States Open tennis tournament later this summer.As president and chief executive of K-Swiss Inc., maker of classic white-on-white leather tennis shoes favored by preppies and college freshmen, Mr. Nichols is sitting the Olympics out, determined not to stage a footwear industry version of the basketball game between the United States Dream Team and Angola.&nbsp;&quot;We'll probably sell twice as many shoes in our booth at the U.S. Open as eitherNikeor Reebok,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;That's our territory. That's what we're good at.&quot;K-Swiss is a company known for sticking to its knitting. Between 1966, when the company was founded by Swiss brothers who were World Cup skiers, and 1987, K-Swiss made only that classic white tennis shoe, crafted from three pieces of leather, metal rings for lacing and a heavy, durable rubber sole.Although Mr. Nichols has been introducing canvas shoes, children's shoes, and shoes for walking, hiking and basketball since he and some investors bought K-Swiss in a leveraged buyout in 1987, it has never developed the sexy image cultivated by most growth companies hyped by Wall Street.Even its double-digit increases in earnings fail to impress the analysts, who useNikeand Reebok as yardsticks. &quot;Over all, they're up about 18 percent in the second quarter,&quot; said Gary M. Jacobson, a footwear analyst at Kidder, Peabody. &quot;That's O.K., but it's not anything to get excited about.&quot;In comparison, he noted,Nike'ssecond-quarter profits rose 20 percent. K-Swiss closed yesterday at $18.00, down 75 cents, in over-the-counter trading. Its price-earnings ratio is about 12;Nike'sis about 17.While most analysts expect K-Swiss to earn about $1.50 a share this year, a 12 percent increase over last year, much of the gain will come from a more favorable tax rate and lower interest payments. The company's minuscule size in comparison to aNikeor an L.A. Gear can present problems in its dealing with overseas factories, which may produce for all three companies.K-Swiss's relative lack of clout with its suppliers, in fact, has hampered distribution recently, according to analysts.&quot;At a slightly lower price, this is an attractive growth company,&quot; said Alice A. Ruth, a footwear analyst with Montgomery Securities. &quot;But they're small, and that has great disadvantages in this business.&quot;The comparisons are frustrating to Mr. Nichols. With an advertising and promotional budget this year that is less than one-tenth the size ofNike'sand one-twentieth that of Reebok, K-Swiss does not even try to contend with the industry's Goliaths. Together the two shoe giants control more than 50 percent of the $5.5 billion-plus domestic market for athletic shoes; K-Swiss has about 1.7 percent.Instead, the company's sit-it-out strategy is a textbook example of niche marketing.&quot;The world doesn't need anotherNikeor Reebok,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;It has two spectacular ones already.&quot;K-Swiss deliberately aims at the blue-blooded end of the athletic shoe market, leavingNikeand Reebok to contend for the huge -- and fickle -- teen-age and fashion set. K-Swiss's Surf and Turf nautical shoe, a canvas version of its classic leather tennis shoe that sells for about $35, was the official shoe for the America's Cup this year.Its first television advertising was shot in gritty black-and-white film with arias from &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; as background music. And at $75 and $85 a pair its Si-18 tennis shoe is a best seller, thanks in part to tennis-playing matrons in places like Greenwich, Conn.; La Jolla, Calif., and Chicago's North Shore. &quot;If it's upscale and snooty, that's just where we want to be,&quot; Mr. Nichols said.While the company's refusal to get into high-tech, neon-encrusted athletic shoes frustrates many analysts, it protects K-Swiss and its retailers from the vicissitudes of fashion.Nikeand Reebok change styles every few months, dictating demand by building in obsolescence.That strategy means retailers may have to cut prices on old inventory, which puts pressure on their profit margins. K-Swiss's shoes rarely change, which, Mr. Nichols contends, means shoppers and retailers get a better value because K-Swiss prices are rarely marked down. A pair of men's Classics sells for about $55.&quot;Every once in a while we'll miss a little trend like neon or buckles and Velcro on the uppers,&quot; he concedes. &quot;But our retailers know there's not a new innovation coming down the pike that is going to make their inventory worthless.&quot;Eschewing fashion also means a smoother manufacturing cycle. In the first month of production of a newly designed shoe, about 25 percent of the output is defective, Mr. Nichols said. It takes about three months for a factory to get the process right.Sales of K-Swiss shoes abroad grew 57 percent last year, and Mr. Nichols sees good growth opportunities in Europe and Japan, where the Classic has become a best seller.&quot;We're putting down stakes in territory we can be very good on,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;Someday, we'll have a stake at the Olympics, too.&quot;",0.189783490644,0.421223712535,859 words,Market Place;Athletic Shoes Without the Fads,1992-08-06 00:00:00,958 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The New York Times
"Reprinted from The Economist, a magazine published by Economist&nbsp;Newspaper Ltd. of London.New York, it was once said, has Jews, Italians and Irish, so New&nbsp;York is manic, brassy and exciting. Chicago has Poles, Croats and&nbsp;Slovaks, so Chicago is sullen, defeated and oppressed.But that was before Eastern Europe won its freedom; and before&nbsp;Michael Jordan, too.&nbsp;Jordan, 28, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the&nbsp;intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he&nbsp;does things that make you gasp.Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player&nbsp;ever to grace the court. George Will, a conservative columnist, has&nbsp;suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-&nbsp;denomination bank notes.In previous years, Jordan has had to play on a Chicago Bulls team&nbsp;that collapsed when the going got tough - and in the National Basketball&nbsp;Association's playoffs, the going gets very tough indeed.This year, however, the Bulls have swept all before them. Last week&nbsp;they completed a four-game rout of the Detroit Pistons - champions the&nbsp;past two years - in the NBA semifinals. This week they will play for the&nbsp;championship. Winning a championship ring would be the culmination of&nbsp;Jordan's career.Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is&nbsp;dominated by blacks. Since to play professional basketball at all you&nbsp;need great discipline, and to play it at Jordan's level you need&nbsp;extraordinary flair and imagination, it is hardly surprising that the&nbsp;great search for &quot;role models&quot; for black children should have fastened on&nbsp;the Bulls' star. Since Jordan is intelligent and articulate, notable for&nbsp;good sportsmanship and devoted to charitable work (though without ever&nbsp;seeming cloyingly goody-goody about it), he is an obvious choice.There is, however, a catch - two catches, actually. The first is&nbsp;Jordan's association withNike, America's leading maker of sneakers.&nbsp;Jordan has been endorsingNikeproducts since 1984: The Air Jordan shoe&nbsp;isNike'sbest-selling line. He is not alone; other black heroes, like&nbsp;filmmaker Spike Lee and John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown&nbsp;University, also endorseNikeproducts.What is wrong with that? According to Jesse Jackson, black America's&nbsp;most popular politician and a basketball fan, a lot.Nike, he argues, is&nbsp;promoting an &quot;ethos of mindless materialism&quot; by encouraging black&nbsp;children to buy sneakers (the latest Air Jordans cost $ 125) that they&nbsp;cannot afford. That sounds like killjoyism taken to the limit, but&nbsp;Jackson has a point.It is not as if inner-city children buy just one pair of sneakers;&nbsp;the pressure from the street is to keep up with the latest fashions. Some&nbsp;youngsters own as many as 50 pairs of sneakers; one 14-year-old boy told&nbsp;The Washington Post that he spent $ 2,000 a year on shoes.; Sneakers used as lureYou do not need to be a genius to work out one of the most likely&nbsp;ways in which some inner-city youngsters come by such sums: It is by&nbsp;selling drugs. Some drug dealers use sneakers as a way of recruiting&nbsp;youngsters to their gangs; some gangs identify themselves by the sneakers&nbsp;they wear, or accept stolen sneakers as payment for drugs. There have&nbsp;even been incidents in which people have been murdered for their high-&nbsp;fashion basketball shoes.Nike, to be fair, makes sure that its role-model endorsers like&nbsp;Jordan appear in advertisements warning kids off drugs and encouraging&nbsp;them to stay in school. But Jackson is entitled to wonder whether those&nbsp;messages are as strong as the ones coming from the street.The bigger catch is in the very idea of role models. Behind the&nbsp;search for role models lies the assumption that only great men such as&nbsp;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X or Jordan himself are worthy of&nbsp;emulation. When those idols are found to have feet of clay - and everyone&nbsp;who draws breath does - the pain of disenchantment can be profound.; Parents best role modelsJordan knows the pressure that role-modeling puts on him: &quot;I'm not a&nbsp;perfect person,&quot; he has said. He agrees with Charles Barkley, another NBA&nbsp;star, that the most useful role models for children are not heroes like&nbsp;himself but their parents.There is another drawback to role models. The majority of children&nbsp;have no chance of fame on the basketball court, or anywhere else. The&nbsp;veneration of sportsmen subtly denigrates more mundane but realistic&nbsp;goals - like getting a steady job.What blacks need is not supermen but economic opportunity; and, as&nbsp;two recent sets of studies by the Brookings Institution and the Urban&nbsp;Institute have shown (as if the point needed laboring), anyone who thinks&nbsp;that they have such opportunity in the same measure as whites is deluding&nbsp;himself.None of this should be taken as an excuse to denigrate Jordan's&nbsp;talent. But it is a shame that America's obsession with sports means that&nbsp;his kind of talent is celebrated more than that of other men and women.As the city prepared for the NBA Finals, Chicago magazine ran an&nbsp;article on Cyrus Colter, who in his long life has been one of Chicago's&nbsp;leading black lawyers, academics and public servants, and who, when most&nbsp;men would have put on the slippers, took to writing award-winning novels,&nbsp;short stories and poems.

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Baseball and football star Bo Jackson delighted a group of high school journalists yesterday stories about his rise to fame and comments on his career.Jackson held a news conference for the students atNikeTown, the new shoe store opened last fall byNikeInc., one of Jackson's advertising employers.&nbsp;Jackson continually spoke with wonder about how a poor boy from rural Alabama could grow up and become a rich, famous man. &quot;A nappy-headed kid who threw rocks better than some people could shoot a gun,&quot; is how Jackson described himself then, and a family man who loves children is how he sees himself now.A charmerWith two of his own children watching from a balcony above, Jackson charmed the group with an easy demeanor - a contrast to his sometimes shy and surly dealings with professional media.Jackson walked in toNikeTown wearing an earring and a sweatsuit. As soon as he started joking about the &quot;nice, sunny city of Portland,&quot; he put the students at ease.When asked to introduce his family, Jackson said his oldest son was nicknamed &quot;Spud,&quot; his younger son was &quot;a human tornado,&quot; and his infant daughter decided herself not to fly to Portland because of an ear infection.Jackson's humor continually broke through a deadpan delivery and a grave expression. A student asked what Jackson wanted to be remembered for, and the response was a furrowed brow, a glare and a mock-serious:&quot;Am I going anywhere I should know about?&quot;Some of the questions were facile:Which is Jackson's favorite TV commercial?&quot;The last one I did, the multisport Jackson. They wedged me in that sports car, and it took three people to pull me out. The Indy 500 is not in my future.&quot;Some were serious:What about the use of steroids in sports?&quot;I don't know anything about that. I would not know what a steroid is if you came up here and smacked me in the face with it. Go ask (sprinter) Ben Johnson about that. Bo don't know steroids.&quot;Enjoys his workAnd some were obvious:Which sport do you enjoy more, football or baseball?&quot;You wouldn't believe how many times I've been asked that. I enjoy my work as far as the business aspect goes.

"In recent summers, men have headed to the beach clad in snug bikini trunks, feet bare or shod in loose-fitting flip-flops. But in the summer of 1991, snug trunks are outnumbered by loose-fitting briefs. And it's the new beach shoes of choice that are worn snug.Nike'sAqua Gear collection of coordinated swimwear and water sport shoes has kept fashion and sales pace with the increased popularity of sports like wind surfing and wave running (the latter refers to riding a water vehicle that looks like a snowmobile). These sports call for steady footing and, of course, the pulled-together bearing that matching shorts and shoes imply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike'sAqua Socks, actually slip-on shoes, consist of neoprene soles with treads, built-in arch support and reinforced toes and molded heels, with ankle-high uppers of an airy spandex mesh in flashy neon colors.This summer, they're not worn just by the sports-minded.Aqua Socks protect feet from hot sand, sharp shells and glass, and give traction on mucky lake bottoms and slippery rocks. In Central Park, they're worn by young men scaling the outcroppings on mountain bikes.They have caught on at health clubs, especially in aqua aerobics classes, and in locker rooms, to prevent foot infections. And they're comfortable. A man in a business suit was recently spotted wearing a pair while walking along Park Avenue.&quot;I am constantly sold out,&quot; Robert Ottofaro, owner of Panda Sport, 311 77th Street in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, said of Aqua Socks. &quot;The foot can't breathe in most activewear shoes,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;your feet do not get fatigued, as in flip-flops, where there is no support.&quot;Baby Aqua Socks, in sizes 2 through 8, and youth and junior sizes are $25; adult Aqua Socks are $29; Aqua Socks, Too -- with a Velcro closure over the instep for extra support -- are $35. All come in vivid color combinations that complementNike'sequally colorful Aqua Shorts, in wave-textured nylon taffeta, $36. A Du Pont Coolmax liner wicks away perspiration, and mesh pockets allow drainage. Aqua Gear is sold at Paragon Sporting Goods, 867 Broadway (18th Street) and at Foot Locker stores around the New York region.Speedo America also makes a popular beach shoe and nylon swim shorts. The shorts come in 15-, 16- and 17-inch lengths, with mesh pockets and drawstring waistbands, in a variety of colors and prints. All are $36 at Paragon, Macy's, A. &amp; S., Bloomingdale's and the six Herman's World of Sporting Goods stores in Manhattan.Speedo's Surf Walker comes in high- and low-top versions, for children and adults. The high top comes in black or turquoise, $40. The ankle-high slipper comes in two-tone black and turquoise or black and yellow, $34. Children's sizes start at 12.The high-top Surf Walker is somewhat denser and more structured than Aqua Socks and offers less ventilation. A popular boating shoe, it offers support and durability. The molded insole is removable for easy cleaning.GRAPHIC:Photos: Speedo's Surf Walker, with spandex mesh upper, nubbed sole and ankle and instep support, $40.;NikeAqua Shorts, $36, come in colors to complement their Aqua Socks.; Aqua Socks, $25-$35, come in neon-colored spandex mesh, with treaded neoprene soles.

"Charles Barkley, who behaved himself relatively well during the U.S. men's basketball game against Germany on Wednesday night (he only confronted a referee once), said he plans to attend some of the women's games in a show of support. A frequent spectator at the women's games at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, where the 76ers have practiced for years, Barkley planned to urge several of his teammates to accompany him.&quot;It's so typical,&quot; Barkley said. &quot;They don't support women's sports enough in America. They support the men, but not the women.&quot;&nbsp;Asked whether he planned to attend the women's 11 a.m. opener against Czechoslovakia, he hedged. &quot;Uh, I heard Czechoslovakia's not too good. I may wait until they get farther along.&quot;They hate four-year waitsOf the 12 U.S. women's players, 11 play professionally overseas. The 12th, Suzie McConnell, retired to have a baby. Women's pro basketball has failed in the United States and the American women aren't thrilled about having to wait every four years for an American audience. &quot;I don't know what's special, besides wearing the red, white and blue,&quot; says three-time Olympian Teresa Edwards, who plays in Japan. &quot;We go overseas to make our living and we come back and represent the country for nothing, you know? We don't get enough credit for that. The Japanese people feed me. Nobody in the U.S. feeds me. I don't make a penny here.&quot;Needed: ideal scrimmagesLynn Barry, vice-president of USA Basketball, said an ideal scrimmaging opponent for the women's Olympic team would be a boys' high school team - if they could check their egos at the gym entrance. &quot;The problem is that they can't handle being beaten by the girls,&quot; said Barry, &quot;and if they start playing too hard, we could get hurt. A perfect combination would be high school boys with college players' mentalities.&quot;Warmup war continuesBoth sides are taking hard-line positions in a dispute between the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. basketball team over what to wear at medal ceremonies. Reebok has a contract with the USOC that all medal winners will wear a specially designed Reebok warmup suit after winning an Olympic medal. But Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, both of whom are under contract toNike, are outspoken in their desire not to wear the Reebok suit. Scottie Pippen, Chris Mullin, John Stockton and David Robinson also are U.S. players under contract toNike. The USOC said no athlete who is not wearing this suit will appear in a ceremony.

"It is a rare bird these days who will talk about advertising without cant or pseudo-profundity, but they do exist. And when they speak, as British adman Tim Delaney did recently to Strategy, it is wise to pay attention.Delaney, in Toronto recently to speak during the Newspaper Marketing Bureau's Extra Awards gala, is no seer, as he would be the first to admit. But he does have clearly thought out opinions about where he thinks advertising is heading and where this half-art, half-science will end up.&nbsp;The venerable British creative director and founder of his own shop, Leagas Delaney, is convinced massive change is coming to the advertising business, whether in Europe, North America or elsewhere. And so massive is this change, Delaney sees parallels between that and the crumbling of the state regimes in the former Soviet Union and its satellites. The communist-militarist dictatorships of Eastern Europe could no longer sustain their bureaucracies, their superstructures, Delaney says. So, too, with multinational advertising agencies and their enormous fixed overheads.Delaney predicts the globe-girdling juggernauts of the business will falter and bring down with them their various adjuncts such as media shops and research houses. When or where this will occur remains problematic, Delaney says, but it is coming and could return advertising to the three-people-to-a-shop cottage industry it once was. Clients, Delaney says to emphasize his point, will only pay agencies to make advertising.Delaney's outlook is not simplistic, nor is it apocalyptic. A cursory examination of business in Canada today reveals the companies that are surviving the second economic depression in 60 years are mostly small, nimble and fat-free. Why should advertising be any different?Delaney is on equally stimulating, but less firm, ground with his tacit approval of what he calls the coming of &quot;neo-imperialism&quot; in advertising. As an illustration, Delaney uses the example of theNikeathletic equipment trademark. Advertising creative is approved in Oregon,Nike'sheadquarters, and used around the world. If consumers in France or Germany or Australia respond to it then they are &quot;Nikepeople&quot; and may buy the company's products. But if other consumers in Sweden or Spain or Brazil do not respond to the same ad they are notNikepeople and so beyond this athletic shoe's pale.Canadian ad agencies might find Delaney's prediction of a coming neo-imperialism at odds with his earlier suggestion that small shops are the future. His reasonable views on the breakup of the multinationals might leave them wondering where the power to back this neo-imperialism will come from if not from the multinational agencies. Delaney would counter that technology has levelled the playing field, giving even the smallest of agencies ready access to the new neo-imperialist market.Whether Delaney's predictions are right or wrong, time, of course, will tell. But for those agencies blinking out at North America and beyond from agency centres across Canada, it is heartening to be reminded once again that new opportunities are unfolding, and that the basis for successful advertising continues to be nothing more complicated than clear thinking.",0.0832095303686,0.480121835235,542 words,Editorial One man's view,1992-11-02 00:00:00,975 of 998 DOCUMENTS,Strategy
"Michael Jordan was talking about Dominique Wilkins, and the words weren't friendly.''I know what he's doing,'' Jordan said suspiciously before the NBA All- Star Game. ''When someone's on top of you, you try to knock him off. But I'm going to take a Carolina approach, and keep it clean, and stay on top.''&nbsp;What exactly had 'Nique been doing to Jordan? Body slams in the lane? Submarining him on layups?No, Wilkins had committed the sin that has been forbidden since Elvis warned the world not to step on his blue suede shoes.Wilkins is among the Reebok crew of ''pump up'' endorsers who have been needlingNikeon television ads. Air bags vs. Air Jordan.Nikehas threatened to take legal action against Reebok's leapers, a case made for a kangaroo court if ever there was one.What is it about shoes that breeds such hostility?They have been a source of easily injured pride dating to when ''Your mother wears combat boots'' still was an insult. For all her faults, what really bugged us about Imelda Marcos was her warehouse full of shoes. And those who like to tweak Nevada-Las Vegas about its courtside seats filled with high-rollers always snidely refer to it as ''Gucci Row.''Boston's Dee Brown kicked the shoe confrontation up a notch Saturday, when he paused before each of his attempts in the dunk contest to pump up his Reeboks. Dee-bok swears it was his idea, and maybe so, but somewhere a commercial is being filmed of the newly crowned slam champ.But maybe Reebok should be worried. Playgrounds are on the verge of becoming pumpatoriums. The inevitable peer pressure could lead to a new kind of game of chicken, to see who can take the most pumps. Watch out for the injury of the '90s: ankle strangulation.It's amazing how far we've come from the days when there truly was only one shoe a dignified athlete could wear. The Converse Chuck Taylor model came only in white and black. Why they bothered to have the black model was a mystery, because only the Celtics wore them and they made even the world champs look dorky.Then came the major breakthrough in the '60s. Someone in the back shop let a pair of scissors slip, and thus the low-cut was born. Wow. Two styles. This is like when Baskin-Robbins served only chocolate and vanilla.TodayNikeand Reebok are at the same kind of odds as Coke and Pepsi. One wonders how much ofNike'sjealousy has to do with the Laker Girls' collective bustline being turned into a Reebok billboard. Or that infamous but quickly pulled ad with the bungee-cord jumpers, where the Reebok-shorn guy survives but the kid clad inNikesdisappears into the abyss (kind of like going to the Sacramento Kings).Shoe battles aren't new. The first two companies to go at it - adidas and Puma - were run by German brothers named Dassler who carried on a lifelong feud.And the stakes are high, as L.A. Gear learned when it suffered a public relations disaster in December. Marquette freshman Robb Logterman drove the lane at Kansas, only to suffer a blowout the likes of which even Goodyear seldom sees. His shoe simply fell apart, and left behind in the paint was Logterman's filet of sole.It turned out Marquette was going through its L.A. Gear (Joe Montana's brand) by the gross, and within the month the Warriors switched toNike.Nikealso got the last word before All-Star weekend ended, as Jordan got a foothold on revenge.In Sunday's All-Star Game, Wilkins blew the opportunity to become the all- time ham of slam. With no defender near, Wilkins went up for one of the from- the-hip, over-the-shoulder power dunks that he invented, only to miss. This is what's called an air dunk.After seeing Wilkins suffer the ultimate showtime embarrassment, Jordan issued an epitaph for the times: ''He forgot to pump up.''",0.0983612440191,0.536007822587,633 words,COMMENTARY;New shoe motto: Don't tread on me,1991-02-13 00:00:00,976 of 998 DOCUMENTS,USA TODAY
"Until Alejandro Pena works out his problems on the mound, the Atlanta Braves will turn to Marvin Freeman and Mike Stanton more often in the closer's role, despite Freeman's blown save Thursday night.Pena has blown two save opportunities and given up the winning run three times in his last four appearances.&nbsp;&quot;We'll move it around until some things straighten out,&quot; said manager Bobby Cox.Freeman inherited a 3-2 lead and a base-loaded situation in the ninth Thursday, then gave up a two-run single to Pittsburgh's Jeff King as the Pirates rallied for a 4-3 win.That won't change his plan, Cox said. &quot;I thought Marvin pitched well. His pitch to King was a jam shot and it found the right hole. Then he comes back and strikes out the next two guys.&quot;Freeman had two saves in his previous two opportunities.

"For some beachcombers, it was a gift from the sea: hundreds of pairs ofNikeshoes that floated on to Pacific Northwest beaches.But for oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, the veritable school of shoes offers a chance to study a scientific wonder: the circulation of the Pacific Ocean - circulation that, over thousands of years, has influenced climate, tribal migration, oil spills and where drowning victims wash ashore.It was one of the oddest marine mishaps of the decade. On May 27, 1990, a freighter in the North Pacific encountered a storm. Numerous containers fell overboard and broke open, dumping 80,000 athletic shoes, boots and golf shoes into the drink.&nbsp;Seven months later, the first shoes drifted on to North American beaches. Beachcombers recovered about 100 shoes on the western side of Vancouver Island. On March 26, 1991, 250 were found on the coast of southern Alaska. By May, hundreds more had been found as far south as Oregon.About 1,300 shoes have been recovered to date, says Ebbesmeyer, of Evans-Hamilton Inc., a consulting-oceanography firm in Seattle.&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if more start to come to shore. But some might drift in different directions - say, to Hawaii or Indonesia. They might continue floating out there for years,&quot; said Ebbesmeyer.Many beachcombers scrubbed salt and barnacles off the shoes, dried them out and discovered them to be snug fits. They held swap meets to exchange shoe sizes.&quot;I got about 140 pairs ofNikesand another 60 pairs of golf shoes by Etonic,&quot; said Steve McLeod, 47, of Cannon Beach, Ore. &quot;I have about 16 pairs that fit me, and I've shoed my entire family.&quot;The shoe spill intrigued Ebbesmeyer, who tracks ocean debris to better understand Pacific circulation.The Pacific isn't simply a big basin of salt water - it's a realm of constantly circulating &quot;rivers&quot; of water. Some spiral endlessly; others slosh back and forth from the chill waters of the north to the warmer waters of the south. Changes of temperature, season, salinity and tides influence ocean circulation.Using information gathered from coastal dwellers, Ebbesmeyer is developing a map showing where and when shoes reached land. So far, his findings pretty well match the accepted behavior of Pacific currents.Based on the movements, he calculates the shoes could have moved eastward at an average speed of 6.5 km a day, assuming they moved in a straight line.However, they probably first travelled in a loop in the Gulf of Alaska, then moved toward North America. The &quot;loop&quot; would have added 2,900 km to their journey. Hence, their true speed of travel could be closer to 16 km a day.",0.0922413793103,0.430172413793,444 words,Oceanographer tracks the greatNikeshoe spill,1992-03-14 00:00:00,984 of 998 DOCUMENTS,"The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)"
"The white stretch Lincoln was a 10-yard completion, the front bumper to its open trunk. It was a prime-time kind of ride waiting in front of the AtlantaFalcons team buses on a hot October afternoon at Joe Robbie Stadium. Asecurity man wearing a headset guarded the limo.Inside the Falcons' locker room, Deion Sanders was stretched out on atraining table, lying flat on his back, with a needle stuck in his arm and an intravenous bottle hanging from the ceiling over his head.&nbsp;This is what it had come to. Deion with a doctor squeezing the last drops from the plastic bag into his arm.&quot;He just wants to make that game,&quot; said team physician Charles Harrison.At 4:50 p.m., Deion got up off the training table, put on hisNikehat andNikeT-shirt andNikesandals, threw on a pair of black shades, and startedmaking his way to the limo, limping every step of the way. It wasn't that hewas too tired to talk. He had a plane to catch.Actually he had a limo to catch.And then a helicopter to catch.And then a plane to catch out of Opa-locka Airport for a 2 hour, 20-minute flight to Pittsburgh for Game 5 of the National League Championship Series.The door closed on his limo at 4:52. The helicopter was waiting in theparking lot on the west side of JRS. It was airborne a little after 5 o'clock, approximately 12 hours after Sanders checked into the Falcons' team hotel in Fort Lauderdale Sunday morning.&quot;You have to really look at, if it was you in that situation, what would you do?&quot; said Bobby Butler, the 12-year veteran from Delray Beach and Florida State. &quot;Every athlete here would do the same thing.&quot;GETTING HIS PROPERSIf you think this sideshow distracted the Falcons in their pursuit ofvictory against the Dolphins, you're wrong. Sanders hasn't set foot on theteam's training facility in Suwanee, Ga., since the Monday after the Green Bay game. That was Sept. 28-- 14 days ago.Yet he has enough natural ability to go out on a field where the headindex was in triple digits and play every down at cornerback, two at widereceiver, and seven as a kick returner. He made three tackles, all of themafter pass completions to Mark Duper.&quot;I have a new-found respect for the guy pulling something like thatoff,&quot; said Tim McKyer, the former Dolphin who plays on the opposite corner.&quot;It says a lot about Deion. It says a lot about how he feels about thegame.&quot;We really appreciate him coming out here and doing it for us.&quot;Was Sanders doing it for &quot;us&quot;-- the Falcons? Or was he doing it forDeion-- andNike? Those are the big questions surrounding this &quot;Play Two&quot;circus that redefined the old Ernie Banks quote.Sanders made $118,000 in Falcons' pay by showing up for Game 6 of theirNFL season. It also was a made-for-TV publicity stunt that is camera-ready for aNikecommercial. The only character missing was Spike Lee.&quot;He asked us to help him,&quot; said Anne Scearce ofNikeSports Management.&quot;We'd do anything we can to help Deion with his career goals.&quot;And just what are those? It's hard to tell because one day Sanders wants to be a pro baseball player, the next day he wants to be a pro footballplayer, and on Sunday, he wanted to be both.It doesn't seem to bother the Falcons. It's the Braves who are calling it a &quot;distraction.&quot;&quot;What goes unnoticed about him?&quot; wondered coach Jerry Glanville in theFalcons locker room. &quot;Everyone notices his athletic ability, everyone notices his God-given talent. But what's inside of him, how much he cares, is evenbigger than his ability.&quot;NOTHING SPECTACULARHis heart may be the size of his ego, but Sanders' game was justaverage. He didn't strike out twice on six pitches, which he's done in theNLCS. But he was flagged for one pass interference penalty and he had a second flag put back in the back judge's pocket when it was ruled that Dan Marino'spass to Duper was not catchable.&quot;They went out of their way to call it on Deion,&quot; Andre Rison said.The Dolphins went out of their way to test Sanders early. Marino's first play of the game was a deep out to Duper that sailed incomplete. Sanders wasnever burned, other than the 47-yard pass interference penalty, which didn'tcost the Falcons any points.On offense, he caught a flanker screen and ran for a 9-yard gain in thesecond quarter. On the last play before the half, he ran down the field under Chris Miller's Hail Mary pass that landed out of bounds.By the second half, it was obvious the heat was getting to him. Hestopped going to the Falcons' defensive huddles and his limp became morenoticeable. No plays from this game will make any of Deion's highlight films. Yet it was a statement not only to Deion's marketability, but his ability asan athlete.Bo may know, but Deion is the show.DEION'S DAYSome of the highlights of Deion Sanders' same-day, different-city, two-sport doubleheader.* 12:18 a.m. Sunday in Pittsburgh-- Sanders, wearing sunglasses andoutlined by the klieg lights of a dozen TV cameras, climbs into a stretchlimousine outside Three Rivers Stadium after playing two innings in left field and striking out in his only at-bat in the Atlanta Braves' 6-4 win over thePittsburgh Pirates in Game 4 of the National League playoffs.* 12:58 a.m. in West Mifflin, Pa.-- Sanders and his entourage board achartered Canadair CL601 jet at Allegheny County Airport in nearby WestMifflin, Pa., for 2-hour, 20-minute flight to Fort Lauderdale.

"In the never-ending race for the sneaker-buying public's hearts and feet, Converse Inc. has just been left flat-footed.Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, the basketball megastar, ubiquitous pitchman and AIDS activist, said yesterday that he was walking away from Converse, the athletic-shoe company that he has served as an endorser for the past 13 years. His departure was accompanied by a parting shot: Converse, Magic Johnson admonished, had misunderstood the rules of modern sneaker salesmanship by failing to make the most of ... Magic Johnson.&quot;Converse is still living in the 1960s and '70s,&quot; Johnson told the Associated Press after a U.S. Olympic basketball team practice in Monaco yesterday. &quot;They haven't arrived in the '80s and '90s where advertising and marketing are the keys.&quot;&nbsp;Johnson's announcement was a bombshell to those involved in the $ 12 billion-a-year sneaker business -- including Converse, which expressed &quot;surprise and shock&quot; at the news. The reaction underscored a basic tenet of the business: Athletic shoes, and basketball shoes in particular, live and die on the strength of superstar endorsers like Johnson, Michael Jordan and David Robinson.Several sports marketing specialists said yesterday that Johnson's criticism was on target. They said Converse, in a battle for basketball-shoe supremacy withNikeInc., Reebok International Ltd. and L.A. Gear Inc., had booted an opportunity to raise its profile by boosting Johnson's.&quot;When you get an athlete on his level, it's not just dollars alone that's important,&quot; said Stephen Disson, president of the D&amp;F Group, a Washington firm that develops sports events for corporate sponsors. &quot;It's extremely critical to them how they are used in TV and print advertising. I'm sure Magic sees whatNikeis doing with Michael Jordan. [Johnson] isn't jealous, he's just saying, 'This is how [a corporation] should use an athlete.' &quot;Once the preeminent basketball shoe marketer with its classic-but-clunky Chuck Taylor All-Star line, Converse has been under siege in recent years.Nikeand Reebok, in particular, have waged high-profile ad campaigns for their Air Jordan and Pump models, respectively, and have poured money into developing sleek, albeit pricey, new lines.Converse, meanwhile, has labored to keep pace. It has been criticized for being slow to introduce a line of &quot;Magic&quot; shoes and sportswear; it didn't get around to that until last year, long afterNikeand others had flooded the market with their own &quot;signature&quot; products.Moreover, Converse's ads built around its association with Johnson are dimly remembered at best, even within the industry. The company has had more luck with another Johnson, Charlotte Hornets rookie Larry Johnson, who has starred in a well-received series of commercials dressed like his grandmother (the ads' conceit is that even a senior citizen can beat an NBA player in Converse shoes).&quot;One thing that has drivenNikeis their creativity and their ability to use the strengths of their [endorsers] in their ads,&quot; said Bill Strickland, president of the basketball division of International Management Group, the nation's largest sports agents' firm. &quot;You don't see any of that from Converse. ... For the association with Converse not to be stronger would suggest that [Johnson's criticism] is on point.&quot;Yet another shoe could drop soon for Converse. Sources said yesterday that tennis star and Converse endorser Jimmy Connors will end his association with the company shortly. (Converse has issued a statement repudiating press reports that Johnson's fellow basketball star, Larry Bird, was considering bolting from the company's employ too.)In Monaco yesterday, Johnson indicated that his unhappiness with Converse began when he first signed with the company. Then, Converse boasted an all-star lineup of endorsers -- Johnson, Bird, Julius &quot;Dr. J&quot; Erving, Kevin McHale of Boston and Isiah Thomas of Detroit. &quot;I kept telling them they weren't taking advantage of that situation,&quot; Johnson told the AP.&quot;At that time, everybody was calling Converse shoes 'Docs' on the playground because of Doctor J. [Erving's nickname]. I said they should just call the shoes 'Docs.' But they told me a player will never sell shoes. Then Michael Jordan came along and he proved them wrong, but they're still saying it.&quot;Johnson added that Converse &quot;got tired of me complaining and I got tired of them not listening.&quot;Converse President Gilbert &quot;Gib&quot; Ford called Johnson's comments &quot;surprising,&quot; especially since Johnson is under contract with Converse for two more years. That could limit Johnson's ability to seek another shoe endorsement deal.The company issued a statement saying that it has spent more than $ 35 million on advertising and marketing programs featuring Johnson, including a special public-service campaign called &quot;Magic's Athletes Against AIDS&quot; last fall after Johnson announced that he has the virus that leads to AIDS. It said it would launch a second AIDS campaign with Johnson later this summer, and it is currently airing an ad with an Olympics theme featuring him, Bird and Larry Johnson.Converse, however, may not have had the financial muscle to play with the big boys recently. Its parent company, Interco Inc., a conglomerate that also owns the London Fog raincoat brand, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since the beginning of last year.Although Converse's ad budget isn't known, observers said the company has cut back on media advertising to conserve cash, concentrating instead on &quot;grass roots&quot; marketing, building its brand by supplying shoes to amateur and pro teams.",0.0910857849633,0.379725093501,944 words,A Sneaker Maker Loses Its Magic;Star's Parting Shot as Converse Endorser Underscores Firm's Troubles in Ad Race,1992-07-23 00:00:00,988 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Washington Post
"LORNE RUBENSTEINOakville, Ont.THE lush green fairways of the Glen Abbey Golf Club will be full of someof the top players in the world when the Canadian Open begins tomorrow.But last evening at a player&quot;Tour meeting a series of issues concerningthe Tour were paramount, and they will continue to be so until they areresolved.The meeting apparently concerned a number of related issues. Onecentral item concerns the number of players exempt for the followingseason. Currently the top 125 money-winners are exempt. Other criteriaalso admit more players, but that number is the most significant.&nbsp;Some players, Tom Watson for one, have long felt that too many playersget in by virtue of finishing in the top 125. The argument is that aplayer can go along making $30,000 or $40,000 for the season and thenbreak through with a late-season second or third place. Bingo, he'sexempt.Limiting exemptions to perhaps 110 or 115 makes many playersuncomfortable. Jeff Sluman is one of four player directors on the 10-mantournament policy board, and said yesterday that it's not easy to thinkabout reducing opportunities. That would be one inevitable result ofchanges to the all-exempt list.But the question of the number of exempt players does not exist inisolation. PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman pointed out at the Abbey thatit's related to the persistent problem of slow play, and also to thequestion of stocking what was the Ben Hogan Tour and is now theNikeTour.TheNikeTour is a secondary series of 30 tournaments that the PGA Tourwill run next season, as it has the Hogan Tour. It's a breeding ground forfuture PGA Tour players. Tom Lehman is one such player. He led the HoganTour in winnings last year and has won $424,378 on the PGA Tour this yearfor 25th place.The PGA Tour wants more players on theNikeTour. That can be seeneither as a benevolent notion that would give players some experiencebefore they reach the PGA Tour. A cynic might argue that moving thegolfers who finish from 110th to 125th from the PGA Tour to theNikeTouris a lazy and harsh way of ridding the big circuit of unwanted players.There's also the vexing problem of slow play. Some players said itwould be the main issue on last night's agenda. Any reduction in exemptplayers would feed into the number of contestants in PGA Tour events.There's talk that the number should go from 156 players in summer's fullfields to 132.Beman said that slow play is indeed a serious concern. He mentionedthat there are too many players on the course before the field is cutafter 36 holes.Have fewer exempt players, then. Drop some sponsor exemptions. Eraselocal qualifying each Monday that admits four players. So go some of theideas.Paul Azinger, like other golfers, believes Tour officials should simplyget tougher on slow play. A player is currently warned that he is beingtimed. If he is timed twice as playing slowly then he is fined $500. Fourbad times gets him a $1,500 penalty, with two shots added to his score.But PGA Tour officials are reluctant to impose slow play penalties.&quot;I'll tell you what,&quot; Azinger said. &quot;Our officials would have troublegiving me two shots, or fining me for slow play. They know me, and all ofthem but one like me. It's harder to fine a player you know and like. Itmay not be so hard for an official to fine a player he doesn't like.&quot;Azinger mentioned Scott Hoch as one player who might fall into thelatter category. His point was that personal attachments get in the way ofassessing penalties.Player director Peter Jacobsen had something of the same idea. Hecalled slow play a &quot;joke,&quot; said &quot;there are too many bodies out here,&quot; andsuggested that rules officals are too important to be speed cops.&quot;The best way to deal with slow play is with peer pressure,&quot; Jacobsensaid.Who knows? Maybe he will name the slow players in a book he has writtenfor spring publication. It's called Buried Lies: Tall Tales and TrueStories from the PGA Tour. Azinger mentioned that one of Jacobsen's ideasis to fine a slow player 10 per cent of his earnings at an event.PGA Championship winner and defending Canadian Open champion Nick Priceargued slightly differently.&quot;We know who the slow players are out here,&quot; Price said. &quot;We should bedealing with them.&quot;Players wouldn't say for publication who the slow players are. But manycould take lessons from fast players Price, Daly, Watson and LannyWadkins.It all amounts to plenty of important issues on the PGA Tour. Careerscould be at stake. It remains to be seen what will emerge from lastnight's meeting. One thing was certain as night settled on Glen Abbey: Themeeting was going to be well-attended, and sparks would fly.",0.058676046176,0.427092352092,776 words,CANADIAN OPEN   Sparks flying off the greens,1992-09-09 00:00:00,992 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Globe and Mail (Canada)
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) - Bo Jackson's hip injury put his professional baseball and football careers on hold, but hasn't cost him a step in his other high-paying job - commercial pitchman.Ad makers for Pepsi-Cola Co. andNikeInc. have even turned Bo's injury to their advantage, pressing him into service in new advertising.&quot;What else have I got to do this summer?,&quot; Jackson says as he sits in a beach chair in a cameo appearance in Pepsi's summer ad campaign.&nbsp;He does everything but relax in the latest and probably the last edition of his &quot;Bo Knows . . .&quot; commercials forNike.In a commercial filmed at the Culver City Studios, Jackson abruptly walks out on his own Las Vegas-style show to start some serious rehabilitation in the gym. That leaves the door open for that burger-eating boxer George Foreman and others who jump at the chance to fill Bo's shoes in the lounge act.The newNikeads begin running July 9 during the All-Star baseball game telecast, the same occasionNikeused two years ago to launch the series with a commercial that also featured another famous Bo, bluesman Bo Diddley.That commercial and a 1990 ad that showed Jackson ready to compete in a dozen different sports made him one of the best-known athlete endorsers in the business and added a phrase to the American vernacular.As the rare athlete who successfully competes in two professional sports, Jackson was a natural fit forNike'scross-training shoe, designed for multiple uses - running, shooting baskets, lifting weights, riding a bike.Helped by Jackson's commercials,Nikesays sales of the shoes have climbed from nothing in 1987 to about $400 million (U.S.) this year, making them second only to basketball shoes among top-rankedNike'sbest-selling models.Consumer surveys by the research firm Video Storyboard Tests Inc. indicated Jackson was the best-known endorser from sports in 1989 and ranked him second only to football's Joe Montana in 1990. The 1991 results aren't in yet.Sports Marketing Letter rated Jackson as the 10th most sought-after sports figure by marketers this year despite the hip injury. The newsletter's publisher, Brian Murphy, estimated Jackson will make $5 million this year from advertising, several million more than he will likely make from sports.The injury Jackson suffered while playing football for the Los Angeles Raiders has prevented him from playing baseball this year. The Kansas City Royals dropped him after doctors said he might never play again, but he was signed by the Chicago White Sox.His doctors say Jackson is making progress and will be re-evaluated over the All-Star break to see if he can play baseball this season.But his injury raised questions about Jackson's commercial career. Some marketing experts said Jackson would likely fade from view as many retired athletes have if he were unable to play again. Others said his struggle back would keep people interested.Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, said Jackson remains in demand.Besides the extra work for Pepsi andNike,Woods said, Jackson is promoting lines of sports medicine and fitness products and is considering two major endorsement offers that wouldn't have been made without the injury. Woods declined to identify them.Even before Jackson was injured,Nike'sad makers had been seeking a way to give the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; series of ads a bigsendoff.&quot;The whole 'Bo Knows' thing had been overexposed,&quot; said Jim Riswold, the Wieden &amp; Kennedy ad writer who created the series three years ago. &quot;The time to end 'Bo knows' has come.&quot;Scott Bedbury,Nike'sadvertising director, agreed that he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; to see any more variations on the theme next year althoughNikewill probably use Jackson in other commercials.Riswold came up with a stylish sendoff.Jackson is the star of the &quot;Bo Show,&quot; a garish act with 20 chorus girls in White Sox or Raiders jerseys, a 30- piece orchestra and Bo's name in lights.&quot;Bo knows it's got that air thing,&quot; the chorus girls sing as they dance around Jackson, who is wearing a tuxedo and has a microphone in hand.But after a few choruses, Jackson has second thoughts. He yells for the band to stop. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he says, walking off the stage.The camera then moves to a living room where the TV set is tuned to the Bo show. Mom is shocked and Dad looks perplexed as Bo crawls through the set.&quot;I've got rehab to do,&quot; Jackson mutters as he reaches back into the set for his cross-trainers.&quot;Nice shoes,&quot; a boy sitting on the floor says as Jackson passes through the living room.&quot;You watch too much TV, kid,&quot; Jackson shoots back.In the gym, Jackson lifts weights, pedals a stationary bike and works out in the pool. He can't shake that irritating &quot;air thing&quot; song, though.&quot;You know I don't have time for this,&quot; he yells at theNikelogo.After Jackson walks away, the logo rolls up, revealing the same glitzy set where the backlights have been changed to read, &quot;Not Bo.&quot;&quot;But I do,&quot; says Foreman, dressed in a tux and surrounded by the chorus girls now dressed in boxer shorts and orange boxing gloves.&quot;Hit it,&quot; Foreman orders, as the band plays again and the girls sing &quot;George knows . . .&quot;Nikehas three other endings for use later in the year.In one version, Los Angeles Kings star Wayne Gretzky takes over from Bo, a throwback to the original &quot;Bo knows . . .&quot; ad where Gretzky was the only athlete unable to attest that Jackson could play his sport - ice hockey.The other versions end with pairs of athletes - Darryl Strawberry of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and Jerry Rice of football's San Francisco 49ers in one; Eric Davis of baseball's Cincinnati Reds and Randall Cunningham of football's Philadelphia Eagles in the other.The &quot;Bo knows . . . &quot; campaign may provide the grist for trivia games a few years from now. Jackson may turn up in nostalgic beer or credit card ads.Or the ads may have sent Jackson on the road to a long career as a celebrity spokesperson.&quot;He represents not only a versatile athlete but the whole fad of being fit,&quot; said David Vadehra, head of Video Storyboard Tests, the firm that quizzes thousands of people each year on what commercials they liked best.Sports Marketing Letter's Murphy envisions Jackson effectively pitching recreational sports such as golf, weight training or tennis.&quot;The idea has already been established in the public's mind that this is a guy who does everything,&quot; he said.",0.0488585176085,0.433845208845,1087 words,Ailing Bo Jackson still working in TV ads,1991-06-30 00:00:00,994 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Toronto Star
"Michael Jordan stuck his tongue out at the NBA and its Players Association last week. Stuck it in their faces big time. No longer, he informed them, could they place his tongue or his ears or his nose - in essence, his likeness - on league-licensed apparel.Michael chose to withdraw from the league-union group licensing agreement because the players' share of the approximately $ 45 million-$ 50 million annual revenue is a mere $ 500,000, all of which is placed in a pension fund. He broke ranks - as was his right - and gave exclusive rights to his mug toNike.&nbsp;The reaction has been swift, though not certain. This is rarefied Air, yet to be fully navigated or comprehended. Jordan thus is perceived as greedy by some, while others accuse the league of being exploitative and the union ill-advised.There is some truth in all of this. But in all of this is a much larger issue. Namely, what becomes of the once-powerful union that forged a unique revenue-sharing alliance with management to resurrect an economically crippled league and ensure prosperity for all?  How quickly all is threatened.How quickly all is forgotten.While Jordan was enrolling in North Carolina andNikewas in its infancy during the early 1980s, the league's owners and players sacrificed, they shared, and together they savored. Failing franchises were revived. Insolvent owners were displaced. Television contracts and marketing revenues soared. (Players share 53 percent of the gross.) And the league once perceived as that of drug users and deviates became a glitzy rock-and-roll road show featuring Doc, Magic, Larry.No one wants the show to end. Yet many foresee Jordan's defection as potentially disastrous, with other premierNikeendorsers sure to follow, and other, similar developments equally sure to threaten the collective fiber of the union-league relationship.Strange alliances once again are quickly forming. NBA commissioner David Stern - ever cognizant that his league has never had a strike - is monitoring the situation closely, perhaps to intervene at some point. The union's executive director, Charles Grantham, who inherited the current agreement from Larry Fleisher, is anxious, concerned. Union president Isiah Thomas is both disheartened and fearful.Though quick to concede the group licensing agreement is inadequate in today's market, Thomas believes the matter will be resolved during the next collective bargaining session in 1993-94. Or, if Jordan was so dissatisfied, why didn't he form his own apparel company - as did Magic - and become one of the NBA's authorized licensees?&quot;None of us can say that what Michael is doing is wrong,&quot; said Thomas, &quot;but would I do it? No. I've always tried to do what's best for the league, without forgetting that it was a group approach that made us strong.&quot;Several of Thomas's friends say he is so disheartened by recent developments that he considered resigning, then reconsidered. The timing, he felt, was not right.The timing, in fact, could hardly be worse.The league is still reeling from the news that Magic has the HIV virus. Bird is fast nearing retirement, and even Jordan and Charles Barkley are closing in on the end. Their successors - those stars or characters with charisma - are yet to be named. Yet to be sighted.Economically, the next big television contract appears to be a thing of the past, with networks feeling the pinch. The union and league already are embroiled in a legal debate over defined gross revenue. Other skirmishes await. And just outside the arenas, the homeless, the unemployed, the many without quality health care illustrate how Americans are continuing to suffer from the me-first mistakes and fiscal foibles of decades past.Is there perhaps a lesson to be learned here? Just a few.Jordan is a good guy, a bright guy. Magic likes him immensely and is quick to acknowledge that he has every right to capitalize in a capitalistic society. &quot;But I do want to talk to him about this,&quot; said Magic. &quot;I want to hear his motives. Is he mad at the union? Something else? I want to find out.&quot;But not lost on Magic is the irony of the 1992 NBA Finals.Jordan agreed to share the wealth.And look who won.",0.150274725275,0.532768620269,704 words,Defections like Jordan's could sap NBA's financial strength,1992-02-03 00:00:00,996 of 998 DOCUMENTS,The Atlanta Journal and Constitution
