"There's the rhythmic thump of a basketball on a gym floor and the whack . . . whack . . . whack of a tennis match. Tropical fish glide behind a clear wall while, elsewhere, a tennis racket personally ruined by John McEnroe is displayed.Then, of course, the shoes. Running shoes. Tennis shoes. Basketball shoes. Golf shoes. Hiking shoes. Wrestling shoes. Soccer shoes. Shoes that bristle with static energy, shoes that gleam under spotlights, flanked by racks of lycra clothing in neon and black.Sounds, sights - and products.Just Do It.&nbsp;This isNikeTown, America's new kid on the retailing block that blends '70s Disco decor, straight-up '80s consumerism with '90s marketing savvy into a virtual reality shopping experience aimed at people with bucks who like to hum when they cruise the aisles.Sounds, images, colors and computers converge here in a store devoted exclusively to sports and an atmosphere that puts the shopper in the starting block, on the 14th tee or slam-dunking with the scoreboard showing 112-111.Or reaching for their wallets and purses.Just Do It.&quot;A lot of people do like to shop and when they shop, atmosphere is important,&quot; says store manager Mary Burns, a mid-Westerner with a strong merchandising resume.Nearby, Tom and Donna Sunderland, up from Stockton, Calif., flip through the racks, their tanned faces glowing at the goods.&quot;This store,&quot; says Tom, &quot;is just the greatest.&quot;Adds Donna: &quot;I felt like jogging after being in here for only a few seconds. It really pumps you up.&quot;NikeTown, opened last November byNikeInc., is retail theatre, one of those things only the U.S. of A. would do, or want to do - meaning it's risky and expensive.But doubts that the entire exercise is just a doomed, dippy marketing balloon dissolve, somewhat, when Burns pulls out some figures.On a recent Saturday in August, 5,000 people went through the store. It has a capacity for 350 shoppers.She calculatesNikeTown draws at least 30,000 customers a week, or about 150,000 people a month.It opened Nov. 21, so let's say 1.5 million people to date have trooped through Town.That's 1.5 million through a store that is only 4,570 square metres (15,000 square feet).Lineups to get in here are not uncommon and the store has become a major tourist attraction for the city.&quot;It's finally put Portland on the map,&quot; declares Sandy Macomber, librarian at the Oregonian newspaper a few blocks away.Yesssssss!*NikeInc. was founded by Phil Knight (a middle distance runner) and Bill Bowerman (his coach). It is the biggest sports and fitness company in the U.S. with net profits in 1989 reaching $ 167 million. They've sold five million pairs of Air Pegasus, aNikerunning shoe, alone.NikeInc.'s world headquarters were established in the nearby Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1979.Nike(rhymes with Mikey) is the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh curve in the trademark was designed by a Portland State University student.Jimmie Connors won the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open wearingNikes. In 1983, Jean Benoit shattered the women's world marathon time wearingNikes. Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan made them a cult shoe.Nike, it follows, treats sports and shoes very, very seriously.&quot;A couple of years agoNikedecided that it wanted to build a store that would represent their collections or their sports categories the way they designed and developed them,&quot; says Burns.From the concept emerged the town - resist the temptation to call it Smelly Runnerville - a two-storey, 4,570-square-metre store in downtown Portland. For Lower Mainlanders, it is about a seven-hour drive south down the I-5.The idea ofNikeTown was to merchandise footwear, apparel and accessories - 95 per cent of what is in theNikecatalogue is on display in the store - not just to consumers, but to retailers as well.NikeTown, Burns said, was supposed to be fun and so unique in retail, &quot;that it was more than just a store.&quot;More than just a store.Let's say you want to buy a wet suit for sailboarding. AtNikeTown you stroll to the Aqua Gear pavilion, the name for each area selling a different sports product.Here, you see the tropical fish. At your feet, a multi-screen image - on the floor! you can walk on it! - depicts scenes of rippling water. The background music is the sound of rushing water, virtually real. You can hear the water, if not the cash register.&quot;The uniqueness of the atmos-phere of each sports category is felt when you walk in,&quot; says Burns.The products sit on a surfboard shelf. The salesperson will be a sailboarder, dressed in sports gear, who will push a few IBM computer buttons to check the inventory and order your purchase, which is delivered smoothly via large acrylic tubes from the basement.There is no disappearing act by the salesman to find the goods. They remain with the customer, discussing the product, signing them up for the next sailboarding competition or just chatting about the latest sports scores. It's called schmoozing.*Gordon Thompson was hired byNikeInc. as creative director ofNikeTown. For inspiration, he visited the stage set of the movie Back to the Future, which based a lot of its action around a town square. He'd also visited many older European towns. Ditto, town squares.Thus,NikeTown includes maybe a dozen pavilions linked by a common area, an elevator and a catwalk. A two-storey town was born. The entrance and passageway lighting was kept Nightclub Dark, with each pavilion becoming an oasis of bright lights, a palette of color and products - moving the shopper from dark to light. Get it?In addition to the merchandise, the layout and the sound track, a museum element was introduced to entice shoppers.They can gaze at a basketball signed by Michael Jordan or Nolan &quot;Tex&quot; Ryan's shoes and hat. Sports heros like Bo Jackson or the Portland Blazers visit the store to autograph equipment or offer advice, all adding to the sports aura, all bringing shoppers through the door.DevelopingNikeTown as an &quot;event&quot; rather than a retail centre carried the risk that people will look, rather than buy. It was a risk thatNike, competing with the likes of Adidas, Reeboks, LA Gear and Brooks, could accept.Says Burns: &quot;We didn't know on day one when we opened if there would be a line of people at the door. We didn't know if people would find it interesting. But the first two weeks we had lines a block long to get in the store. We couldn't get everybody in.&quot;Right now I would say that every Sunday morning now, there are at least 70 people outside the front door, waiting to get in. It's amazing. We are a tourist attraction, people bring their cameras to take pictures.&quot;Nikewon't release any sales or dollar figures, but Burns says, &quot;we are definitely meeting our expectations in that area.&quot;One indication thatNikeTown is approaching black ink came when the company announced it will open anotherNikeTown in Chicago, a 50,000-square-foot store, next May and plans additionalNikeTowns for New York and Europe.Less enthusiastic about such retail theatre is Toronto retailing analyst John Winter.&quot;You have to realize that the sports shoe market has become very competitive. IfNikecan get an edge by selling through an attractive outlet. That's fine. If you can get an edge, it's fine for a year or two. Concept retailers have a very short shelf life.&quot;There's a lot of distractions, from salesgirls wearing shorts to music and atmosphere and all that. They all detract from the fact that it's $ 150 US you're paying for shoes made in the Phillipines by someone paid 75 cents an hour.&quot;But it's merchandising. Brilliant merchandising.&quot;*NikeTown is also aimed at retailers who visit the store to draw ideas from the racking, the presentation and the concept they can then apply to their own stores.Nikedoesn't advertiseNikeTown, relying on word-of-mouth and media stories to do the rest after it trumpeted the official opening.&quot;The main reason is other retailers sellNikeproducts too and our intention is not to compete with them but to help and enhance the business totally. If Footlocker or Nordstrom wants to run the same product we have at 20 (per cent) off, that's good, that's okay, that's their business. We're here just to enhance whatNikeis all about,&quot; says Burns.&quot;Is this the wave of the future? Well, it's a combination of design and merchandising, but also service. We've heard that over and over again. We went from a very service-oriented retail environment many years ago to self- service to 'wait a minute, people still really want service' especially with price points and technical products, they deserve to know why this costs what it costs and in order to do that, you have to service the customer.&quot;Make no mistake,NikeTown is aimed squarely at middle and upper-income campers who don't flinch at a $ 360 US price tag for a Goretex running suit or at $ 225 US Air Super Dome AC6 hiking boots or $ 150 US Air Force 180 basketball runners.Nikecontinues to operate a factory outlet seven kilometres away fromNikeTown, where prices are 20 to 30 per cent lower.NikeTown, says Burns, is for the customer, &quot;who wants the atmosphere, wants the design and wants to be able to say, 'I bought it atNikeTown.' &quot;Heather Shannon, director of retailing for Ernst Young in Vancouver, observes thatNikeTown typifies the polarization of retail stores in North America into either discount, bare bones-type stores or high end, service-oriented, experience-oriented outlets.&quot;It fits in well with that as an over-all trend,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;And as far as demographics are concerned, people are demanding more from retailers and expecting more. As we age we get crankier and more demanding.&quot;*If you buy it atNikeTown, you may buy it from Ethan Egan, a twentysomething salesman and former Nordstrom salesman who jumped at the chance to work atNike.&quot;I went toNikeclasses in product knowledge before the store opened so we were all primed for opening day,&quot; says Egan, who pointed out the store's features during a stroll through each pavilion.He jogs and plays soccer, skills that he uses daily in talking to customers. &quot;I love it here,&quot; he says.",0.159520622312,0.437183345242,1722 words,NikeTown is retail theatre U.S.A.: A running start:NIKE:store aimed at middle and upper-income campers,"September 21, 1991, Saturday, 1* EDITION",1 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"When he last took inventory, Keith Goodie, a University of the District of Columbia basketball player, owned 56 pairs of top-of-the-line sneakers, made byNike, Adidas, New Balance, Reebok and Gucci, in colors that included red, white, black, gray, green, blue, brown and gold.&quot;That's just me,&quot; Goodie said of the $ 4,000 he spent on sneakers last year. &quot;People tell me, 'Keith, man, you've got a pair of tennis shoes to match every jacket you wear.' I take it as a compliment. It's just me.&quot;It's more than just Goodie.Once associated with games of youth, sneakers have become a cultural phenomenon, promoted by millionaire athletes and bought by fashion-conscious Americans who last year spent $ 11.7 billion on 393 million pairs of brand-name athletic shoes. The phenomenon is especially remarkable in that black inner city youths such as Goodie set the pace and styles for an industry managed mostly by white businessmen who sell the bulk of these products to white consumers.&nbsp;&quot;I don't know anybody who doesn't have at least 20 pairs, just for dressing,&quot; said Goodie, 25. &quot;My 5-year-old son grows out of them so fast, I have to buy him four pair a month.&quot;The sneaker craze was spawned by the fitness boom of the 1980s -- andNiketook the lead through the signing of basketball star Michael Jordan as an endorser in 1984, the introduction of the Air Jordan shoe in 1985 and the airing of TV ads starring black celebrities such as Jordan and actor/filmmaker Spike Lee.Nikerevenues soared from $ 270 million in fiscal 1980 to an industry-leading $ 2.23 billion last year. But this classic American success story is about more than money: It is about marketing strategies and social responsibility, about what some see as sound business practice and others see as exploitation.Helena Jones, principal of all-black Roper Junior High in Northeast Washington, says sneaker companies target their advertising toward black children. John Thompson, basketball coach at Georgetown University and aNikeconsultant, says the companies' marketing strategies are questioned because so many of the endorsers are black.Jones says demand for high-priced, high-tech sneakers drove some of her former students to sell drugs. Thompson says singling out sneakers is unfair because other luxury items are as coveted but do not face similar scrutiny.&quot;In the black community, name-brands are a status thing,&quot; said Goodie's coach, George Leftwich, a black Washingtonian and former salesman for the Converse sneaker company. &quot;Yes, these are false goals. I don't know if low self-esteem is too strong, but for some reason people need to have visible importance.&quot;The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in an interview in his downtown Washington office, said black endorsers such as Lee, the Chicago Bulls' Jordan and San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson are fueling the desires of children who can ill afford the $ 125 Air Jordan or (coming soon) the $ 160 Reebok Pump II.&quot;They are exploiting an ethos of mindless materialism,&quot; Jackson said of the endorsers. &quot;Our youth are trapped with economic depression, with zero-based self-esteem: 'I am nothing. You are less. If you cross me, I will shoot you. For my inadequate feelings about myself I must at least identify with the best. So I cover up my inadequate feelings with $ 200 tennis shoes.' &quot;Nikeexecutives and endorsers reject Jackson's criticism.&quot;We're promoting people who are real positive role models,&quot; saidNikeVice President/Marketing Tom Clarke. &quot;I mean, if we had [heavy-metal rock star] Axl Rose [as an endorser], would that be as good? Or is it better to have athletes who have to work hard to do well?&quot;&quot;The issue is our value system, not the fact that Spike Lee or Michael Jordan advertiseNikeshoes,&quot; said Thompson, who receives more than $ 200,000 a year as aNikeconsultant. &quot;Because people will also kill you for your jewelry. Should we blame the jewelry companies too? Ninety-nine percent of the motorcycle gangs are wearing crosses. Does that mean that churches should shut down?&quot; Who Buys What?Nikeofficials say 87 percent of all their products -- including shoes, clothing and accessories -- are sold to whites. No racial statistics are kept onNikebasketball shoe sales because, Clarke said, &quot;We just target one group: People who love to play basketball and anybody else who is excited or finds a lot of emotional bonding with that activity.&quot; Clarke said 60 percent ofNike'sbasketball shoes are bought by people who do not play the sport, even recreationally.Visits to Washington-area shopping malls confirm that youngsters of all races are in the hunt for stylish basketball shoes. But buying patterns differ between blacks and whites, according to consumers and retail store employees interviewed in recent weeks.&quot;When the inner-city kids spend money, they'll buy the $ 130Nike[Air Command Force] hightops, the $ 44 Champion sweatshirt and the $ 110 Starter hooded parka all at the same time . . . so you've got all the colors hooking up,&quot; said Vinny Vincenzes, head footwear buyer for Irving's Sport Shops Inc., which owns 19 stores in the Washington area.&quot;But in the [white suburbs] instead of the kids coming in, the parent will buy the shoes. Then maybe a month later the parent will get his kid the hooded parka. Then maybe for Christmas he'll buy the Champion sweatshirt. The [white] suburban kids don't buy product as fast.&quot;Buying patterns varied among youngsters interviewed on a recent afternoon at Champs sports shop at the Pentagon City Mall.Jeremy Peine, a white 14-year-old, owns three pairs of sneakers, including Air Jordans. &quot;My parents give me half the money for myNikes, and I pay the other half,&quot; he said. &quot;I save money from doing chores around the house, selling old things at yard sales and saving the holiday money I receive from relatives.&quot;Milton Chan, a black 14-year-old, said his wardrobe includes 20 pairs of sneakers. &quot;I need them -- I really do -- because my shoes wear out so fast,&quot; he said. &quot;My money comes from a job at a seafood store. I make about $ 10,000 a year and probably spend $ 2,000 a year on [athletic] shoes.&quot;Carey Porter, Jr., a black 20-year-old, said he refuses to become a part of the sneaker craze. &quot;I have four pair and that's too many,&quot; he said. &quot;Black people spend too much money buying shoes. We need to get more into values.&quot;Nikeoffers 22 men's and women's basketball shoe models, most in black and white with accent colors such as &quot;hot lava,&quot; &quot;pink flash&quot; and &quot;clockwork orange.&quot; The company also sends a &quot;special makeup&quot; model -- the Air Force One, which was introduced in 1983 and sells for about $ 80 -- to selected inner city stores. &quot;This shoe is strictly inner city,&quot; one Washington retailer said. &quot;It's not inNike'scatalogue, but it sells well among blacks.&quot;Nikeexecutives say they do not design sneakers with any ethnic group in mind. But Roy Yun, director of product development for Next Sports Inc., a new sneaker company affiliated with New York Knicks star Patrick Ewing, said he consults with young blacks and Hispanics in Brooklyn, upper Manhattan and the Bronx before designing a shoe.&quot;They're the ones who are regularly open with their wallets to buy new items,&quot; Yun said.&quot;The 'brothers' set the trends . . . and the white kids slowly follow,&quot; Vincenzes said.&quot;The ethnic market . . . they buy quality,&quot; said John Morgan, basketball marketing director of Reebok International,Nike'smajor competitor. &quot;That's their statement. They want to make a first-class statement with everything.&quot;In sneaker fashion, colors are important. &quot;I buy sneakers so I can match their colors with my clothes,&quot; Goodie said. &quot;Tomorrow, if I wear a red Polo shirt, I might wear my red New Balance shoes. It's all about matching.&quot;It's also about status. &quot;I don't play in these shoes, I walk around in them,&quot; said UDC basketball player Henry Moton, 22, wearing a pair ofNikeDavid Robinson Force shoes. &quot;You know, I just sport them, let people say, 'Whoa! He's got the David Robinson pump on.' &quot;&quot;Kids wanting sneakers is no different than any banker or insurance person wanting to carry a Mont Blanc pen,&quot; said John Slahetka, a manager of Snyders In Step Shoes, Inc., which has three shops in Northeast and Southeast Washington.It's difficult to explain why a particular brand, style or color gets hot. Or why, several years ago, sneaker chic meant wearing one's shoelaces untied.&quot;Anything all-black is a guaranteed winner in the inner city,&quot; said Vincenzes. &quot;The Air Jordan that just came out in black sold out in two days. Purple also does well. But in the suburbs . . . the kids want whatever is being promoted and advertised as being the hottest. Colors aren't as important.&quot;&quot;It's very clear that black, inner city kids have a very different fashion sense from white suburban kids,&quot; said Wally Grigo, owner of three Connecticut stores. &quot;At my store that sells mostly to blacks, we sold 700 pair of Fila hightops during a seven-week period last year. We didn't advertise. It was all word of mouth. And not one of those shoes sold in our 99-percent white store.&quot;&quot;One difference between whites and blacks is that a lot of black kids won't wear dirty sneakers,&quot; said Kevin Lewis, 20, a black salesman at Athletic Shoe Box in Alexandria. &quot;If the shoes get a little dirt on them, kids will buy another pair. When I was in high school, the longest I had a pair was a month and a half. My shoes had to look fresh.&quot; Ethnicity and EconomicsThoughNikeofficials say they do not target sales to any ethnic group, black dialect has been used in someNikeTV ads.In one spot, Mars Blackmon, the nerdy Spike Lee character, presses Air Jordan sneakers to each side of his head and says: &quot; . . . Yo Homes, Yo Homes, Yo Homes. . . . These sneakers be housin', housin' across the country . . . And every homeboy should be bum-rushin' to get some, get some.&quot;NikeChairman Phil Knight, in an interview at his sprawling headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., said the ad &quot;talks to the black athlete and inner city kids and to the white basketball player in the suburbs.&quot;Clarke, theNikevice president, said white teenagers &quot;generally know what's happening&quot; in the ad. The word &quot;housin' &quot; he said, means the sneakers are &quot;moving,&quot; or selling.Jesse Jackson said the ad is aimed directly at young blacks. &quot;First of all, it's clear that blacks do not refer to whites as 'homeboy,' &quot; he said. &quot;It's ethnic. It's targeted. You know, ghetto lingo.&quot;Thompson said he is &quot;suspicious&quot; of people who say sneaker companies are targeting inner city youth. &quot;The minute black folks can capitalize on money, it becomes sinful for them to endorse shoes,&quot; he said.During the interview, Knight was shown a glossy color photo inNike's1989 annual report that featured Jordan -- a tense look on his face -- modeling Air Jordan shoes and apparel in front of a grimy, graffiti-scarred brick wall.Knight examined the photo and said: &quot;We wouldn't run that picture today because of certain sensitivities. But, I mean, basically, basketball has an enormous number of faces. It has an inner city face, a playground face, a country-road face, an Indiana face, the pro face. That was the inner city face.&quot;Knight added that the photo was seen by company executives and shareholders, not by the general public. &quot;The guys who get this annual report are institutions and, you know, white guys with money, really,&quot; he said.Reebok's Morgan said blacks are selected to appear in basketball ads because, &quot;Basketball is dominated by blacks and authenticity is really important. To have a basketball ad with all whites and Chinese doesn't make sense. Kids get turned off because it's not authentic.&quot;Knight said someNikeads featuring black athletes shouldn't be taken too literally. InNike's&quot;Mister Robinson's Neighborhood&quot; TV campaign, for example, David Robinson asks viewers if they know how to say &quot;kick some butt.&quot;&quot;The 'kick some butt,' we knew we were pushing it a little,&quot; Knight said. &quot;But that is the way people talk when they say, 'Okay, let's go get 'em.' It speaks to the youth.&quot; The Drug EquationOne outgrowth of the athletic shoe craze -- and a public relations nightmare for sneaker companies -- is the profits retailers and manufacturers earn, if unintentionally, from sales to gangs and drug dealers.&quot;That's a frustration: to see everything we're doing that's good and positive get derailed for something that is really, to some degree, out of our control,&quot; said Peter Ruppe,Nike'smarketing manager for basketball products.Knight said he refused to fill an order from a large retail company that had requested sneakers in new colors. &quot;Gangs have these color codes,&quot; he explained. &quot;When we understood that [the retailer] wanted colors to coincide with some gangs, we refused to do it.&quot;Law enforcement officials said athletic shoes and apparel took their place in the drug culture in the mid-1980s, early in the sneaker boom.Now, in the Washington area, drug dealers assemble wardrobes with as many as 100 pairs of sneakers, adopt shoe brands as nicknames, use athletic apparel to recruit pre-teenage runners and lookouts, accept stolen sneakers as payment from addicts and substitute the word &quot;sneakers&quot; for &quot;ounces&quot; in coded conversations, according to federal and District law enforcement sources.&quot;I first encountered this during a raid in Los Angeles about six years ago,&quot; a Drug Enforcement Administration agent said. &quot;When we went into this dope dealer's house, he had over 100 pairs of sneakers in his bedroom. He had every color imaginable. At first I thought maybe he was also dealing in shoes on the side.&quot;Vincenzes, the Irving's buyer, recalled seeing suspected drug dealers in a national chain store where Vincenzes worked in 1987: &quot;They'd buy 10 pair of shoes at a time. I'd see 15-year-olds with a wad of bills that would choke a horse.&quot;Last fall, when a federal agent raided the house of a drug suspect in suburban Maryland, he found two closets full of sneakers, many with price tags still attached. &quot;Your mid- to upper-level drug dealers use sneakers as a recruiting tool,&quot; one narcotics officer said. &quot;Sneakers are status.&quot;Sneakers retain their status in jails. &quot;On the streets, drug dealers equate status with the automobiles they drive,&quot; another DEA agent said. &quot;In jail, sneakers have the same structure. Since they're all wearing the same prison clothing, the better your sneakers, the more status you have.&quot;Even in court, some drug defendants make basketball shoes their footwear of choice. Former cocaine kingpin Rayful Edmond III wore sneakers to a sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court here last year. A basketball enthusiast, Edmond once named an adult summer league team that he coached &quot;Reeboks&quot; and outfitted his players in Reebok shoes and T-shirts.At a federal court trial here in 1989, prosecutors introduced into evidence 76 sneakers confiscated during the arrest of Melvin Butler, a Los Angeles Crips gang member and Edmond cocaine broker.&quot;The shoes were such an unusual discovery, it was like Imelda Marcos's closet,&quot; said Cynthia Lobo, Butler's lawyer. &quot;It's the kind of thing that people say, 'Look, they're $ 200, $ 300 shoes. Where'd you get the money?' The government introduced this evidence to suggest to the jury that my client was a young black male who had so many tennis shoes.&quot; Lobo called the tactic &quot;racist.&quot;Ruppe said gangs identify with name-brand sneakers because, &quot;They're extremely popular with youth regardless of whether you want to be in a gang or not. It's part of the culture. It's like: Hey, if I'm on a team, I wear what the rest of the team wears.&quot;Mark Van Grack, who owns the three Snyders stores, said he will not turn away business from known drug dealers. &quot;Who is any retailer, no matter what product they're selling, to be the judge of how somebody made their money?&quot; said Van Grack, who is white. &quot;And then because of how they made their money, restrict them as to the product they can buy? That's prejudice. You can't do that.&quot;One Snyders customer was Edmond, whose gang was linked to as many as 30 murders. Asked about the business he received from Edmond, Van Grack said: &quot;I'd have to say, you know, no comment because whatever I say in that regard is going to be perceived wrong. . . . No, we don't condone what he does. . . . Why ask the question? What's the difference?&quot;Grigo, the Connecticut retailer, focused national attention on this issue in 1989 when he displayed a sign in his front window that read: IF YOU DEAL DRUGS, WE DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.Grigo, who is white, said he put the sign up after suspected drug dealers -- most of them black -- were spending about $ 2,000 a week in his downtown New Haven store. That summer, Grigo said a sales representative from a major sneaker company told him, &quot;You've got to find your market niche. You're an inner city store. You've got to hook up the drug dealers.&quot; Grigo declined to name the company.  The Price of Looking GoodIn Washington, drug dealers can buy sneakers from truck vendors who cruise narcotics strips. &quot;The hustlers like to buy straight out of the trucks because it would cost them money to leave The Strip,&quot; said a Washington Metropolitan Police Dept. narcotics officer. &quot;Sometimes I think they'd rather have a pair of sneakers than a place to live.&quot;At Sasha Bruce Youthwork Inc., a Washington juvenile services organization, counselors speak of how 14-year-old crack dealers routinely wear top-of-the-line sportswear, how one teenager bought $ 80 sneakers with his mother's public-assistance check and how fearful parents buy their children big-ticket athletic apparel to discourage them from dealing drugs.A 15-year-old juvenile offender, enrolled in a Sasha Bruce program, said he began selling crack cocaine as a seventh grader for one reason: &quot; . . . so I could have enough money to buy good-looking clothes and sneakers.&quot;What troubles some inner city parents and educators is that drug dealers have become trendsetters to a larger community.Kevin Lewis, the Alexandria sneaker salesman, recalled the adulation drug sellers received at T.C. Williams High, where he was a student in the late '80s.&quot;They'd come in on a Monday morning with a brand new pair of sneakers,&quot; he said. &quot;The average kid would walk down the hallway saying, 'Man, I like those shoes. But, damn, I can't afford them.' Some kids idolize those types of human beings and they'll do anything to get the kind of clothes they're wearing.&quot;In some large cities, muggings for sneakers and jackets are commonplace; murders for trendy athletic shoes and apparel also have occurred.Knight, theNikechairman, said he became aware of sneaker-related violence in early 1988 when &quot;Spike Lee called and said, 'God dang, some kid just killed another kid for a pair of Air Jordans. That just drives me nuts. Here I am using my creative talents [to advertise Air Jordan] and this happens.' &quot;In April 1990Nikebegan airing &quot;Stay in School&quot; TV spots, starring Lee, Jordan and Thompson. That did not satisfy critics. New York Post sports columnist Phil Mushnick attackedNikefor continuing to air &quot;commercials with no conscience&quot; that urged &quot;tenement-poor kids&quot; to buy &quot;ripoff&quot; sneakers. In May, Sports Illustrated examined sneaker violence in a cover story headlined YOUR SNEAKERS OR YOUR LIFE.Last summerNikereleased a &quot;Mister Robinson's Neighborhood&quot; TV ad in which the 7-foot-1 basketball star tells his viewers: &quot; . . . Garbage is anyone who's into drugs. If you're into drugs, don't get into my shoes. Mister Robinson doesn't like garbage in his shoes. . . . &quot;But the most frequently aired ads send another message: Buy sneakers.Nike, Reebok and L.A. Gear spent $ 4 million for 2 1/2 minutes of advertising during this year's Super Bowl. Attitudes and ValuesThe sneaker business continues to grow, if at a slower pace due to the recession. Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman predicted in a magazine interview last year that by the mid-1990s, &quot;Kids will wear a different pair of sneakers to school every day, depending on their mood.&quot;For Helena Jones, the Roper principal, that's an unsettling thought.Until 1988, when she instituted a voluntary uniform policy at Roper, Jones said her students were obsessed with sneaker fashion.&quot;One kid would buy shoes and tell everybody how much he paid for them,&quot; she said. &quot;Then everybody would talk about how cool they were. And everybody had to have a pair. Then a month later, when that color went out of style, the kids would want another shoe.&quot;The shoe companies definitely gear this keeping-in-style thing to the black kids. Just look at who's buying these sneakers. I know the kind of clothing the white kids wear to school. They don't have a new pair of tennis shoes every month.&quot;Jones said the craze has eased at her school. &quot;Now about 95 percent of our 360 students are wearing uniforms,&quot; she said. &quot;And you don't hear them talk about sneakers anymore.&quot;But Jones has unhappy memories of the days when sneakers were the talk of Roper Junior High.&quot;A lot of good kids were lost to selling drugs during that time,&quot; she said. &quot;And for some, getting the latest clothes and sneakers is what drove them to sell drugs.

"This year,NikeInc. will give Nevada-Las Vegas's Jerry Tarkanian, Georgetown's John Thompson and 54 other college basketball coaches endorsement contracts worth more than $ 4 million, top-of-the-line merchandise valued at $ 600,000 and invitations to a five-day, all-expenses-paid outing in Colorado Springs.As consultants to the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company, the coaches will make promotional appearances, offer suggestions on product improvement and distribute sneakers to their student-athletes. By wearingNikeproducts during televised games, athletes give the company visibility and presumably boost sales.Nikepromotions executive Sonny Vaccaro has been paying &quot;sneaker money&quot; to college coaches for more than a decade. It's a marketing strategy that has made Vaccaro basketball's consummate insider; he says he has joined the Georgetown Hoyas and UNLV Runnin' Rebels for pregame meals.&nbsp;Now L.A. Gear has takenNike'sstrategy a step further, hiring a sports agent, David Spencer, to negotiate contracts with 15 college coaches and youth basketball programs in 36 states. Youth league programs normally distance themselves from sports agents to avoid any suggestion that agents could use such associations to recruit clients.ButNikeofficials were not surprised when Spencer, director of client development for Management Plus Enterprises Inc., appeared on the scene. &quot;They're looking to strike Sonny,&quot; Vaccaro said. In the battle to dominate the $ 11.7 billion athletic footwear market, almost anything goes.College administrators have long been concerned about the influence of shoe companies and the ethics of coaches serving as sneaker consultants. Today, these issues are being examined by the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, the NCAA's Presidents Commission and the National Association of Basketball Coaches.On March 19 the reform-minded Knight Commission -- named after the late newspaper publishers, John and James Knight -- likely will recommend to the NCAA that universities take over negotiations of sneaker contracts from coaches, said Kit Morris, the commission's staff director.If the NCAA implements this proposal, universities will decide on a case-by-case basis how much sneaker money, if any, to give to their coaches. Payments now range from several thousand dollars to more than $ 200,000 a year.&quot;The whole issue raises very serious questions,&quot; Maryland President William E. Kirwan said. &quot;There are questions of conflict of interest. The whole image of a coach getting a large shoe contract. Players having to use a certain kind of shoes. Matters of ethics and appropriate compensation are all involved.&quot;L.A. Gear is the third-largest athletic footwear company, afterNikeand Reebok. Through Spencer, who declined to be interviewed for this story, L.A. Gear made an estimated $ 3 million in endorsement deals last year, ensuring that its products will be worn by more than 10,000 athletes, many of them present and aspiring high school and college stars.&quot;This brings everything to a little different level,&quot; NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz said of the association between Spencer and youth league directors. &quot;It could be highly ethical and there could be absolutely no problems. But it needs to be observed very carefully.&quot;&quot;We're looking at a tremendous potential for conflict of interest and abuse,&quot; said Morris, of the Knight Commission. &quot;At least the potential is there for bartering these athletes from a very early age.&quot;Two youth league directors affiliated with L.A. Gear described Spencer as a highly ethical sports agent who would not solicit clients from among the athletes who participate in their programs.An L.A. Gear spokesman, Howard Bragman, said the sneaker company hired Management Plus because &quot;it has an extraordinary reputation, very good contacts and very good knowledge&quot; of the basketball business. The Los Angeles-based agency's client roster includes Houston Rockets center Akeem Olajuwon, San Francisco 49ers safety Ronnie Lott and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. &quot;Is there any concern about a conflict of interest? Not at all,&quot; Bragman said.Spencer, a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Southern California, came to the agency in 1989. A youth league director who knows Spencer says his mission is clear: to become the next Sonny Vaccaro.Vaccaro, 51, a former high school teacher, sports agent and professional gambler, has heard charges from coaches and sportswriters that he has steered high school basketball stars to college coaches affiliated withNike. Vaccaro said in a recent interview that he has entertained athletes in his home -- even given them sneakers -- but never recommended a school.Vaccaro cringes when he is described as a power broker, as he often is. Then he talks about how in 1987 he had lunch with 6-foot-10 Alonzo Mourning (now at Georgetown) when he was off-limits to college recruiters; how in 1989 he helped arrange an NBA tryout for a then-troubled college athlete, Shawn Kemp; how he decides which coaches get lucrativeNikecontracts and which high schools get freeNikemerchandise.&quot;I have more access than anybody in America,&quot; Vaccaro said in the den of his Pacific Palisades, Calif., townhouse. &quot;I've traveled with John Thompson's teams the last nine years at the NCAA tournaments. I eat dinner with his team the night before. If and when Georgetown gets beat, I go to Georgia Tech and have dinner with their team. Or I go to Arizona. Last year at the Final Four I had dinner with Tark's team. So I do have access, yeah.&quot;All of which makes some college administrators uneasy. &quot;There's a certain sanctity . . . something very special about being on the inside with a team,&quot; said Morris, a former athletics administrator at Harvard, Yale and Davidson (N.C.) College. &quot;It's not the kind of thing someone ought to be able to buy their way on to . . . to have that kind of proximity. You know, what makes Sonny part of that team?&quot; Business AdministrationNike-- named after the Greek goddess of victory -- was founded by a business administration professor, Phil Knight, and his former University of Oregon track coach, Bill Bowerman. From a fledgling company with sales of $ 1.96 million in 1972 -- Bowerman used his wife's waffle iron to develop a sole pattern that has become the industry standard --Nikehas become a $ 2.23 billion multinational giant that spends upward of $ 120 million a year on advertising alone.Knight (no relation to the Knight Commission founders) said his basketball shoe business, which had sales of $ 477 million in fiscal 1990 (runner-up Reebok grossed $ 218 million), grew as a result of innovative product development, imaginative advertising campaigns and promotions that have put the company's signature swoosh on athletes at all levels.A $ 7 million basketball promotions budget -- spent on coaches' contracts, merchandise giveaways and sponsorship of summer leagues and camps -- supports youth programs that might not otherwise exist. And it guarantees high visibility forNikeproducts.&quot;TV has brought teams into everybody's homes, and the teams are being seen in our product,&quot; said Ed Janka, aNikepromotions executive. &quot;Having the excellent coach or camp says that good people wear our product and hopefully the consumer will want to wear our product.&quot;Vaccaro said it's an &quot;ego thing&quot; getting high school all-Americans intoNikes. The summer before his 12th grade year, Mourning said he preferred Converse shoes because, &quot;I wear sneakers that feel good to my feet.&quot; After attending aNike-sponsored summer camp in Princeton, N.J., Mourning switched brands. &quot;Nikesare a little better than any other shoe,&quot; he said at the time.Vaccaro said he received calls from Mourning every 10 days during his recruitment. &quot;We became friends,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;Alonzo asked me 15 times about different schools. I never recommended a school, but I didn't hide that John [Thompson] is a friend. Alonzo knew that. So maybe that helped Georgetown.&quot;Phil Knight, 52, said he is less concerned with Vaccaro's friendships than with reports that youth league officials have used free promotional merchandise to recruit athletes from rival programs.&quot;Of all the criticisms that we've had -- paying college coaches, giving away shoes to high school kids, kids from the inner-city killing for a pair ofNikeshoes -- the one criticism that really was valid was our lack of controls in the summer programs,&quot; Knight said. &quot;We didn't object to giving products to these kids to play in the summer leagues. That's great. But when they [summer league officials] started using them for recruiting purposes, we didn't like that.&quot;At the college level, Knight said he cannot fathom why some administrators object to sneaker contracts. He said the deals result in free merchandise for athletic programs and reduce the university's financial burden to coaches. Some coaches, including Louisiana State's Dale Brown (L.A. Gear) and North Carolina's Dean Smith (Converse), donate portions of their earnings to university-related programs. &quot;Universities factor this into their budgets now,&quot; Knight said.Differences remain, however, on the ethics of a coach accepting as much as $ 200,000, as Thompson and Brown do, for handing out sneakers and making perhaps a dozen appearances a year.&quot;I've long felt that the sneaker company is buying the school [not the coach],&quot; said LSU Athletic Director Joe Dean, a promotions executive for Converse from 1959-86. &quot;I mean, they're buying UCLA, they're buying Georgetown. Because they want the team to wear the shoes to create the exposure. Coaches should get something.  . . . But I have to admit: Even when I was at Converse, I questioned whether a coach deserved to make all that money.&quot;&quot;Shoe contracts are fine as long as they're owned by the university,&quot; the NCAA's Schultz said. &quot;Then if a university wants to pay a coach $ 500,000 or $ 600,000 [in salary and sneaker compensation], that's their business.&quot;Morris said the Knight Commission has compared coaches' sneaker contracts to faculty consulting agreements. Morris's conclusion: there's no comparison.&quot;I don't think there's anything wrong with a coach supplementing his income, but it should relate to talent and skills and working hard,&quot; he said. &quot;In faculty consulting there's brain power and energy going into product development to a far greater extent. With coaches it appears to be more of a reward for high-quality performance by their teams. It's not for splitting an atom or solving a specific problem.&quot;As might be expected, coaches have little patience for critics such as Morris. &quot;How do they know we're not lending brainpower?&quot; said Maryland's Gary Williams, whoseNikedeal is part of his university contract. &quot;We're pretty good experts on basketball shoes. I've been around basketball shoes for 35 years probably. . . . I definitely talk to shoe companies about the style of shoes.&quot;&quot;So all of a sudden it's sinful in this society for a person to be capitalistic?&quot; said Thompson,Nike'shighest-paid coach-endorser. &quot;But as long as I live in America, that's exactly what I'm going to be.&quot;And Morris has little patience for such justifications. &quot;If that's what you're interested in, you might want to find work in the for-profit sector,&quot; he said. &quot;The last time I looked, colleges and universities were not-for-profit.&quot; The Big SweepSonny Vaccaro may be the sultan of sneakers, but he didn't invent the sneaker promotions business.For decades, Chuck Taylor, a World War I-era basketball player, barnstormed the country selling Converse's canvas Chuck Taylor All-Stars. &quot;Chucks,&quot; as they were known, were the basketball shoe of choice through the 1960s, when they sold for about $ 10.&quot;Back then, we'd give a free pair of shoes to a [college] coach or his wife or child,&quot; said Dean, who succeeded Taylor as Converse promotions boss. &quot;We'd do a lot of entertaining [of coaches]. We'd sponsor camps and seminars. But we didn't pay coaches and the teams had to buy their own shoes.&quot;In the late '60s, Adidas, the German manufacturer, began giving away sneakers to selected teams. Converse reluctantly followed, and by the mid-'70s Puma and Pro-Keds were paying college coaches, some as little as $ 500.The ecomonics changed in 1978 when Vaccaro -- already known to coaches as the founder and director of the Dapper Dan high school all-star game in Pittsburgh -- approachedNikewith a scheme.&quot;I told Phil Knight I could probably get him all the major college teams in the country,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;My theory was: There's nothing illegal about this. Just hire the coaches as consultants. Don't ever say that their teams had to wear the shoe. But, you know, these kids wear whatever the coaches tell them to wear. So pay the coach and give shoes to his team so his administration can't be mad.&quot;Vaccaro quickly signed 20 coaches to contracts that averaged $ 2,500. Suddenly, a company known mostly for its running shoes was being trumpeted by Tarkanian and Lefty Driesell. &quot;My kamikaze sweep,&quot; Vaccaro called his first round of signings.Joe Dean said he resisted paying sneaker money until he was approached by Dean Smith and then-Kansas coach Ted Owens -- loyal but unpaid Converse endorsers -- at an NCAA Final Four.&quot;They'd been contacted by other companies,&quot; he said. &quot;So they asked what Converse was going to do. Their attitude was . . . if we did begin to pay, we needed to pay people like them. So we did. We began to compete.&quot;Thompson -- another unpaid Converse endorser -- never received free shoes for his team or a contract offer from Dean. So when Vaccaro came calling in 1979, Thompson was only too happy to put theNikeswoosh on his Hoyas.&quot;Nikejust walked in and made him such a tremendous offer that he switched overnight,&quot; Dean said. &quot;It was a great plum for them.&quot;The offer -- $ 5,000 -- wasn't exactly &quot;tremendous.&quot; But as competition among major sneaker companies increased, so did payments to coaches. In 1982,Nikegave company stock to a dozen high-visibility coaches, including Thompson. &quot;They got very wealthy by the stock,&quot; Vaccaro said. Just how wealthy, Vaccaro would not say, butNikestock has risen 1,000 percent from its price of just under $ 5 a share in late 1982.Today 10Nikecoaches earn more than $ 100,000, Vaccaro said. Top programs also receive 135 pair of sneakers, 25 warm-up suits and 25 travel bags. And there's the annual outing for coaches and their spouses -- a $ 400,000 event, according to Vaccaro -- held in locales such as Hawaii, Bermuda and, this year, Colorado Springs.&quot;John Thompson is the only guy who's never attended,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;John finds it hard to socialize with people who want to beat him.&quot;&quot;WhenNikehas their little picnic . . . they go to some very lavish, wonderful places,&quot; Thompson has said. &quot;Sonny loves that, and I've told him, 'That's the most idiotic thing: You get all those people [together] and they tell one another their business and out of that comes more damn gossip.' &quot;Still, Vaccaro considers Thompson his most valuable coach: &quot;John is the most recognizable coach . . . the single most physical person in America. You recognize him because he's big, he's black, he's controversial, he's intelligent as hell. He isn't what some people want to think a black person is: illiterate.&quot;As aNikeconsultant, Thompson attends European trade fairs, appears in TV commercials, addresses the company's board of directors and advises Knight on issues ranging from shoe design to minority hiring.&quot;John has very strong ideas on product, and to some extent that doesn't help because his ideas are entirely different than everybody else's,&quot; Knight said, laughing. &quot;Basically he does give us certain thoughts. He's also just a great counselor in general.&quot;Knight does not seem fazed by L.A. Gear's foray into the basketball-shoe business. &quot;Everybody comes along and tries to buy their way into the market,&quot; he said. &quot;L.A. Gear's got a lot of money. But I don't believe that philosophy works by itself.&quot;Vaccaro said he rejected an offer last April to become L.A. Gear's promotions director. The shoe company turned to Management Plus, and within months Spencer had signed 15 coaches, including USC's George Raveling, the best man at Vaccaro's 1984 wedding.Raveling, who was paid $ 50,000 byNike, received $ 175,000 from L.A. Gear, an industry source said. &quot;You don't overthrow Sonny Vaccaro in one season,&quot; Bragman, the L.A. Gear spokesman, said. &quot;But we're very serious. If you want to be respected in performance [shoes] you've got to start grass roots.&quot;Jay Parker, who directs a 50-city youth basketball program in Texas, said he was so grateful when Spencer offered his leagues L.A. Gear sponsorship, &quot;I asked him if I had to rename my firstborn after him.&quot;Spencer also struck deals with Basketball Congress International, which operates youth leagues and tournaments in 36 states and four Canadian cities, the American Roundball Corp., which is represented in 29 states, and two California programs, Slam-N-Jam and Double Pump.&quot;The reason we're involved in programs like this is obvious,&quot; Bragman said. &quot;You want to get kids used to wearing L.A. Gear.&quot;BCI director Larry Walker said dozens of present NBA players once competed in his 64-team Summer Prep tournament in Tempe, Ariz. A Phoenix bingo hall owner, Walker said he forsees no problems with an agent overseeing L.A. Gear's sponsorship. &quot;Spencer . . . no, hell,&quot; he said. &quot;He's a real nice fellow.&quot;ARC President Rich Goldberg agrees. &quot;If I was dealing with [an agent] who was unethical, I'd be leery,&quot; he said. &quot;But I know David Spencer is ethical.&quot;ARC, formerly funded byNike, has a $ 266,000 contract with L.A. Gear, which includes a $ 60,000 salary for Goldberg and $ 172,000 to purchase sneakers and athletic apparel at dealer cost. ARC serves more than 9,000 boys (8 years old and up), each of whom buy -- through a league entry fee -- one pair of L.A. Gear shoes.In a letter to Spencer, Goldberg noted that the sponsorship will get &quot;numbers of traveling teams into L.A. Gear shoes and apparel at an early age.&quot; In another letter, Goldberg pledged that ARC coaches and players will &quot;strive to make L.A. Gear number one in the nation.&quot;For now, L.A. Gear is struggling: In the midst of a campaign to promote its newest basketball shoe, the Catapult, it recently reported fourth-quarter losses of $ 7.1 million. The Way It GoesThe Knight Commission will continue to examine the sneaker issue even after it announces its first recommendations later this month, Morris said. Although some coaches are concerned about the influence of shoe companies on amateur athletics, they seem determined to keep their sneaker money.In a Harris Poll on behalf of the Knight Commission released last week, 61 percent of 75 college presidents said they favored coaches' outside income being controlled by universities. But only 19 percent of 75 college basketball and football coaches favored such an arrangement.&quot;I mean, it was okay for me in my first 15 years as a coach to make $ 28,000 total in salary,&quot; said Maryland's Williams, who has coached at American, Boston College and Ohio State. &quot;You know, it was a struggle sometimes. I was living in pretty affluent areas, not making the normal standard of living. And now because I make more money, people are upset. I don't quite get that.&quot;Several years ago, Williams endorsed sneakers made by New Balance. Last year, he was with Reebok. This year, it'sNike.&quot;They're all good shoes,&quot; Williams said. &quot;There are no fly-by-night companies offering shoe contracts. So what's the big deal? This is America. You work hard in your profession, try to develop some skills, then get rewarded. That's the way it goes.&quot;",0.17681387333,0.49330522558,3322 words,NikeTown is retail theatre U.S.A.: A running start:NIKE:store aimed at middle and upper-income campers,"March 11, 1991, Monday, Final Edition",4 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"NikeInc., which has been under fire from some blacks, named John Thompson, Georgetown University's head basketball coach, who is black, to its board of directors yesterday.Nikeis one of the world's largest sellers of athletic shoes. Among its most enthusiastic customers are urban teen-agers, many of whom are black. Last year, Operation PUSH, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, charged thatNikedid not hire enough blacks.&nbsp;In August,Nikepledged to name a someone from a minority to its 11-member board within a year. Liz Dolan, aNikespokeswoman, said that adding a minority member had been planned for some time.OfNike's4,500 employees, about 8.5 percent are black, Ms. Dolan said.Nike,based in Beaverton, Ore., markets shoes that are manufactured by independent contractors elsewhere, typically in the Far East, and does not, therefore, have a large factory work force.Mr. Thompson's teams have been in every N.C.A.A. tournament since 1979 and the 1984 team won the N.C.A.A. national championship. He has been a consultant toNikesince 1980 and has spoken atNikesales meetings and coaches' clinics and made appearances to promoteNikeproducts in Europe and Asia, where they are less well known than in the United States.He was also head coach of the United States 1988 Olympic basketball team, and is the second Olympic coach to joinNike'sboard. The first was Bill Bowerman, co-founder ofNikeand an Olympic track and field coach in 1972.Mr. Thompson was not in his office at Georgetown yesterday; a spokesman for the university said he was traveling.Mr. Thompson, 49, is a member of no other corporate board. He will be paid the customary $10,000 annual director's fee and $2,000 for every bimonthly director's meeting he attends.While sales of many expensive athletic shoes have languished, those ofNikehave continued to thrive, although at a slower pace than in earlier years.

"Inside a suite in New York City's Grand Hyatt hotel, three of America's most celebrated black sports and entertainment figures were trying to make peace with Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil rights organization. Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson was there. So was actor/filmmaker Spike Lee. And Chicago Bulls all-star guard Michael Jordan.&nbsp;The three celebrities gathered on a Sunday evening last September as paid representatives ofNikeInc., the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company. Their mission: End the boycott PUSH had called againstNiketo protest its minority hiring and business practices.The meeting was scheduled afterNikeChairman Phil Knight failed to satisfy PUSH during a widely publicized session in August on the Georgetown campus. &quot;It was John Thompson's idea,&quot; Knight said of the New York meeting. &quot;I was complaining to John that we weren't getting anywhere in negotiations. John's line to me was, 'You think too much like a white man. Let me go negotiate with them.' &quot;But the negotiations failed -- and the two sides haven't met since. Now, as the largely unsuccessful boycott continues, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who founded PUSH, refers toNike'sblack endorsers as &quot;shoe salesmen&quot; who seem more interested in making money than &quot;fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;PUSH officials complain thatNike-- though its annual retail sales to black consumers total hundreds of millions of dollars -- has no high-ranking black executives and does no business with black-owned banks and advertising agencies. According toNike, 320 (7.5 percent) of its 4,243 U.S.-based employees are black. Blacks account for about 4 percent of the population of metropolitan Portland, Ore., whereNikeis based.Nikehas announced it will hire a minority vice president this year and name a minority to its board of directors by 1992. Knight said the appointments probably will be black. &quot;If we were perfect, we would've gotten that taken care of sooner,&quot; he said, adding thatNikewas formed in 1972 as a small, &quot;too male and too white&quot; company.Thompson, a $ 200,000-plus-a-yearNikeconsultant, said no organization has a right to tell another how to do business. Jackson responded in a recent interview: &quot;That detachment from ethical responsibility, that detachment from racial justice, as opposed to personal aggrandizement, is not in the best tradition of fighting for equal opportunity.&quot;The boycott has had little apparent effect onNike, whose earnings soared 58 percent last September, October and November over the corresponding period in 1989. Jackson said the PUSH boycott will continue untilNikenegotiates &quot;a joint plan for economic justice.&quot; The boycott may be difficult to sustain: PUSH, citing economic troubles, recently laid off its entire 12-person national staff.Thompson gently poked fun at Jackson last fall, giving him a pair ofNikesneakers for his 49th birthday. &quot;When Jesse opened the box, he broke out laughing,&quot; Thompson recalled. But now Jackson isn't smiling. &quot;Those sneakers,&quot; he said, &quot;they're still in the box.&quot;",0.0817535107169,0.415001055855,516 words,"Boycott or Not,NikeSales Push Upward;Jackson's Troubled Operation No Match for Thompson, Lee and Jordan","March 10, 1991, Sunday, Final Edition",8 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Bo Jackson's commercials created the impression that &quot;Bo knows&quot; the ins and outs of almost everything, especially sports. Now that the versatile athlete has been sidelined by a hip injury, one thing Bo does not know for sure is how much it will hurt his lucrative endorsement career.Jackson had parlayed his prowess in professional baseball and football into a high-profile job as a spokesman forNikeathletic shoes, earning him at least $2 million a year. The popular &quot;Bo Knows&quot; commercials played off Jackson's talents as both a star running back for the Los Angeles Raiders and an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals. In the commercials, he seemed the perfect pitchman for the company's cross-training shoes, which are cloth and leather sneakers designed for more than one sport.&nbsp;Jackson's ads, in large part, helpedNikeInc. to overtake Reebok International as the leader in the athletic shoe industry.&nbsp;Led to Other EndorsementsHis fame in theNikecommercials, created by Weiden &amp; Kennedy, a Portland, Ore., agency, also helped win him jobs as a spokesman for A.T.&amp; T. and Pepsico's Mountain Dew drink, which used a &quot;Bo Knows&quot; theme as well.But on Monday, the Royals released Jackson because of a slow-healing injury to his left hip that he suffered while playing football in January. Doctors say they do not yet know whether complications from the injury will keep him from playing for any team the rest of the year, or permanently.Sports marketing consultants said his attractiveness to some advertisers could be severely damaged, if not destroyed, if he is never able to play again. &quot;It certainly does not make sense for sporting goods companies to use an injured sports celebrity,&quot; said David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, a consulting service for ad agencies seeking sports celebrity endorsements. &quot;The calls may simply stop coming in.&quot;For the moment,Nikeis standing by Jackson. Liz Dolan, a company spokeswoman, said his injury, though serious, would probably not have a long-term effect on his relationship withNike,should he recover. &quot;This is unfortunate,&quot; she said, &quot;but we'll wait for him to come back.&quot;WhileNike'sreluctance to abandon Jackson is not surprising, the company does not have to rely on him alone.Nikehas a stable of celebrities, including Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association and John McEnroe, the tennis star. In addition, Ms. Dolan said,Nikeis always looking for young athletes on the verge of stardom.Nikestock fell as much as $3.75 yesterday before closing at $45.75, down $1.75, but the decline may have had little to do with the company's advertising prospects.Nikesaid analysts had lowered their estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings. The shares had fallen $2.50 each on Monday.Ms. Dolan saidNikehad just started work on its 1991 ad campaign, which will begin in July. She said that although no decision had been made, it was possible Jackson might be used in a humorous &quot;Bo Knows Rehab&quot; strategy for the cross-training shoes.Even if he had not been injured, Jackson would have been less prominent in the coming campaign,Nikesaid. Ms. Dolan saidNikeplanned to emphasize its basketball and outdoor cross-training shoes in the campaign and would use other sports celebrities. The company's previous campaign had concentrated on its sports cross-training shoes and had prominently featured Jackson.If Jackson does recover, but can play only one sport, probably baseball, consultants said he would still be able to do commercials. But his appeal would be limited, they said.&quot;Bo's advantage came from playing in two sports and appearing in sports stories most of the year,&quot; said Marty Blackman, a partner at Blackman &amp; Raber, a sports marketing and promotions consulting firm. &quot;With a lot of the glitter gone, his fees would certainly be reduced.&quot;Consultants said his endorsement fees, which by some estimates total about $5 million a year, could be cut by more than half if he is limited to just one sport.Some consultants said Jackson might have a hard time rounding up endorsements if he is never able to play any sport again. That would be because his career has been short; he has played professional football and baseball in the same year for four years.&quot;He didn't play long enough to become an established sports personality,&quot; Mr. Blackman said. &quot;You have to become a champion like Joe Namath to have cachet once your sports career is over.&quot;But even as a retired athlete, Jackson might be attractive to some advertisers who want to reach children. Lloyd Kolmer, the president of Lloyd Kolmer Enterprises, another consulting firm that helps match celebrities with advertisers, said Jackson was likely to continue to appeal to young people.&quot;It's a hero's story,&quot; Mr. Kolmer said. &quot;Children look up to him, not just because of sports, but because of his anti-drug and stay-in-school commercials.&quot;",0.101606753813,0.492164643635,833 words,"Boycott or Not,NikeSales Push Upward;Jackson's Troubled Operation No Match for Thompson, Lee and Jordan","March 20, 1991, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final",9 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Quit gasping about player contracts such as Bobby Bonilla's $ 29 million deal with the New York Mets. A new book, Swoosh: The Story ofNikeand the Men Who Played There, explains that sports business successes sometimes come with a lot more zeros on the bottom line.&nbsp;Nikefounder Philip Knight, a former University of Oregon runner who began with little more than an idea from one of his papers in business school, was instantly worth $ 178 million when the Beaverton, Ore., company went public in 1980.During Super Bowl XXVI,Nikesays it will debut a TV ad that pairs Michael Jordan with ''one of the most powerful icons of the 20th century.''But the company's less-cosmic early days, as shown by co-authors J.B. Strasser and her sister, Laurie Becklund, sound a lot more fun:- The company's name came to one of the founding workers in a dream. (Knight wanted ''Dimension Six.'')-Nikegot its air-cushioned shoes only because it listened to an unemployed aerospace researcher ignored by others.- An art student designed the Swoosh logo for $ 35.But in detailingNike'sups and downs, the authors are instructive. Women, not to mention minorities, were never in the management loop - even asNikewas dismissing the fledgling aerobics craze as ''fat ladies dancing to music.''AndNikeonly survived, arguably, because of early backing from a Japanese creditor - U.S. banks were too timid - and becauseNikeovercame regulatory interference from the U.S. government. Litigation becameNike'sstandard operating procedure.The authors conclude that ''the individualism that madeNikedifferent is gone, but so is the spirit that made employees care.'' Then again, today'sNikeworkers can't just do it - it already has been done.",0.195928030303,0.397121212121,293 words,New book followsNike'scorporate footsteps,"December 5, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",10 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;AFTER A PERIOD of double-digit growth in the mid-1980s, the athletic footwear market has plateaued.  In 1990 the U.S. market hit $11.9 billion on 393 million pairs of athletic footwear. That represents only a 1 percent increase in units and a 10 percent sales gain, the smallest jump since 1984.  ''The overall athletic footwear market has reached a difficult point for manufacturers, as the recession and price competition from casual shoes are having some impact,'' says Sebastian DiCasoli, SGMA's director of marketing sales.  Still, despite concern over cost, four out of every 10 shoes sold in the United States are athletic-style. In addition, DiCasoli says, the possibility of strong sales for athletic footwear looks bright because of greater participation in fitness walking and the continued promotion of outdoor and cross-training shoes.  In an effort to spur the static market, companies are continuously bringing out new shoes.  ''Without a doubt, the newest meaningful development is the system of air bladders, started by Reebok,'' says Bob Gillespie, a store manager for the Allied Sporting Goods chain. ''Nikenow has an air-pressure system and L.A.  Gear uses it in their R egulator Series.'' The air-pressure system provides the wearer with a custom fit. The shoe conforms to the foot, no matter what the configuration.  On the premise that if air can make a shoe conform to the foot it also can make a glove conform to the hand, Spalding and Mizuno have come out with baseball gloves featuring the air system.&nbsp;Gillespie says his most popular shoe isNike's$130 Charles Barkley model.  ''All the kids want it,'' he says, referring to the black low-cut shoe which makes the air bladder visible through the shoe's mid-sole.  ''There are probably better basketball shoes on the market but this happens to be the one that's hot right now,'' says Gillespie, whose store's price points are from $29.99 for a standard leather tennis shoe to $150 forNike'sAir Force 180 high top with air-system arch and ankle supports.  Popular as the air-system shoes are, one pro shop manager and buyer is not a fan.  ''I've had a lot of bad luck with pump shoes,'' says Barbara Ensner of Evansville, Ind. ''Reebok is making a pump walking shoe in which the pump malfunctions.'' Her shop does well theNike'sChallenge model, worn by top-ranked tennis pro Andre Agassi, Wilson's Pro Staff tennis shoe, and Head's Sonic, a tri-court shoe for racquetball, tennis or basketball.  Another new shoe is the $125 Brooks ''Fusion'' model, with a shock-reducing fusion plate that bends with the wearer and snaps back into place, producing a rebound effect. It's rated tops by Runner's World magazine.  ''The air bag has been around since the late '70s, but the fusion plate is newer,'' says Jim Nolan, a shoe store manager.  Nolan's best selling shoe is stillNike'sAir Jordan, named for Chicago Bulls forward, Michael Jordan. ''It's a basketball shoe,'' Nolan says, ''but 90 percent of my sales are not to basketball players.'' The Air Jordan has been the best selling basketball shoe atNikesince 1985, when the company signed the pro, according toNikespokeswoman Melinda Gable.  She says a new Air Jordan will be introduced in February that will be lighter in weight ''with a more dynamic, glove-like fit.'' In the new shoe, heavier leather has been cut away. So has some material from the outsole.  After Jan. 1,Nikewill introduce its Air Flight Mid, worn by Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls. Weighing only 14.3 ounces, the shoe has a specially constructed tongue.Nike'snew running shoe is the Air Huarache that, according to Gable, ''is so lightweight it's minimalistic.'' Made without a heel counter, the shoe features a back strapping system and sells for $110.  Cross-trainers, athletic shoes that are not sports-specific, have been popular for some time. The Sports Quarters' Nolan says he ''lives in''Nike'scross-trainers, with leather upper and air bags in the heel only.  But Gable issues a warning to those who use them for sports: ''Serious athletes should get a sports shoe.''",0.208291125541,0.531216450216,685 words,New book followsNike'scorporate footsteps,"December 5, 1991, THURSDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",11 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) - Bo Jackson's hip injury put his professional baseball and football careers on hold, but hasn't cost him a step in his other high-paying job - commercial pitchman.Ad makers for Pepsi-Cola Co. andNikeInc. have even turned Bo's injury to their advantage, pressing him into service in new advertising.&quot;What else have I got to do this summer?,&quot; Jackson says as he sits in a beach chair in a cameo appearance in Pepsi's summer ad campaign.&nbsp;He does everything but relax in the latest and probably the last edition of his &quot;Bo Knows . . .&quot; commercials forNike.In a commercial filmed at the Culver City Studios, Jackson abruptly walks out on his own Las Vegas-style show to start some serious rehabilitation in the gym. That leaves the door open for that burger-eating boxer George Foreman and others who jump at the chance to fill Bo's shoes in the lounge act.The newNikeads begin running July 9 during the All-Star baseball game telecast, the same occasionNikeused two years ago to launch the series with a commercial that also featured another famous Bo, bluesman Bo Diddley.That commercial and a 1990 ad that showed Jackson ready to compete in a dozen different sports made him one of the best-known athlete endorsers in the business and added a phrase to the American vernacular.As the rare athlete who successfully competes in two professional sports, Jackson was a natural fit forNike'scross-training shoe, designed for multiple uses - running, shooting baskets, lifting weights, riding a bike.Helped by Jackson's commercials,Nikesays sales of the shoes have climbed from nothing in 1987 to about $400 million (U.S.) this year, making them second only to basketball shoes among top-rankedNike'sbest-selling models.Consumer surveys by the research firm Video Storyboard Tests Inc. indicated Jackson was the best-known endorser from sports in 1989 and ranked him second only to football's Joe Montana in 1990. The 1991 results aren't in yet.Sports Marketing Letter rated Jackson as the 10th most sought-after sports figure by marketers this year despite the hip injury. The newsletter's publisher, Brian Murphy, estimated Jackson will make $5 million this year from advertising, several million more than he will likely make from sports.The injury Jackson suffered while playing football for the Los Angeles Raiders has prevented him from playing baseball this year. The Kansas City Royals dropped him after doctors said he might never play again, but he was signed by the Chicago White Sox.His doctors say Jackson is making progress and will be re-evaluated over the All-Star break to see if he can play baseball this season.But his injury raised questions about Jackson's commercial career. Some marketing experts said Jackson would likely fade from view as many retired athletes have if he were unable to play again. Others said his struggle back would keep people interested.Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, said Jackson remains in demand.Besides the extra work for Pepsi andNike,Woods said, Jackson is promoting lines of sports medicine and fitness products and is considering two major endorsement offers that wouldn't have been made without the injury. Woods declined to identify them.Even before Jackson was injured,Nike'sad makers had been seeking a way to give the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; series of ads a bigsendoff.&quot;The whole 'Bo Knows' thing had been overexposed,&quot; said Jim Riswold, the Wieden &amp; Kennedy ad writer who created the series three years ago. &quot;The time to end 'Bo knows' has come.&quot;Scott Bedbury,Nike'sadvertising director, agreed that he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; to see any more variations on the theme next year althoughNikewill probably use Jackson in other commercials.Riswold came up with a stylish sendoff.Jackson is the star of the &quot;Bo Show,&quot; a garish act with 20 chorus girls in White Sox or Raiders jerseys, a 30- piece orchestra and Bo's name in lights.&quot;Bo knows it's got that air thing,&quot; the chorus girls sing as they dance around Jackson, who is wearing a tuxedo and has a microphone in hand.But after a few choruses, Jackson has second thoughts. He yells for the band to stop. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he says, walking off the stage.The camera then moves to a living room where the TV set is tuned to the Bo show. Mom is shocked and Dad looks perplexed as Bo crawls through the set.&quot;I've got rehab to do,&quot; Jackson mutters as he reaches back into the set for his cross-trainers.&quot;Nice shoes,&quot; a boy sitting on the floor says as Jackson passes through the living room.&quot;You watch too much TV, kid,&quot; Jackson shoots back.In the gym, Jackson lifts weights, pedals a stationary bike and works out in the pool. He can't shake that irritating &quot;air thing&quot; song, though.&quot;You know I don't have time for this,&quot; he yells at theNikelogo.After Jackson walks away, the logo rolls up, revealing the same glitzy set where the backlights have been changed to read, &quot;Not Bo.&quot;&quot;But I do,&quot; says Foreman, dressed in a tux and surrounded by the chorus girls now dressed in boxer shorts and orange boxing gloves.&quot;Hit it,&quot; Foreman orders, as the band plays again and the girls sing &quot;George knows . . .&quot;Nikehas three other endings for use later in the year.In one version, Los Angeles Kings star Wayne Gretzky takes over from Bo, a throwback to the original &quot;Bo knows . . .&quot; ad where Gretzky was the only athlete unable to attest that Jackson could play his sport - ice hockey.The other versions end with pairs of athletes - Darryl Strawberry of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and Jerry Rice of football's San Francisco 49ers in one; Eric Davis of baseball's Cincinnati Reds and Randall Cunningham of football's Philadelphia Eagles in the other.The &quot;Bo knows . . . &quot; campaign may provide the grist for trivia games a few years from now. Jackson may turn up in nostalgic beer or credit card ads.Or the ads may have sent Jackson on the road to a long career as a celebrity spokesperson.&quot;He represents not only a versatile athlete but the whole fad of being fit,&quot; said David Vadehra, head of Video Storyboard Tests, the firm that quizzes thousands of people each year on what commercials they liked best.Sports Marketing Letter's Murphy envisions Jackson effectively pitching recreational sports such as golf, weight training or tennis.&quot;The idea has already been established in the public's mind that this is a guy who does everything,&quot; he said.",0.0488585176085,0.433845208845,1087 words,New book followsNike'scorporate footsteps,"June 30, 1991, Sunday, SUNDAY SECOND EDITION",12 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"One of the most influential characters in basketball is a pudgy&nbsp;former high school coach who counts John Thompson and Jerry Tarkanian&nbsp;among his close friends.John Paul &quot;Sonny&quot; Vaccaro has been ranked one of the 100 most&nbsp;powerful people in sports by The Sporting News. He's No. 80, right behind&nbsp;Michael Jordan.Without question, Vaccaro, 52, is the greatest sneaker salesman in&nbsp;America. He isNike'sconduit to the big-name college coaches and marquee&nbsp;programs such as Georgetown and Syracuse, signing coaches to six-figure&nbsp;contracts, some in the neighborhood of $ 200,000, for the favor of&nbsp;outfitting their teams inNikegear.&nbsp;Nikehosts summer camps showcasing the country's finest high school&nbsp;players, with all invitees approved by Vaccaro.Nikesponsors the Dapper&nbsp;Dan Roundball Classic, the granddaddy of national high school all-star&nbsp;games, which Vaccaro started in Pittsburgh in 1965.But critics have trashed Vaccaro for allegedly directing top&nbsp;recruits to college coaches under contract toNike. NCAA investigators,&nbsp;in general, are leery of his cozy relationship with both players and&nbsp;coaches.Now, in the wake of the NBA draft, Vaccaro is under attack from&nbsp;agents who claim he is cutting into their business. Vaccaro, although not&nbsp;involved in contract negotiations, has a hand in the marketing of several&nbsp;first-round picks - including Billy Owens, Dikembe Mutombo and Stacey&nbsp;Augmon, and he is negotiating with Larry Johnson, the No. 1 pick in the&nbsp;draft.All of the draft picks played at college programs under contract to&nbsp;Nike.&quot;Everything is an angle,&quot; said agent Ron Grinker, who represents&nbsp;Danny Manning, the first pick in the 1988 draft. &quot;I deal with him for&nbsp;players on shoe contracts . But now, I have to worry about him talking&nbsp;to players. He can go on any college campus where he has college coaches&nbsp;under contract and talk to every player. It's a scenario that is not very&nbsp;tasteful to me.&quot;Charles Grantham, executive director of the NBA Players Association,&nbsp;said he has been assured by Vaccaro that he will not be involved in&nbsp;negotiating player contracts. The NBA players union has no jurisdiction&nbsp;over endorsements.Vaccaro andNikeofficials deny any potential conflict, saying his&nbsp;latest business venture is independent of the athletic wear company.&nbsp;Vaccaro describes himself as a consultant for DIC Marketing, a Burbank,&nbsp;Calif., firm that has secured agreements to represent the players.&quot;I am the conduit, the go-between,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;They approached&nbsp;me a year ago and said they wanted to get involved with athletes. They&nbsp;knew I've been around athletes all my life.&quot;Vaccaro said he screened agents for some of the players, further&nbsp;raising the ire of those who couldn't get interviews. He also negotiated&nbsp;deals for trading cards on behalf of several players - among them Augmon,&nbsp;Owens, Mutombo, Greg Anthony, Anderson Hunt and George Ackles.Several agents accused Vaccaro of directing Augmon, the Atlanta&nbsp;Hawks' top draft choice, and Owens to player representative Arn Tellem.&nbsp;Vaccaro and Tellem, however, deny they have a business relationship.&quot;A couple of the agents I've heard from believe Sonny locked them&nbsp;out of a chance to get these guys,&quot; said Fred Schreyer,Nike'sdirector&nbsp;of sports marketing. &quot;I don't believe that's the case. The few players he&nbsp;is advising are kids he has been close to for a long time.&quot;Magic Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, said the only way to get to Augmon&nbsp;was through Vaccaro. He never met the player.&quot;I've been with Sonny for five years and I trust him,&quot; said Augmon.&nbsp;&quot;He's theNikeguy and he's been around our program. I met him in high&nbsp;school at the Dapper Dan, and I've been keeping close to him because he&nbsp;lives in the L.A. area. We go out to dinner. I know his wife.&quot;By conservative estimates, Vaccaro has signed more than 60 major&nbsp;college coaches - among them Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech and Hugh&nbsp;Durham of Georgia - to contracts withNike, along with more than 25 of&nbsp;the country's most influential high school coaches.The money Vaccaro can put in coaches' pockets has elevated him to&nbsp;the position of power broker. In some instances, college coaches find&nbsp;themselves earning more in &quot;shoe money&quot; than is paid them by their&nbsp;respective universities.&quot;Sonny, by his reputation, is a controversial guy,&quot; said David Falk&nbsp;of ProServ. &quot;He's got lots of contacts and can bring something to the&nbsp;party. I don't think that's all bad, but I think it threatens a lot of&nbsp;people. They feel he may have an advantage through his contacts and may&nbsp;be able to do things for players they're not able to do.&quot;Publicly, Falk is reluctant to criticize Vaccaro's dealings.&nbsp;Thompson, the Georgetown coach, is friends of both, and several of his&nbsp;former players are represented by Falk. But even Vaccaro acknowledges&nbsp;that Falk is upset that while his agency is negotiating the contract for&nbsp;Mutombo, Georgetown's latest star, Vaccaro will be responsible for the&nbsp;marketing and endorsements.&quot;This is the first time ProServ has lost a player to a marketing&nbsp;situation,&quot; said Vaccaro, who previously tried his hand as a gambler and&nbsp;rock 'n' roll concert promoter. &quot;They sort of pride themselves on what&nbsp;they've done with Michael Jordan , so they're upset about Mutombo.

"While the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan tries to blow the Los Angeles Lakers off the basketball court in the NBA finals, an Arlington inventor is putting on a full-court press against one of Jordan's biggest backers,NikeInc.Charles Petrosky, a 73-year-old inventor who works out of a cluttered shop in his basement, claims in a federal suit in Alexandria that the manufacturing giant swiped his invention when it marketed the Air Jordan sneaker, named after the Bulls' star guard.&quot;There's no doubtNikeknew about Mr. Petrosky and his idea for an air cushion sole before the introduction of the Air Max and the Air Jordan,&quot; said Joel M. Freed, Petrosky's attorney. Freed said his client patented an air cushion sole in 1978 and tried to sell the idea toNikelong before it first marketed the Air Jordan in the 1980s.&nbsp;The suit has been compared by attorneys on both sides to the case of a former Maryland man who accused several carmakers of stealing his idea for an intermittent windshield wiper now used on millions of vehicles. The Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay inventor Robert W. Kearns $ 10.2 million in that suit.Petrosky's suit, which is not expected to come to trial until the fall, seeks what could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties and penalties.Nikesaid it has sold millions of pairs of Air Jordans at a retail price of more than $ 100 a pair.Nike'srepresentatives said its Air Jordan and Air Max shoes bear little resemblance to the air cushion sole patented by Petrosky.&quot;If you look at his proposed system and you look atNike's, no one would say they are the same,&quot; said Leslie A. Nicholson, one ofNike'sattorneys.  &quot;More importantly, they work very differently.&quot;Nicholson also said that Petrosky's invention &quot;is remarkably similar&quot; to an air cushion sole patented in the early 1900s and that the suit may raise the question of whether Petrosky's shoe should have been awarded a patent.Petrosky's sole has several chambers that are connected by tiny holes. The chambers are filled using the kind of air pump and needle used to inflate basketballs.Nike'sair cushions are sealed plastic bladders that are inserted into the sole of the shoe.The theory behind each is that when the wearer walks heel to toe, the cushions redistribute the air so that the contours always provide support and a comfortable fit.Nikerepresentative Lindsay D. Stewart conceded that &quot;the little guy-big guy phenomenon&quot; is a factor in the Petrosky case and that a jury might hold more sympathy for the &quot;basement shop-style&quot; inventor.Petrosky, who was hospitalized recently for infections in his cardiovascular system, said he was eager to return to his beloved basement workshop on North Jefferson Street. Though he was given last rites recently, he has improved, and doctors have given him a favorable prognosis.&quot;When I get to feeling better, I'm going to get back at it,&quot; Petrosky said from his bed in Arlington Hospital. He said he continues to have new ideas and yearns for the days when he would &quot;get up at 2 o'clock in the morning and go down to the basement and tinker around.&quot;Petrosky's tinkering dates to the late 1940s, when he was discharged from the Army after World War II and he and a friend opened a barbershop in the Ballston area.He dreamed up a razor strop that was mounted on a support beam so the barber could sharpen his straight razor without having to use two hands. Charles T. Petrosky, the inventor's 38-year-old son, said his father failed to patent the gadget and was angry when he later saw a mounted strop advertised in a trade journal.&quot;It was the fish that got away,&quot; the inventor's son said.From then on -- especially when the elder Petrosky retired from cutting hair in 1975 -- the inventor was far more mindful of patenting his ideas. He was awarded nine patents over the years, including one for a ring with a small blade attached that could be used in self-defense and another for a system designed to rid cities of rats.Petrosky's son said his father invented the ring because he was concerned about increasing urban violence and assaults against women. &quot;If a woman slapped someone across the face with the ring on, it would scratch them -- mark them -- so that police could identify them easier,&quot; he said.The &quot;classic better rat trap&quot; sat on the bed of a truck and used bait to lure rats out of alleys, up a ramp and into a chamber where they could not escape. &quot;All the man would have to do is drop by in the morning and pick up the truck,&quot; Petrosky's son said. While the truck was being driven away, the rats would be killed by fumes pumped into the chamber from the truck's exhaust, he said.Neither invention captured consumers' imaginations, and though a few rings were manufactured, none was ever sold, Petrosky's son said.&quot;I just never got off the ground in marketing,&quot; the elder Petrosky said.Freed refused to let the Petroskys discuss the inspiration for the air cushion sole because of the lawsuit. But a 1978 newspaper article said Petrosky had pinned his hopes for fame and fortune on what he described as a &quot;walking-on-air&quot; shoe.&quot;You take a common football needle and hand air pump, and just pump away,&quot; he told the now-defunct Washington Star. &quot;A gunky substance inside seals it when you remove the needle. It's a million-dollar idea.&quot;",0.0581161616162,0.440868686869,893 words,"Inventor,NikeTo Go 1-on-1 ;Va.

"&nbsp;BEAVERTON, Ore. -NikeInc., the largest athletic apparel maker in the world, has built its business by speaking to men.  If women were eavesdropping and understood the message - fine.Nikewas happy to sell them smaller, pretty-color versions of its men's offerings.  In the industry, these are known as ''take-down'' products.  With that approach, it is little wonder thatNike'swomen's business has been only a trickle in the company's revenue stream. For the fiscal year ended May 31, it accounted for about 16 percent, or $480 million, of total revenues of $3 billion.  By comparison, Reebok International Ltd., the other industry titan, does about half its $2.16 billion annual sales in women's products.  But with the domestic men's market at its saturation point, Beaverton-basedNikehas acquired a fascination with women rivaling that of an adolescent boy.  ''Nikeis a male brand,'' says Kate Bednarski, marketing manager of women's fitness shoes forNike.''But we're now committed to growing our business on the other side of the channel.'' The commitment comes in the form of new head-to-toe women's collections - designed by women for women - and a critically acclaimed advertising campaign that says ''Just do it'' in a distinctly feminine voice heretofore unheard fromNike.Analysts and industry obser vers are generally enthusiastic aboutNike'spotential in the domestic women's market.  Overall, shoes alone in that market amount to about $3 billion annually if you figure in the whole spectrum from sneakers to highly engineered performance shoes.&nbsp;It's $2 billion if you toss out the shoesNiketypes caustically refer to as ''foot coverings.''

As he lifts weights and swims, attempting to get back in shape to join his new baseball team, the Chicago White Sox, he is interrupted by the chorines. When he refuses to rejoin them, the song-and-dance resumes with the boxer George Foreman -- another athlete on the comeback trail -- in Mr. Jackson's place.Nikeplans other &quot;Bo show&quot; spots later this summer, one featuring Wayne Gretzy of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and another featuring baseball and football players: Jerry Rice (San Francisco 49ers), Darryl Strawberry (Los Angeles Dodgers), Randall Cunningham (Philadephia Eagles) and Eric Davis (Cincinnati Reds).Also during the All-Star Game,Nikeplans to show new spots with the tennis star Andre Agassi; David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association, and the film director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the ultimate fan of Michael Jordan of the N.B.A.'s Chicago Bulls.",0.0670454545455,0.393677156177,411 words,COMPANY NEWS;NikeCountersues Avia Over Patent,"July 2, 1991, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final",24 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"When the National Sporting Goods Association's World Sports Expo&nbsp;opens a four-day run in Chicago July 15,Nikewill be conspicuous by its&nbsp;absence - and Atlanta's annual Super Show is the primary reason.&quot;We figured we were seeing 95 percent of the same people we'd&nbsp;already seen at the Super Show,&quot; said Mikal Peveto,Nike'smarketing&nbsp;manager/running apparel, in Atlanta this week for the Peachtree Road&nbsp;Race. &quot;We looked at the cost - we were spending $ 4 million in Chicago -&nbsp;and decided to put that back into the retail segment.&quot;Instead, that money will be spent on flying representatives of&nbsp;Nike'stop 100 accounts to its home office in Portland for an annual&nbsp;sales message, new product displays and other programs aimed at the&nbsp;retail market.&nbsp;Nikewill get plenty of exposure from a recently completed agreement&nbsp;with The Athletics Congress (TAC) in which the company will provide&nbsp;uniforms for the U.S. teams participating in the Pan American Games in&nbsp;Cuba, the World Track and Field Championships in Tokyo and the 1992&nbsp;Olympics in Barcelona.According to Peveto, the company will supply shoes and apparel to&nbsp;TAC, but not money.&quot;We will supply radical, bold uniforms, but uniforms that at the&nbsp;same time will be respectful of the games and the country,&quot; Peveto said.&nbsp;&quot;Nike'sphilosophy is to push the envelope, so the public will see a bold&nbsp;interpretation of our nation's colors. It will be like pro tennis star)&nbsp;Andre Agassi, an attitude. The uniforms will make a statement. The&nbsp;attitude will be aggressive on race day. That fits the attitude of the&nbsp;United States. It's an aggressive, daring, prideful country and our&nbsp;uniforms will reflect that.&quot;FOOT PATROL: While running the Peachtree 10K course last Sunday,&nbsp;Peveto occupied his mind by conducting an informal shoe count. In one&nbsp;hour, he counted more than 1,200 runners wearingNikeshoes (53 percent&nbsp;of his total;Nike'smarket share is 51 percent). By Peveto's count, 18&nbsp;percent of the runners wore Asics shoes, exactly that company's share. .&nbsp;. . Stan Clark,Nike'sSoutheast footwear specialist, says his company&nbsp;would like to increase its visibility during the Peachtree Road Race and&nbsp;will approach the Atlanta Track Club about increasing the size of its&nbsp;sponsorship. . . . According to Linda Hannon, this year's Peachtree Road&nbsp;Race Expo - moved from Colony Square to the Swissotel at Lenox Square&nbsp;along with race headquarters - was the biggest ever with more than 60&nbsp;exhibitors. &quot;This Expo is for Jane and John Runner,' and we hope they&nbsp;enjoy it,&quot; said Hannon, who coordinates the Expo. &quot;We decided Buckhead&nbsp;was a more convenient location for the runners.

"After Wieden &amp; Kennedy won the Subaru of America account, one of the agency's clients voiced an opinion widely shared among advertising, marketing and media executives: &quot;This will give them an opportunity,&quot; said Joseph W. Cece, president and publisher of TV Guide, &quot;to show that they can 'just do it' for somebody else as well.&quot;Mr. Cece's choice of words was, of course, no accident. In echoing the slogan the agency created for its largest and best-known client,NikeInc., he brought out the two conflicting implications of Wieden's long-shot victory last week in the fierce competition with Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver and four other agencies for Subaru's account.&nbsp;On one hand, the victory offers opportunities to Wieden by catapulting the award-winning Portland, Ore., agency into the forefront of the industry's most powerful and influential shops. Subaru's estimated $70 million in billings will take Wieden, with approximate current billings of $175 million, out of the ranks of midsized agencies.Yet at the same time, it presents Wieden with the challenge of demonstrating an expertise beyond the agency's ability to convince consumers that the super-athlete Bo Jackson knows footwear.&nbsp;No 'Subaru Knows' or 'Nice Car'&quot;Subaru is notNike,&quot; Dan Wieden, the agency's president and co-creative director, said in a telephone interview last week. &quot;Nor are Subaru's customers necessarily the same as those ofNike,&quot; he added. &quot;So we wouldn't try to do a 'Subaru knows.' &quot;&quot;No 'nice car,' &quot; chimed in David Kennedy, the agency's chairman and co-creative director, parodying the &quot;nice shoes&quot; line fromNike'sblockbuster commercial spoofing sports announcers, which was shown during the 1990 Super Bowl telecast.&quot;I thought they would be onlyNike,&quot; said Barbara Lippert, advertising critic for the trade publication Adweek, &quot;but they have all this wonderfully smart, exciting, crackling, hip work.&quot; She is particularly taken with a provocative new television campaign introducing a line of Anne Klein clothing. Some of the spots show a couple in bed, moving around under the covers.&nbsp;Reputation Is 'Amazing'Yet Bob Garfield, Ms. Lippert's counterpart at the trade publication Advertising Age, said that &quot;about the only Wieden &amp; Kennedy work I see is forNike,which is uniformly magnificent.&quot;&quot;It's kind of amazing that they've built the creative reputation they have on the basis of one high-profile national client,&quot; he said.Now, there are two. &quot;There's a lot to be learned for Wieden with another major account in the house besidesNike,&quot; said Scott Bedbury, advertising director forNike,which is based near the agency in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, Ore. &quot;It opens them up to a lot more consumer perspectives and a lot more client perspectives. It will balance out the agency, and that's great.&quot;Mr. Wieden agrees. Adding a client of Subaru's size -- the Subaru account will rank second toNike,which, according to Advertising Age, spent $77.5 million last year -- is &quot;a big break for us,&quot; he said, &quot;a chance to get our work known in a different category.&quot;&nbsp;Challenging a BeliefYet he and his partner take issue with a widely held belief that an agency, even one with a reputation for cutting-through-the-clutter creativity like theirs, must have an automotive account to validate its standing among its peers.As Mr. Garfield described it, &quot;I think Jay Chiat&quot; -- the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day/Mojo, the innovative agency to which Wieden is often compared -- &quot;was a lot happier after he got Nissan than before he got Nissan.&quot;Such thinking is &quot;probably one of the big problems with the industry right now,&quot; Mr. Wieden said. &quot;Less attention is paid to creative excellence than to which accounts an agency has or the size of its billings.&quot;Among top executives of other agencies, especially those based on the East Coast, there are some perceptions of Wieden as iconoclastic, aloof, perhaps even a tad arrogant. They are uncomfortable with remarks of Mr. Wieden's that rarely get uttered by heads of top agencies. For instance, he dismisses most of what is spent on advertising in the United States as &quot;a waste&quot; and &quot;ad babble, like static on the airwaves.&quot;And they point to the agency's refusal to join the industry's trade organization, the American Association of Advertising Agencies.&quot;I don't belong to the 4 A's,&quot; Mr. Wieden said, &quot;and I have no intention to. I don't mean this as arrogant, but I really don't care what the industry thinks of us. That's the wrong drummer to be marching to.&quot;&nbsp;Not in the 'Belly of the Beast'Some of the agency's &quot;best work has never been applauded by the industry,&quot; he added, &quot;and some of our worst work has. We're trying to make ourselves valid to ourselves and to our clients.&quot;Assisting the agency in staying true to itself is its location in Portland, Mr. Wieden said, &quot;and not in the 'belly of the beast,' &quot; i.e., the East Coast.&quot;I'm not saying what we're about is what everybody should be about,&quot; he added, &quot;but to exist out here and to do our thing is not to do what everyone else is doing.&quot;Yet, to help land the Subaru account, Wieden opened an office that if not in the beast's belly is somewhere near its knee, in Mount Laurel, N.J., not far from Subaru's Cherry Hill, N.J., headquarters.The agency's first East Coast office is not likely to change its character, said Mr. Bedbury ofNike.&quot;I know Dan Wieden well enough to know that if he sensed any 'contamination,' he'd get out of it,&quot; Mr. Bedbury said. &quot;His real strength lies in the road not taken, so to speak.&quot;",0.11780923994,0.55252377404,937 words,SPORTS BUSINESS: DAVID DAVIDSON; Super Show savesNike$ 4 million Chicago trip,"June 24, 1991, Monday, Late Edition - Final",27 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"NIKEshoes are having a good run at the Science Museum: on display are state-of-the-art trainers, pounds 89.99 on the high streets, the biggest draw for adolescent shoplifters and the kind of shoe kids get mugged for. The museum is not actually selling the shoes, but it has lent its name and given space to an exhibition devised byNikeas a tie-in to a pounds 1.7m television advertising campaign for its new Air 180 shoe.Strapped for cash, the museum is not trying to make a splash with the name of a commercial sponsor, however, even though it will have to drop plans for a new gallery of medicine if it fails to raise pounds 1m by the end of the year. Sports professionals may sign lucrative contracts to endorse one manufacturer's gear, but the museum is doing it for nothing.&nbsp;Caroline Kay, head of external affairs for the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, described the arrangement as: ''Utterly astonishing.Nikemust be laughing all the way to the ringing cash tills. Museums can't live in the markets part of the time and in cloud-cuckoo-land the rest, imagining they are totally pure because they haven't accepted money.Nikeis getting a great deal of commercial benefit out of this association: the museum should be selling its own excellence rather than giving it away for free.''It is not the first time that the Science Museum has run into criticism for generous product displays. Its permanent ''Food for Thought'' gallery has been slated for its reconstructions of a Sainsbury supermarket and a McDonald's burger bar. Over the road, the Victoria and Albert Museum was criticised for its exhibitions of Sock Shop designer tights and Burberry raincoats.The Science Museum approachedNikewith the idea for the ''Running on Air'' exhibition. The argument is that it is interesting, scientifically valid and relevant to the visitor who doesn't make a habit of going to museums. This is true: 12-year-old boys, several wearingNikesof their own, were measuring their feet against their sports heros' shoes last week - Frank Bruno size 12, Ian Rush a dainty 71 2 - and guessing their high street prices. ''The public never pass comment on the level of branding. I think they would complain if it were unacceptable,'' said Caroline Nolan, the museum's public relations officer. This could be because the public thinks museum exhibitions are independent creations.The general visitor would be hard put to gather that ''Running on Air'' isNike'sshow rather than the Science Museum's, when hoardings express the museum's gratitude to the company for its support rather than vice-versa. ButNikeis quite clear that it sees the exhibition as scientific endorsement of its brand image as more than a fashion shoe. ''It positions us as a serious brand,'' saidNike'smarketing services manager, Simon Taylor. ''We tried to get the exhibition up and running the day the new shoe hit the stores and we manned the stand for the first few weeks''. He could have been talking about a stand at a trade fair.''When an art gallery shows an exhibition of a living artist, that is a kind of endorsement and it has an effect on market values of the work,'' said Helen Rees, director of the Design Museum. But relations with manufacturing industry pose particular problems for museums of applied arts and sciences - relying on manufacturers as they must for contributions to their collections and up-to-date information from the front line. ''Make it an exhibition of sports shoes and people hop up and down,'' said Neil Cossons, the Science Museum's director. ''But was the museum endorsing Rolls-Royce jet engines in a previous exhibition? That was a product-related exhibition by a single manufacturer and I find it curious that people draw a distinction.'' Perhaps the distinction is that children are not in the market for jet engines. If there are controls against product endorsement by children's television, why not by national museums?If museums bring in exhibitions designed by outside - and interested - parties, perhaps they should make a clearer distinction between ''museum space'' and ''private space''. It is an option the V &amp; A will consider next year when new display areas become available at the end of their ''Japan in Perspective'' exhibition. ''If we have a major exhibition sponsor manufacturing products that are relevant to our collections, we could show additional material - perhaps from their archives - making it quite clear that it is not part of the exhibition itself,'' said Sally Mason, the V &amp; A development director.Those who argue that sponsors may try to assert control over an exhibition are probably mistaken. Patrick Greene, director of the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, where British Nuclear Fuels gave pounds 73,000 to a new energy gallery, stressed that it was not until the last minute that BNFL asked for details of what would be on display. In the event, it disagreed with some of the contents - such as a picture of a bovine Chernobyl victim that came from a Soviet newsagency. The cow stayed: ''We stressed from the start that it was the museum's exhibition. BNFL would not have dreamt of interfering,'' said Dr Greene.The greater danger could be self-censorship with a museum inclined to tone down aspects of an exhibition that might upset a sponsor. ''Self-censorship is definitely a danger and any museum needs to be aware of it, but another danger is under-valuing what a museum has to offer,'' Dr Greene said.Surely one of a museum's most valuable assets is its reputation for academic integrity untainted by commerce - the reputation that makes business want to associate with museums in the first place. Perhaps the Science Museum should ask itself whether it is selling itself cheap to the shoe industry.'Running on Air' is on until 10 May.",0.165427860538,0.426026334776,978 words,HowNikegot a run for no money at the Science Museum; Does commerce taint academic integrity?

"By Brian FawcettESQUIRE magazine, which carries the subtitle of Man At His Best butreally ought to be subtitled Upper Middle-class New York Guys Between 35and 50 At Their Most Cynical and Stylish, used to be one of the bestmagazines this side of the Atlantic. It was politically and sociallyastute if not always liberal, the prose was high-octane, and its annualDubious Achievement Awards, begun in the 1960s, were the best summary andsatire of our lunatic civilization available.These days, alas, the magazine is usually more in step with ourparanoid sectarian times than it once was, and the most I'd be willing tosay about it is that it features good prose. The April 1991 issue, whichexhibits a photo of actress Ellen Barkin, has, between pages 64 and 65, aneight-page fold-out that will tell you more about corporate sponsorship ofthe arts than the magazine intended, and probably a whole lot more thanmost of us ever wanted to know.&nbsp;On the front and back of the fold-out are miniaturized reproductions offive commissioned works of art. Charles Anderson (U.S.), Ralph Steadman(British) and Takenobu Igarushi (Japanese) are on the front, and AlphonseHoltgreve (German) and Andre Francois (French) cover the rear. All fiveartists were evidently contracted to interpret a single numerical icon -the number 180 - and to integrate it within what is presumably theirrecognizable style.THE perpetrator isNikeCorp., whose slogan, &quot;Just do it,&quot; has becomethe low-density battle cry for a generation of narcissistic physicalactivists engaged in slicking up their bodies while a third of the worldsuffers from malnutrition.The offending fold-out is an ad forNike'snew running shoe, theNike180 Air. The middle four pages are a masterpiece of high-style technicalgibberish about the new runner, done up in neo-Albrecht Durer with water-colour renderings first of the shoe, and then of a skinless foot sittingin it. Also included are a nonsensical architectural plan view of theshoe's sole, and a couple of indecipherable technical drawings aimed atconvincing us of the 180's high-tech perfection.The written text, printed in Spanish, German, Japanese and English,informs us thatNike'svaunted air-cushioning unit (a see-through shellthat contains air and thus makes the shoe lighter), has been made 50 percent larger for the 180 runner.On the two remaining pages of the fold-out are silver-tone cheesecakephotos of the new 180 in hot pink, navy and white. With its see-throughair unit, the runner doesn't quite strike me as the Ellen Barkin ofrunning shoes, who is after all, a woman of complexity and substance. The180 is actually the opposite - a testimony to the degree to whichabsolutely nothing can be aggrandized.So what am I offended at, here, anyway? Well, practically everythingabout theNikefold-out offends me. Nowhere in the eight pages does itadmit that it is an advertisement. Au contraire, the fold-out is marked &quot;confidential&quot; in five places, leading us to believe that it must be aninformation leak that Esquire somehow got hold of. That it is addressed tosomeone named T. Hatfield, a name that does not appear on the Esquiremasthead, seems to confirm this. The apparent authours of the informationleak are three guys in Beaverton, Ore., which is presumably the site ofNike'sdesign headquarters.BUT what is most offensive here is that it tells us how the corporatesector will, in the end, nurture and sponsor the arts. In this case, thework of five-star visual artists serves as the fold-out's coverdecoration, and, by implication, as an illustration of how interested inhelping out the artsNikeis.It also tells us that after a half-century of trying to integrate thearts within the communities whose values and problems they are supposed toreflect and articulate, we're headed back to the dark days when art wasn'tby the masters, but for them.Brian Fawcett is a Vancouver writer and author of Public Eye: AnInvestigation into the Disappearance of the World (Harper Collins).",0.132034632035,0.320373376623,666 words,HowNikegot a run for no money at the Science Museum; Does commerce taint academic integrity?

It has also promptedNiketo consider legal action, saysNikead manager Scott Bedbury, because ''after a callous attack, you can't sit on the sidelines.''&nbsp;The Reebok ads implicitly tweakNikeendorsers. Consumers are meant to think ofNike'sMichael Jordan when Reebok's Dominique Wilkins says, ''Michael, my man, if you want to fly first class,'' switch to Pumps. Reebok decathlete Dave Johnson says, ''I'm the man who knows cross-training,'' notNike'sBo Jackson. Reebok's Boomer Esiason is more direct: ''Boomer knows something that Bo don't know.''Nike'sBedbury says, ''It saddens us to see (endorsers) misused or abused. ... This doesn't bode well for the ad industry.''Reebok marketing vice president David Ropes says the ads just reflect reality. ''Athletes' egos are so huge they needle each other. This banter is their professional jargon.Nikeis just blowing smoke.''Where there's smoke, there's publicity - and that helps both companies. ''In the world of competitive noise, both of us benefit,'' says Reebok's Ropes.

"In a darkened conference room in suburban New Jersey, the team from Wieden &amp; Kennedy Inc. rolled out the campaign they hoped would win them $ 70 million worth of advertising business from Subaru of America.Their ads were different from other car ads. Their strategy was different from anything Subaru had done before.Fifteen minutes into the spiel, the projector jammed.''From the back of the room, Dan Wieden said, 'You get the feeling we don't do this very often?' '' recalls Chris Wackman, Subaru's vice president of marketing.&nbsp;Not exactly the slick presentation one might expect from the agency that creates ads forNikeInc., whose athletic-shoe ads are among the smoothest, hippest, star-packed spots on the airwaves. But Subaru loved it.''There was a sort of self-deprecating air to them when they came in,'' Wackman says. ''It really set the feeling that these are Subaru people. Subaru people are not highfalutin people.''Wieden &amp; Kennedy got the account.They're not highfalutin, and they're not from Madison Avenue. Since its founding in 1982, Wieden &amp; Kennedy has made a point of its slightly different worldview - the U.S. consumer as seen from its Portland, Ore., headquarters. There, they created ''Just do it'' and ''Bo knows'' and ''Nice shoes,'' won a closetful of awards that they claim not to care about and earned a reputation as the hottest of hot West Coast ad shops, an agency that made good on the claim all agencies make - to value creativity above all.But now, Wieden &amp; Kennedy has the most mainstream of clients - a car company. Its billings have gone from about $ 170 million to $ 240 million. And, to handle Subaru, it is opening an office across the continent in decidedly unglamorous Philadelphia.''It took a while to sink in. The whole employee body was in a state of shock,'' says Dan Wieden, 46, who founded the agency in 1982 with David Kennedy, 51, a co-worker at McCann-Erickson. ''It was like: Dog chases car, dog catches car, now what does dog do?''Says Dave Luhr, who oversees the Subaru campaign, already on the air: ''It's like Walden Pond, this agency: It's an experiment. No one wants to see the experiment ruined. There's a lot of concern that we do this thing right, that we don't blow it.''In fact, going after Subaru's advertising account was a carefully considered step for the agency, a rite of passage not unlike the day in 1986 whenNikeupped its spending with the agency to the then-enormous sum of $ 12 million. ''We realized, 'Jiminy Christmas, we need to be an advertising agency,' '' Wieden says. Wieden &amp; Kennedy creates ads for the Oregon Tourism Council, Anne Klein clothes and Pepe Jeans. ButNike- which, according to Advertising Age spent $ 179 million on advertising last year - is by far the agency's dominant client.''We're not eager to grow as an agency, but we did have to diversify a bit,'' says Luhr. ''We're out to prove that we can build a success story in something other than the sneaker business. That'll be good for us.''They also wanted to prove that an agency famed for its creativity could cut it in media strategy, planning where and when to run the ads to reach the right people. The agency handles only part ofNike'smedia business. For Subaru, Wieden &amp; Kennedy suggested concentrating ad spending on the regional markets where Subaru sells best: More than 80% of the company's sales are in just 68 of 210 markets nationwide.Winning the media account ''was almost as exciting as winning the creative account,'' says Luhr.Luhr is one of five emissaries from Portland assigned to carry the Wieden &amp; Kennedy culture cross-country - and teach it to the 30 new employees he is hiring to work on the Subaru campaign.''It was very important to bring some people out here so we didn't just slap a logo on the side of the agency,'' he says. Right now, the logo is a piece of paper taped to the glass door of a bland office suite once occupied by AT&amp;T - temporary surroundings that visibly embarrass the occupants.  Like most ad agencies, Wieden &amp; Kennedy views its office as a canvas on which to express its personality. ''People who visit it have to feel there's something exciting here,'' says Vince Engel, one of the creative directors of the Philadelphia office. ''It has to be stimulating.''The Portland headquarters, in a 19th-century building downtown, gets its excitement from the basketball court built in the middle - which serves as a recreation area, meeting room, party room, theater and the psychic center of the agency.So will the Philadelphia office, when they find one - preferably in an old downtown building with character. Until now, the staff makes do with a set of brightly colored plastic bowling pins lying on the floor near a bin with a sign that says, ''Recycle, dudes. Thanks.'' They've eaten a Philly cheesesteak or two. They're noticing a definite lack of plaid shirts and beards, typical Portland attire. And they endure the thirtysomething jokes: ''Everybody asks if we've taken over (fictional ad agency DAA's) office space or if we live in Hope and Michael's house,'' says Christine Barrett, who came from Portland to supervise setting up the new office.The Philadelphia agency eventually will search out new business on its own. But the umbilical cord will stay uncut. ''The last thing I want to do is distance myself from Portland,'' says Engel. ''You don't want to rely on them as a crutch. But that's the mother ship.''A filmmaker is being dispatched from Portland to shoot film of Philadelphia to show the folks back home - and vice versa. A foreign-exchange program between offices, as Dan Wieden puts it, is being planned.Though Philadelphia is on the East Coast, it's no New York - an important point to the agency. ''Philly is a different kind of city. It's stuck between (Washington) D.C. and New York, and it's fighting for its pride, and that's a good place for us to be,'' says Luhr. Like in Portland - and unlike in New York, whose residents are acknowledged to be unlike any others on the planet - ''we'll still be just as close to our target audience'' in Philadelphia, says Luhr.That closeness is part of Wieden &amp; Kennedy's appeal to clients. ''Their creative team is used to working with the same age group as we are,'' says Zoe Campbell, marketing manager for Pepe Clothing USA. ''TheNikebasis that they have helps a lot. They understand our target market.'' Sometimes they virtually are the target market: Subaru's highest market penetration in the country is in Bend, Ore., about -160 miles from Portland. Says Engel, who arrived in Philadelphia this month from ad agency Ayer/New Zealand: ''The agency is so unpretentious. Maybe that's why they understand who they're talking to better.''To keep their much-vaunted fresh perspective, Wieden &amp; Kennedy hires young people, often not from conventional advertising backgrounds, and pairs them with experienced talent. Copywriter Janet Champ started out as a receptionist, ''wasn't very good there, moved into finance, completely screwed up our books,'' Wieden says, and then went on to create ''Revolution,'' an early breakthrough ad forNike,and its acclaimed magazine ads for women.''We really wanted a place where people could come and live up to their potential,'' Wieden says.Now that the agency itself is doing the same thing, everyone's a little nervous. In an industry where ''big agency'' is usually equated with ''bad agency,'' everyone suffers ''the fear of growing too big,'' says Engel. ''We're very aware and fearful of that.''''Although we're a lot larger now, there still needs to be a sense of freedom and experimentation that's part of this shop,'' Wieden says. ''Sort of like Peter Pan, I'd like to get bigger but not grown-up.''About W&amp;KOffices: Portland, Ore., and PhiladelphiaEmployees: 160Founded: April 1, 1982Annual billings: $ 240 millionClients:Nike,Subaru, Anne Klein's A-Line clothing, Oregon Tourism Council, Pepe Jeans",0.16726571048,0.49790590362,1334 words,"Ad agency just does it //Nike,now Subaru: W&amp;K grows warily","September 27, 1991, Friday, FINAL EDITION",33 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"John Thompson, the renowned Georgetown University basketball coach, is good at what he does -- and that's not limited to coaching. He likes his players to be fine students as well as fine athletes, and in this and other ways he proves that he is a man of some values. One of them, unfortunately, is to sound like Adam Smith's parrot.Capitalism, capitalism, Thompson squawks when asked about the $ 200,000 or so he gets annually fromNikeshoes. In exchange, Thompson shoes his team inNikes. He makes public appearances for the firm. He acts as one of their spokesmen, and he tried, without success, to broker a deal betweenNikeand Jesse Jackson over minority hiring and other such matters. Even Big John Thompson doesn't win them all.&nbsp;If patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, then capitalism must run it a close second. It's often invoked as a lame excuse, an attempt to duck a moral argument by saying all ways of earning money are equal. But across town from Georgetown is the University of the District of Columbia. It's the city's public institution of higher learning, and many of its students are poor. On its basketball team is one Keith Goodie. He owns 56 pairs of sneakers.Goodie is to sneakers what Imelda Marcos was to pumps. In his addiction, he is in no way typical, but he is representative. He told The Post he doesn't know anyone who doesn't own at least 25 pairs. To this, people in the sneaker business would only shrug their shoulders in cynical acknowledgment: What else is new? They know that athletic shoes make a major fashion and status statement in the inner city. Lots of poor kids have dozen of pairs, and they are the shoes of preference for drug dealers.Jesse Jackson had his own differences withNike. But when it comes to sneakers in general, what he says makes sense. These shoes, selling for as much as $ 135 a pair, are symbolic of an urge to showboat. They are worn by kids whose pride, whose entire self-esteem, is on their feet or on their backs. They spend recklessly because they think they have no future, and they have no future because, among other reasons, they have little self-discipline. Jackson to his credit says so.It goes without saying that poor people have little money. But they often lack something else as well: a refusal to postpone gratification. Whether it's having a child when too young or squandering money on athletic shoes, this behavior is characteristic of the culture of poverty. So, too, in a way is basketball. It's a game of youth that promises an almost instant payoff for the extremely talented. But as a way out of poverty, it has the long odds of a lottery: just a handful win.Thompson and the other coaches who have contracts with shoe firms surely understand the lure of basketball and the impact famous coaches have. But instead of acknowledging that their endorsements only reinforce a destructive mentality, they proclaim a mindless allegiance to the free-market system. &quot;So all of a sudden it's a sin in this society for a person to be capitalistic?&quot; Thompson said. &quot;But as long as I live in America, that's exactly what I am going tobe.&quot;Trouble is, Thompson's role as a capitalist is in direct conflict with his role as a mentor to young black athletes and, since basketball is king, to young black males in general. When his team takes the court with everyone wearingNikes, not only do the people in the arena notice but so does everyone watching television. After all,Nikeis paying him big bucks expecting a big payoff. Here is the ultimate in false values: a team wearing a certain shoe so that the coach can make a buck.But what if Thompson allowed his players to wear any shoe they wanted? What if kids all over America could see that one sneaker is very little different from another and their obsession with name brands (at incredible profit margins) marks them as suckers? What if they gleaned the message that the shoes and their look didn't matter at all, but that performance was everything? Isn't that a lesson that transcends shoes?Of all that ails the black underclass, a weakness for expensive sneakers is hardly the most serious. But as Jesse Jackson knows, it is representative of a larger problem, one personified by a college student who squanders his money on shoes -- making rich people even richer and himself a bit poorer. In this regard, John Thompson and other basketball coaches offer nothing in the way of rebuke. In perhaps the most important respect, the coach is not coaching.",0.038135026738,0.494894745777,755 words,John Thompson'sNikeConnection,"March 14, 1991, Thursday, Final Edition",35 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"THE latest volley in the sneaker wars will be fired tonight during the Grammy Awards show in commercials for British Knights athletic shoes that use an updated version of a classic insult.The $15 million campaign, created by the Deutsch agency, uses the theme &quot;Your mother wearsNike-- choose change,&quot; to warn young buyers that wearing sneakers from the older, more established market leader is &quot;un-cool.&quot;&nbsp;Donny Deutsch, the agency's executive vice president and creative director, said the company wanted to use a twist on &quot;Your mother wears combat boots&quot; to make the point that Reebok andNikewere no longer on the cutting edge.&quot;We want to be seen as the sneakers for rebellious young people,&quot; he added. &quot;Reebok andNikehave become so mainstream they're the sneaker of choice for little old ladies.&quot;To make that point, one commercial features a group ofNike-clad, gray-haired women gossiping as they lounge around a tennis court. The spot tells viewers to &quot;choose change,&quot; then shows a lineup of flashy British Knights shoes decorated with brightly colored stripes.Another ad tells young viewers that even though they inherited their parents' genes, they need not follow in mom and dad's footsteps, implying that the only &quot;hip&quot; sneakers are British Knights.&quot;From a technical standpoint, all of the shoes are basically the same,&quot; said Larry Schwartz, an executive vice president at British Knights, which are made by Jack Schwartz Shoes Inc., New York. &quot;We think we can stand out by being more fashion-oriented.&quot;Officials ofNikeInc. did not return calls yesterday seeking comment on the British Knights campaign.The potshots from British Knights are part of an increasingly aggressive battle being waged by sneaker makers. Earlier this year, Reebok International began a campaign that taunted the athletes Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson, well-known endorsers ofNikeInc. products.In one spot for the Reebok Pump sneaker, which has an inflatable sole that the wearer can adjust by squeezing a bulb in the shoe's tongue, Dominique Wilkins, the Atlanta Hawks basketball player, says, &quot;So Michael, my man, if you want to fly first class . . . pump up and air out,&quot; as he tosses away aNikeAir sneaker, which has an air-filled sole but is not adjustable.In addition, L. A. Gear Inc. has been running a commercial for its Catapult sneaker that uses the slogan &quot;Everything else is just hot air&quot; to take a shot at theNikeAir shoe.Advertising in the $5.5 billion sneaker category has become more aggressive as growth in the market has slowed and the industry's leaders have found it difficult to gain a technological edge.Spending on sneaker advertising has risen substantially. Last year, the top three companies --Nike,Reebok and L. A. Gear -- increased ad expenditures from an estimated $70 million in 1989 to about $115 million. Mr. Schwartz, whose company is ranked No. 7 in the industry, said that on average, sneaker companies spend from 5 percent to 7 percent of total retail sales on advertising.Part of the reason for the jump in spending is the hefty fees paid to well-known athletes like Mr. Jordan and Mr. Jackson, who get $5 million to $10 million for endorsements.The flood of sports celebrities in sneaker ads has drawn criticism from some agency executives who said the glut of personalities tended to cause confusion and made it hard for consumers to remember which sports stars wore what shoes.",0.0933469308469,0.407595182595,578 words,John Thompson'sNikeConnection,"February 20, 1991, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final",36 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

''We haven't seen a lot of activity in his football cards yet.

"By JAN WONGChina may be Stalin's last stand, but communism is losing the battle inGuangdong, the bustling Chinese province closest to Hong Kong. TheCantonese have seen the future and it works. And they work, too. Trafficjams are so bad that peddlers turn a quick yuan hawking fruit in thestreet. The masses may still pedal Flying Pigeon bicycles, but the nouveauriche zip around on motorcycles or drive their own cars. You can spotthem, armed with portable phones, feasting on seafood in Canton(Guangzhou), the frenetic capital.The Chinese centre of gravity is shifting south. In 1979, in an effortto jump-start China's economy, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made Guangdonga laboratory for testing economic reforms. Deng gave Guangdong the right,for instance, to approve huge foreign investments independent of thecentral government. In 1980, he set up China's first special economic zonein Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.&nbsp;Today, three million Cantonese work in joint ventures, earning two tofive times as much as the 4.5 million workers who toil for the state. With64 million people, Guangdong ranks fifth in population among China's 30provinces and municipalities, but is first in exports, industrialproduction and foreign investment. &quot;We report to the Central Committee,but they hardly ever interfere,&quot; says Li Chunhong, one of Guangdong's neweconomic wizards. The reason: Beijing desperately needs cash to shore upailing state industries in the rest of China. Last year, for example,Guangdong paid Beijing a total of 5 billion yuan ($1 Canadian=4.7 yuan) intaxes, about 25% of the province's gross revenue.Go-go Guangdong is about as close as China gets to an independentrepublic. The Cantonese use their new-found wealth to flout Beijing's one-child limit. They have an extra child, pay the 10,000 yuan fine and justwork harder. While Beijing's hard liners forced out Guangdong's free-thinking governor, Ye Xuanping, after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, theshowdown lasted months and in October he still hadn't budged from thegovernor's residence.Charles Brown,NikeInc.'s China general manager, cites a Chineseproverb in explanation of Guangdong's free-thinking ways: &quot;The heavens arehigh and the emperor is far away&quot; (about 2,000 kilometres to the north, infact). &quot;That could well be the motto on the Canton city crest,&quot; he says.Adds a Canton-based diplomat: &quot;The Cantonese barely pay lip service toBeijing. If they do, they're being sarcastic.&quot; The contrarian Cantonesehave even embraced Mao, long on the outs in Beijing. The Great Helmsman'spicture is pasted on bus windows as accident insurance. Shopkeepersdisplay it to ward off bankruptcy. The new rich tape pictures of Mao totheir pagers. &quot;Some people are just superstitious. Others use it to showtheir displeasure with all the corruption,&quot; said Li Chunhong.State radio stations in Canton play rock 'n' roll and pointedlyannounce the time as &quot;Beijing time.&quot; The rest of China may synchronize itswatches with the capital, but Guangdong goes by Hong Kong time, partly soit can tune in to Hong Kong television shows. Disc jockeys here sign offin English with a perky &quot;bye-bye.&quot; And in a country where free speech isconsidered as dangerous as AIDS, there are even call-in radio talk shows.A recent topic: vacation hot spots, including Thailand and Singapore.Consumption is the new god of Guangdong. Billboards tout Coke, Pepsi,Dunhill cigarettes and Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. Heinz even advertisesbaby food on the schedule screens at Canton's airport. Some streets retainpolitically correct names such as Liberation Road and East Wind Street,but it's hard to find a slogan anywhere. Instead, banners exhort:&quot;Citizens have the duty to pay taxes.&quot;There is, of course, a dark side to the explosion of wealth. In thelast few years, have-nots from other provinces have flooded Guangdong insearch of work. Unlike other Chinese cities, Canton has a sizablepopulation of beggars and homeless. A sign underneath a new elevatedhighway admonishes: &quot;No sleeping under the bridge.&quot; Many blame the have-nots for the current crime wave. Outside the teeming railway station,pickpockets work the crowds. Wanted posters of thieves are plastered onbuildings. After several drivers were murdered last year, many taxisinstalled New York-style steel barriers between driver and passenger.But for the people of Guangdong, capitalism is bringing new prosperity.Factories hum through the night. In the first six months of 1991,Guangdong's output grew at an energetic 27.6%, compared with only 10% forthe country as a whole. And while the economy is expected to slow downslightly next year, to about 6% overall for China, forecasts for Guangdongsay it will continue to enjoy double-digit growth.&quot;The people here like to work,&quot; saysNike'sBrown. His company foundthat wasn't true in the rest of China. Since 1981,Nikehas opened eightfactories in China, but its best experiences have been in Guangdong. Thereit has been allowed to strike deals with Taiwanese investors.Nikenowhappily deals with Taiwanese-run factories. &quot;I would match the quality weget out of here with anything out of Asia,&quot; says Brown.To be sure, problems remain. Government officials say that foreigncompanies skim off the best workers, but don't provide pensions orhousing. And military officials fret that recruitment is down. Peoplewould rather work for foreign factories than join the poorly paid army.Nikecomplains of power outages and arbitrary import duties that varyby as much as 30% from day to day for the same item. Others carp aboutbribes to Chinese officials. Nor are joint ventures immune from meddling.M.C. Packaging Ltd., which makes soft drink cans, saw its business nose-dive after Premier Li Peng casually remarked that canned drinks were aluxury China couldn't afford. For several years, canned drink orders frompolitically correct factories, mines and hotels dried up.Despite these hassles, about 40% of China's 29,000 joint ventures havechosen Guangdong. &quot;It's easier to get things done here. There's lessbureaucracy,&quot; says Samantha Kong, acting sales manager of Avon ProductsInc.'s China venture. Avon, which began selling cosmetics in China inNovember, 1990, says initial sales were four to six times its estimates.To sop up revenues, it computerized its billing system several years aheadof schedule.M.C. Packaging said it recovered its original $18-million (U.S.)investment in 22 months. The company, owned partly by Muncie, Ind.-basedBall Corp., credits its energetic Cantonese staff. Middle managersroutinely work until 3 a.m., sometimes sleeping in the factory. &quot;In HongKong you don't have management like that. There's lots of grumbles if youask them to work hard,&quot; says Kay Mak, M.C.'s general manager.At Heinz-UFE Ltd., the Chinese partners balked at participating in asecond-phase investment of $4 million (U.S.) in 1986. But Heinz, confidentit was tapping into a dream market-millions of parents coddling an onlychild-paid the whole shot, raising its stake to 80% from 60%. In 1990,Heinz turned a profit and now churns out 10,000 tonnes of infant cereal ayear. &quot;We're selling it as fast as we can make it,&quot; says Huang Xian,Heinz's Chinese deputy general manager.State factories also enjoy greater flexibility in Guangdong. BeiZhaohan, head of White Cloud Mountain Pharmaceutical Plant, runs his 8,000workers with capitalist-style carrots and sticks. Workers use punch clocksand are paid by the piece. Technicians in research and development get twoor three times more pay than ordinary workers, a heresy in the land of thedictatorship of the proletariat.With at least 40% of state enterprises losing money, the nation'scentral planners are frustrated because they are losing control of theeconomy. The death of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union wasanother blow to the hard-line Chinese leadership. But every time Beijingtries to rein in Guangdong, the Cantonese bounce back.Some think it's hard to tell who's reining in whom these days. Willthis capitalist revolution instead transform the rest of China-and sparklasting political change? Li, the economic official, spent 15 days touringthe Soviet Union in 1989 and is convinced political reform alone doeslittle good. &quot;It's better to carry out economic reform well.&quot; His voicedrops. &quot;Then slowly have political reform.&quot;For now, politics is serenely absent from Guangdong. At M.C. Packaging,the Communist Party secretary is mainly useful in his other role as unionchief. &quot;If I want people to work on a public holiday, I just tell him andhe handles it,&quot; says Mak.

"Even if Bo Jackson's professional sports career is in limbo, Bo&nbsp;knows he can always hawk sneakers.A spokeswoman forNikeInc., provider of one of Jackson's many&nbsp;paychecks, says her company &quot;has never cancelled a contract with any&nbsp;professional athlete due to injury or illness.&quot;Liz Dolan added that there is nothing in Jackson's contract with&nbsp;Nikestipulating he has to play two sports, or even one.&nbsp;Last spring, Jackson, whose football and baseball careers are&nbsp;jeopardized by a hip injury, signed an extension withNikethrough 1993.&quot;We're not going to cut him,'' said Dolan, commenting fromNike&nbsp;headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;Our fitness center is named after Bo.

"&nbsp;Here was Michael Jordan, already America's most popular athlete, on his knees in the Chicago Bulls' locker room moments after they won the National Basketball Association championship.  He was crying. He was praying. He was so demonstratively happy that millions of viewers shared his joy. As an athlete - and as one of this country's most carefully marketed commodities - Michael Jordan rose to an even higher pedestal.  ''He transcends the sport of basketball. It's hard to conceive of him being more popular than he already was, but that's what has happened,''NikeInc.  spokeswoman Melinda Gable said.  ''He transcends sports. He transcends all traditional boundaries of athletics,'' said Jordan's personal attorney, David Falk of the Arlington, Va., based ProServ agency.  ''He transcends almost every kind of category you could put him in,'' said Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing Report. ''He is one of the few players who has built respect and admiration worldwide.'' You get the picture.  Since coming into the NBA in 1984 after winning a National Collegiate Athletic Association title at North Carolina and the Olympic gold with Team USA, Jordan has moved into his own stratosphere as a player and as a business entity.  He has built the largest ''Q Rating'' among all sports figures; that influential rating grades the public acceptance level earned by celebrities in all walks of life.  Last year, Forbes magazine listed Jordan as the eighth-highest earner among athletes, with $8.5 million in 1990 income - about $6 million of that earned off the court.&nbsp;Earlier this summer, Sports Marketing Newsletter announced that Jordan had surpassed Arnold Palmer as America's top sports spokesman with $11 million in fees. ''There could be $15 million to $17 million there for him this year if he wants to milk it,'' said Brian Murphy, editor and publisher of the newsletter.  But Falk dismisses all those figures as much too low.  ''I saw that figure where he had just passed Palmer with $11 million,'' he said. ''That's not even close. He has single deals worth more than that.  ''We expected he'd be able to do some things, perhaps take it to a little different level when he came out of college. Nobody had any idea it would become this big. We didn't think it would. Michael's pare nts didn't think it would. (North Carolina coach Dean Smith didn't think it would. Even Michael probably didn't think it would.'' Murphy said Jordan took advantage of an opportunity waiting to happen.  ''There has been a precedent for this in the past,'' Murphy said. ''A similar fuss was made for Red Grange or Babe Ruth in their eras. There are so many more channels for the image to be distributed now.  ''The whole thing was in place for him to make it happen - or somebody like him. Retailers, merchandisers realize the power of the sports connection.  There are so many more opportunities to be capitalized upon.'' Friedman said: ''Slap his name and his picture on something and it's amazing what that will give a company for his 8 percent or 10 percent cut.'' Though Jordan's popularity has never been greater, Falk said they aren't trying to cash in this summer. They are conducting business as usual.  ''The core of Michael's marketing program has been in place for five or six years,'' Falk said. ''There have been very few new companies we've associated with the last five years. We're not looking to add more companies for which he'll endorse contracts.  ''He has a limited amount of time. He wants to enjoy his family and the offseason. We don't want to bog him down with TV shoots or print shoots.  That's not to say that something won't come along that might interest him.'' So what makes Michael special? Yes, he has won NBA scoring titles, MVP awards, defensive player-of-the-year citations and now a league title. More important, it seems, is his style. In a fast-paced sport in which grace battles brawn, Jordan has been its most creative and productive force since arriving as a rookie.  In a league full of acrobats, Jordan has remained a step ahead.  ''Michael comes back each year and adds a whole new wrinkle,'' Falk said.  ''He became the NBA's defensive player of the year. They said a question mark was his outside shooting and he became a legitimate 3-point shooter.'' And when the skeptics were questioning if Jordan could win it all, he did.  Yet there is far more to Jordan's success. He projects an affable earnestness through his public appearances, media relations and commercial work.  ''You couldn't manufacture a better image than Michael Jordan,'' Friedman said. ''He has gotten a lot of good advice from the people at ProServ.'' But, Falk said, ''Michael is his own man. He has good judgment. We provide an additional layer of judgment.'' To sell their products, companies such asNike- which is estimated to have sold 20 million pairs of Air Jordan sneakers in its six-year association with him - have built Jordan's image for their own gain. The cumulative effect of those commercials has made Jordan even more attractive as a pitchman.  Look for Jordan's newestNikead on the telecast of baseball's All-Star Game.  ''Jordan wouldn't be a star unless he could do those amazing things on the court,'' Murphy said. ''But the advertising is what established him as something special. TheNikeads made him known to everybody, even those people who didn't know anything about basketball.'' America has gotten to know Jordan through his ads.  ''He is one of the few people who has a lot of deals going who doesn't look like he's overexposed, over saturated, or too greedy,'' Friedman said.  ''He's fortunate. The advertisements he's been involved with have been so well executed. The Coke spots are very endearing. So are the McDonald's ads.  Those are wonderful advertisements.'' Jordan's salesmanship has earned him criticism as well as adulation. His Air Jordan shoe became so popular that impoverished youngsters in crime-infested cities have resorted to violence to get them.  ''When you reach a higher level or success, there is a strong tendency for people to criticize aspects of what you do,'' Falk said. ''People will say these shoes are responsible for kids killing each other.'' So Jordan and filmmaker Spike Lee have been blasted for exploiting and endangering black youths with their highly successfulNikecampaign.  Opponents of the Illinois lottery have also taken Jordan to task for advertising a damaging message.  ''I wish Michael would re-evaluate his priorities,'' the Rev. Thomas O'Gorman of Chicago's St. Malachy Catholic Church told the Chicago Tribune.  ''He's not a bad person, but I would sure like to see him on TV talking about the need to support impoverished people victimized by the lottery.'' Falk equated such criticism to blaming Jordan's Chevrolet ads for auto pollution or his McDonald's ads for the dangers of preservatives.  ''If you listen to all those arguments, you couldn't endorse anything,'' he said.  Experts wonder if any athlete will be able to rival Jordan's popularity in the 1990s.  ''There is one athlete, potentially, who could approach him,'' Murphy said.  ''It's a long shot, but what if the Chicago White Sox go to the World Series and the Los Angeles Raiders go to the Super Bowl? How big would Bo Jackson be? ''In the here an d now, though, nobody holds a candle to Jordan.'' Despite Jackson's cross-training gimmick and similarly clever advertising campaigns, he can't touch Jordan's commercial revenue.  ''No one can even come close to Michael Jordan,'' ProServ's Louis Cunningham said. ''That's not a slight on Bo, Magic (Johnson or (Larry Bird.  It's just a common fact.'' Jackson may be the only baseball player who can project a charismatic, Jordan-like image. To reach that level, Murphy said, any other ballplayer would have to ''overcome that unfortunate public perception of baseball players as greedy and whining. I don't see it happening. I think when Jordan's days are done, it may be another basketball player who takes over.'' There is a chance, though, that Jordan will remain in the spotlight long after his basketball career. He dreams of playing in the PGA Tour.  ''If he goes out and becomes a success as a golfer, a mainstay on the pro tour, he could last for about 10 or 15 years,'' Murphy said. ''He would be perceived as a wonderman. It's something to think about.  ''I'm sure his agent is encouraging him to work on his short game.'' HEIR JORDAN Here are a few highlights of Michael Jordan's off-court enterprise: Industry experts estimate thatNikehas sold up to 20 million Air Jordan sneakers in the firm's six-year association with Jordan.NikeInc.  spokeswoman Melinda Gable said sales figures are confidential but did say that annual sales of Jordan's single shoe model would make the Air Jordan America's third-largest sneaker company - behind only the otherNikebrands and Reebok.  McDonald's created a short-term promotional burger - the McJordan - which it used in the Chicago region until the McLean was introduced earlier this year.  ''Anybody popular enough to have McDonald's name a sandwich after them is very popular,'' said Scott Hume, the Chicago bureau chief for Advertising Age.  ''McDonald's doesn't mess with their menu for just anybody.'' According to state records cited by the Chicago Tribune, the Illinois lottery paid Jordan $900,000 for seven hours' work on two days nearly a year apart. He appeared in television and print advertising.  ''In my estimation he's a superstar,'' lottery director Sharon Sharp told the newspaper. ''What he stands for has been tremendous for us.'' Jordan has enjoyed longtime relationships with Chevrolet, Coca-Cola and Wheaties. He also produces highlight videos with CBS and Fox; has his own line of men's wear; and has signed numerous merchandising contracts for all sorts of products, including Hang-Time Gum.  - Jeff Gordon",0.214935361073,0.513259029528,1653 words,Nikesees flat earnings,"July 3, 1991, WEDNESDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",42 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"For advertisers, 1990 was a strange year. Early on, the outlook was rosy. Ads glowed with glasnost to celebrate historic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But by fall, ads addressed more somber topics - a souring economy and the Persian Gulf crisis. USA TODAY's Stuart Elliott looks back in this review of best and worst ads of 1990:&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikehits again:Nikejust might be the most creative advertiser of 1990. The best of the best was ''Bo's family reunion.'' Few thoughtNikecould top its ''Bo knows'' spots, among the best ads of 1989. But this wildly imaginative TV ad presented 15 versions of superstar Bo Jackson, excelling in every sport from football and baseball to horse racing and golf.&nbsp;Other highlights:- ''Announcers,'' a TV ad that parodies football, sportscasters andNike'sown ads.- Two more TV ads in the Mars Blackmon series directed by Spike Lee and co-starring Lee and basketball titan Michael Jordan. They drew more praise than Lee got for his movie Mo' Better Blues.- A new campaign called ''Rock 'n' roll tennis.'' One TV ad paired Andre Agassi and the year's most unlikely pitchstars - the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a cult punk-rock band.Not every ad clicked. Someday, Mr. Rogers is going to spankNikefor the ''Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood'' ads with David Robinson. Can you say, ''Cease and desist''? Agency: Wieden &amp; Kennedy Inc.&nbsp;In the pink: Year 2 of Energizer's series of E.B. ads surpassed the fun of Year 1, when Energizer also made the Best Ads list. Just when viewers least expected it, along came the pink rabbit to march through ads that mock other ads. Targets in '90: ads for air fresheners, long-distance telephone service, soft drinks and hemorrhoid remedies.Most hilarious: an ad that simultaneously made fun of foreign films and coming attractions. It took the form of a preview for a make-believe movie called Dance with Your Feet. To complete the illusion, the ad ran in movie theaters as well as on TV. Agency: Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc.&nbsp;Politically speaking: For everyone who despairs over mud-slinging political ads, hope surfaced in Minnesota's U.S. Senate race. Deftly humorous TV ads for long-shot challenger Paul Wellstone were a big reason that he upset the two-term Republican incumbent, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.One ad, ''Looking for Rudy,'' was based on the comic documentary Roger &amp; Me. The ad followed Wellstone as he searched in vain for Boschwitz so they could debate.Another ad, ''Fast-paced Paul,'' presented Wellstone cramming all his positions into a single 30-second spot. The rapid spiel was necessary, the ad explained, because Wellstone couldn't match Boschwitz's ad budget. Agency: North Woods Advertising, adman Bill Hillsman's free-lance shop.&nbsp;Doggone clever: A TV ad for Milk-Bone dog treats put smiles on the faces of viewers by putting a smile on the face of a dog. The ad likened new Milk- Bone tartar-control products to toothpaste. The inspired video image that closed the sale: a bull mastiff sporting an enormous ear-to-ear grin. The silly sight was made possible by special effects that superimposed a human mouth onto the dog's mouth. Agency: FCB/Leber Katz Partners.&nbsp;These ads fly: The growing glut of car ads in '90 made it hard for any pitch to stand out. Kudos to Chrysler's Eagle line for ads that manage to stand out and be outstanding.The ads all are in the same style: As an announcer asks a car buyer why he or she purchased a 1991 Eagle model, there's a wry twist to a familiar joke.Sample: A man says Eagle Talon ''rated higher in overall quality of workmanship than cars like Ford Probe and Honda CRX.'' Says the announcer, actor Orson Bean: ''I'd like to see a breakdown of all the competition.'' The man replies, ''Now, let's not get spiteful.'' Agency: Campbell-Mithun-Esty Advertising.&nbsp;Comebacks: A hot trend that began in '88 - revival ads - reached fever pitch. To get the attention of baby-boom consumers, advertisers brought back familiar characters, slogans and jingles of the '50s, '60s and '70s.A warm Welcome Back to: Punchy, Hawaiian Punch's punch-drinking cartoon kid; Coca-Cola Classic's reunited hilltop choir; Nipper the RCA dog, joined by a junior puppy partner; a cartoon baby named Horton whose first words are ''Ruffles have r-r-r-r-idges''; and Joe DiMaggio back at bat for Mr. Coffee.Agencies: N W Ayer, McCann-Ericson, Ammirati &amp; Puris, DDB Needham Worldwide, Meldrum &amp; Fewsmith Advertising.",0.203031942805,0.422269775679,747 words,"Praise forNike,Milk-Bone, revival ads","January 3, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",43 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"After seven years, Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to their first NBA championship - and no one is happier than Mars Blackmon, the basketball-crazy fan of Spike Lee'sNikecommercials.Nike'slatest humorous, celebrity-packed pitch, which debuts tonight during baseball's All-Star Game, has Mars at the NBA finals at Chicago Stadium, asking his perennial question, ''Is it the shoes?'' In the ad's kicker, A.C. Green of the defeated Los Angeles Lakers, grimly concedes, ''It had to be the shoes.'' Another version shows actress Dyan Cannon, one of the Lakers' famous fans, woefully agreeing.&nbsp;Nikebought four minutes of ad time during the All-Star game to kick off a $ 35 million ''Air'' campaign that features its biggest stars: basketball stars Jordan, David Robinson and Charles Barkley, tennis star Andre Agassi, and multi-sport star Bo Jackson.The athletes all have appeared in their own series of ads, but ''We wanted to have a link,'' says Tom Clark,Nike'smarketing director. ''It's not a real heavy-handed link. ... It says, these are the best shoes by the best athletes.''The series, by agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy, includes the return of Bo Jackson in his firstNikead since the hip injury that put his athletic career on hold and, as a result, raised questions about his endorsement career.''Everybody knows what Bo's status is,'' Clark says. ''You could do an ad not addressing it, but by addressing it you connect more with the sports fan, who wants to know what's going on with Bo.''Other Air series ads, like the Jordan spots, provide a one-two celebrity punch. In an ad to run during the U.S. Open, a TV screen shows Agassi hitting the ball with such force that the TV rockets across the room. One vicious swat jars the TV's channel to a flash of Julia Child's cooking show, with the chef holding up an artichoke.

"Channel 4's documentary, Trainer Wars, is about designer sports shoes, those things which are worn as far as possible from your brain. At the peak of their popularity, I succumbed to buying a pair ofNikes, rather in the spirit in which I succumbed to buying Time's Arrow and the last Prince album: not so much because I liked these things for themselves, more because I liked the image of me having them.This idea of myself, as imparted by my pristine possessions, as a bit of a hip Londoner, a bit of a Notting Hillbilly, a bit of a Hanif Kureishi character, someone who knew ''what was going down'' and who has pressed the ''pause'' button on their individual growth at the age of 25, did give me the temporary pleasure of feeling myself a part of contemporary culture.Time's Arrow and the Prince album were, indeed, all right. However, one day soon after purchase, I was walking along in theNikes, feeling athletic and airy and cool and young and a bit like Linford Christie, when, in a street window, I caught a glimpse of a bag-lady with the squat, capable legs of an American footballer and the bouncy, strutting walk of a Harlem pimp. Since then I have not worn theNikes. Instead, I am keeping them as heirlooms: in a hundred years' time they may be worth almost as much as I paid for them.&nbsp;The sight of those great Olive Oyl feet exposed to me the idiocy of wanting to assemble one's persona from a media kit, although that does not mean that I should not succumb again were my Hip Londonr gland to be over-stimulated.  And, as I was reminded by Trainer Wars, the advertising of these absurd shoes has been magnificent. It has united youth culture's Holy Trinity of music, clothes and sport and made an unprecedentedly powerful god.Ever since the acquisition of their own identity in the 1950s, young people have been shadowed by clever salesmen: Colonel Tom Parker, Andrew Oldham, Malcolm McLaren, the boys atNikeand Reebok, all of them exploiting the desire of the young to proclaim the belief that their youth is different from anybody else's. The music, the clothes are theirs and theirs alone: banners of individuality listened to and worn by each identical young generation.&nbsp;Nikeand Reebok are, however, unprecedentedly powerful because they have brought the factor of sport into the clothes plus music equation. Sport, as we know, is taking over the world. My advice to John, Neil and Paddy is that whichever political party can enlist the support of most sportsmen will win the next election. Trainer Wars hints at sinister undertones to the designer sport shoes boys' imagistic stranglehold on youth.For example, the bigbrand names compete to sponsor basketball camps in America, in order that all players should wear their shoes and that any emergent star should be in grateful thrall to the company. The basketball player, Michael Jordan, endorsesNike'sAir Jordan, which does $200million-worth of business a year.I cannot see anything too terrible about that. What Trainer Wars implies beyond this is the insidious effect of such powerful marketing, particuarly upon black youth, the group of people at whom the product is principally aimed.Trainers are typically advertised via a black and white film with a soundtrack of incomprehensible streetwise shouting over a rhythmic banging together o dustbin lids, plus shots of young black men in baseball caps and voluminous trousers boucing down mean streets on their Zebedee-sprung shoes and looking, beyond their faint risibility, threatening and dispossessed.  There is then a coda in which a black sportsman informs the camera that these shoes give you Attitude. Music plus clothes plus sport: it equals big bucks, but does it also equal, as Trainer Wars implies, big trouble?When boys are being murdered for their trainers, as they are in America, then that is big trouble, and the documentary links the violence to the imagistic stranglehold upon today's youth by the sports shoes companies. The programme describes a dangerously heady cocktail, constantly being mixed by irresponsible bartenders, comprising the aggressiveness of rap music, the exhibitionism of fashion, the competitiveness of sport and the mindlessescapism of all three.It portrays, in effect, the misdemeanours of youth as a contemporary phenomenon rather than as an eternal constant, and it looks to lay the blame upon the makers ofNikesrather than the makers of societies. Trainer Wars is an interesting documentary.But to make sports shoes the focal point of a serious television programme is to perpetrate the power of the image that you are affecting to criticise: an unconscious stupidity, typical of an Anglo-American culture which sometimes seems as inescapably designer as theNikeAir Jordan.Trainer Wars starts on Channel 4 tonight (7pm).",0.0459851491101,0.484674122174,810 words,Earnings reports:Nikeruns up a record year,"January 17, 1991, Thursday, Late Edition - Final",49 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"MICHAEL DELL RATTACompany:NikeJapan Corp.Title: General manager, corporate planning officeNationality: AmericanHobbies: Mountain biking, photographyIronically, Michael Della Ratta's pursuit of stress relief eventually brought him to Tokyo.  While working at a consulting firm in Washington D.C. 11 years ago, he enrolled at a local Japanese martial arts school, to help work off every day stress.&nbsp;Hooked by aikido, he came to Japan to study the martial art for a year in Wakayama Prefecture, near Osaka.  Dela Ratta said he was particularly impressed by aikido's great attention to form, or kata.The characteristics of aikido may apply to Japanese business in general, he said.  &quot;The Japanese don't spent a lot of time analyzing.  Instead, they concentrate more on forming internal modes of operation, so they can react to many different situations.&quot;Since joiningNikein 1982, he has spent most of the last decade in Asia, including stints of China and Taiwan.As general manager ofNikeJapan Corp.'s corporate planning office since September, Della Ratta calls himself a &quot;cultural bridge&quot; betweenNikeInc. of the U.S. andNikeJapan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissho Iwai Corp.&quot;What I try to do is getNikeJapan on the same timetable as the rest ofNike, which is very tough,&quot; he explained.Della Ratta sees the changing lifestyles of Japan as beneficial toNike.  &quot;Now Japanese people want to get outdoors more.

"AS every red-blooded American knows, some of the most memorable design imagery over the past decade has been lavished not on buildings, but on athletic shoes.NowNike, the sports and fitness company that has brought forth Air Jordans and &quot;Just Do It,&quot; has createdNikeTown, a 12,000-square-foot store in downtown Portland, Ore. The new store, which will soon be replicated elsewhere, may do for fitness merchandising what the Ralph Lauren stores did for home design.NikeTown is modeled after a town square surrounded by freestanding pavilions.&quot;Did you see the movie 'Back to the Future'?&quot; asked Gordon Thompson,Nike'screative director. &quot;We thought the town square would be a great idea forNikeTown.&quot; If it smacks of Disney's Main Street, that too, is part of the point.&quot;We've tried to combine the merchandising concepts of Ralph Lauren, the fun of Disneyland, the exhibitry of the Smithsonian and the atmosphere of F.A.O Schwarz,&quot; he said.The store, which opened in late November, uses video screens as major design elements. Like the Lauren stores, it is a total environment. In the Aqua Gear pavilion, where waterproof gear is sold, shoes and socks are mounted in front of an aquarium. Product colors are coordinated with those of the fish.Customers try on socks around a &quot;video pond,&quot; above, composed of nine floor monitors, which substitutes video images of sharks and other creatures for water.Such achingly hip design, which includes an Air Jordan penthouse, signals a new approach to marketing byNike,which plans to open a similar store in New York next year.&quot;People want to be entertained while shopping,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;This is like a movie for people to go and see.&quot;",0.0982503607504,0.373665223665,286 words,Earnings reports:Nikeruns up a record year,"March 22, 1991, Friday, Late Edition - Final",51 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"NikeDoes It AgainWieden &amp; Kennedy Inc., the Portland, Ore., agency that coined the anthemic phrase &quot;just do it&quot; forNikeInc., has taken its own advice. It has produced one of the year's most admired campaigns -- again.&nbsp;&quot;Nikeis the high-water mark in American advertising,&quot; said Andy Berlin, a principal at Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein in San Francisco.Saluting theNikecampaign's &quot;style and 'cool' factor,&quot; Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, added that Wieden's advertising &quot;isn't just to shock or get attention; it sells the product.&quot;Among this year's lauded ads forNike:a nostalgic, low-key television commercial shown during Super Bowl XXV; print ads that talked to, not at, women, in a sensitive, respectful manner, and a series of humorous &quot;Bo Show&quot; spots, which defied predictions that Bo Jackson's football injury would end his effectiveness as aNikeendorser.&nbsp;Pepsi Gets a Prize SloganDoes Diet Pepsi have the right one, baby? Indubitably. (You were expecting &quot;Uh-huh&quot;?)The slickly produced campaign for the Pepsi-Cola soft drink, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, has spawned an upbeat national catch phrase during a less-than-upbeat year. The campaign's slogan -- &quot;You got the right one baby, uh-huh,&quot; half-sung, half-growled by Ray Charles -- has been added to the vernacular, and has been placed on Diet Pepsi containers. The advertising was &quot;a step ahead,&quot; said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York.The campaign marked another victory in its psychological warfare with Coca-Cola. Coke outsells Pepsi. But Pepsi often out-advertises and out-markets Coke.&quot;For Coca-Cola, I haven't noticed any spots all year,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York. &quot;Yet I've noticed all the Pepsi spots.&quot;&nbsp;Nuprin's Luck With EndorserFinding an outstanding campaign in the pill-and-pain category is like fishing a diamond ring out of a box of Cracker Jack. Yet J. Walter Thompson USA in New York managed that feat with advertising for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Nuprin brand of ibuprofen.&quot;Nupe it with Nuprin,&quot; the campaign urged, and consumers heeded that call to self-medicate, as sales of the brand, previously sluggish, began to rise.The campaign won praise for another rarity, signing a spokesman from the sports world who was actually well suited for the product. Of course, it was sweet serendipity that the endorser, the aging tennis star Jimmy Connors, unexpectedly stormed his way into the U.S. Open semifinals just as the campaign started.One complaint: the unfortunate play on words between &quot;Nupe&quot; and &quot;Nuke.&quot; Some say the campaign works despite that; others say that is exactly what makes the ads work.&nbsp;Auto Themes: Safe and FrugalTwo unorthodox automotive campaigns drew raves, though the plaudits were far from unanimous.For Volvo Cars of North America, Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer in New York played single-mindedly on motorists' anxieties about safety, using the theme &quot;Drive Safely.&quot; It is &quot;the best tagline,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;Very simple and very appropriate.&quot;Some executives were put off by the suggestion that parents who love their children drive only Volvos. Some also saw the campaign's attack on mini-vans as an unfair swipe at Chrysler.The other campaign was for Subaru of America's 1992 models, by Wieden &amp; Kennedy. A refreshing dose of reality infused the campaign, which debunked traditional auto-advertising obsessions with status, power and glamour. One spot, startling in its candor, depicted people who pay a lot for trophy cars as shallow, vain and deep in debt.But the campaign theme, &quot;what to drive,&quot; came under fire. &quot;It takes itself so seriously in trying to be different,&quot; said Marty Weiss, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.&nbsp;Challenge of the 90's: Credit CardsThe red-hot debate raging over the new American Express green card campaign has ad folks arguing until they are blue in the face. For now, color the prevailing judgments dark.Donny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York, belittled the advertising's &quot;spend, spend, spend, isn't-life-fun, yuppie attitude.&quot; He and others cited ads by Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. in New York that celebrate frivolities like flying the Concorde.&quot;The creative strikes me as sophomoric,&quot; said Jay Schulberg, executive vice president and executive creative head of Bozell Inc. in New York.Samuel J. Chisholm, president of the Mingo Group Inc. in New York, is &quot;not sure this approach is direct enough -- and I carry two American Express cards.&quot;Others, less negative, argue that the campaign will evolve. They say it would do better to focus on a theme found in some of the ads, which present the card as a powerful financial tool with flexible spending limits and no revolving-interest charges.&nbsp;Not Much Memorable From DetroitThis was not a good year for Detroit. Nor was it a good year for Detroit's advertising.&quot;It's no wonder G.M. is closing 21 plants, with the kind of advertising they do,&quot; said Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.Among the most castigated campaigns: the muddled, meaningless theme for Oldsmobile, &quot;the power of intelligent engineering,&quot; by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, and the nearly invisible advertising for Chrysler's struggling Plymouth division, by Bozell Inc. in Birmingham, Mich.A notable exception was the advertising by Hal Riney &amp; Partners in San Francisco for General Motors' Saturn division, which was warmly applauded for its intelligent appeals to car buyers.&nbsp;'News' Approach Raises QuestionsA series of television commercials by McCann-Erickson in New York for the Vaseline line of skin-care lotions was cited by some as a dubious achievement in deceit.The spots featured Joan Lunden, the co-host of ABC's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; in what seemed to be news reports on skin care. The spots used elements of news shows, like an anchor desk and on-screen logos, which cloaked their commercial nature.&quot;If you're trying to build credibility for a product, you don't do it by creating a fake news show,&quot; said Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre in San Francisco. &quot;You're trying to trick me, and I don't like being tricked.&quot;The pitfalls of such spots were underscored on Dec. 19, when one turned up during ABC's news magazine &quot;Prime Time Live.&quot; The network, which had barred the spots from running during news programs, apologized for the error.&nbsp;Testing the Limits on Bare FleshThe notorious, nude-filled advertising supplement for Calvin Klein jeans drew lots of gawkers. Most agreed that the emperor, too, wore no clothes.The supplement, created by Mr. Klein's in-house advertising department, was included in a plastic bag wrapped around selected copies of the October issue of Vanity Fair magazine -- a &quot;polybagged outsert&quot; in the industry's picturesque jargon. Inside, 116 pages of black-and-white photographs depicted pouty young men, pretending to be members of a rock band, preening in various states of undress.It symbolized advertising's never-ending efforts to test the limits in using sex, and skin, to sell products.  But people on both sides of that issue thought the campaign was artless.&quot;It stood for everything that missed the mark,&quot; said Donny Deutsch, creative director of Deutsch Inc. in New York. He decried the advertising's supplement's &quot;decadent sexuality&quot; as &quot;so 80's.&quot;Nat Whitten, co-creative director of Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York, termed it &quot;out of touch.&quot; His special peeve: &quot;They didn't show the models how to hold the guitars right.&quot;",0.154986414295,0.544715774769,1315 words,COMPANY NEWS;L.A.

"Bob Van Kampen confirmed Friday that his new firm,NikeSecurities, is negotiating with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates Inc. to buy its packaged products division.He said that while the deal has not yet been finalized, he expected the matter to be resolved by Oct. 1.&quot;We've been in discussions working with them and trying to come to an agreement,&quot; Mr. Van Kampen stated. &quot;I believe we are moving to a resolution, but it's not a deal yet.&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Brown, the firm's chairman, could not be reached for comment.Clayton Brown has sold about $6.5 billion of unit investment trusts since 1974, and employs 40 to 45 people in its packaged products division, according to the firm's marketing department.Clayton Brown was once a part of a firm - Van Kampen Wauterlek &amp; Co. - that Mr. Van Kampen started in 1967. Seven years later the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates.Mr. Van Kampen said he was &quot;very saddened&quot; that the confidentiality of the negotiations was &quot;breached&quot; when Clayton Brown sent an internal memo to its packaged product employees saying they would continue to be employed either at Clayton Brown or atNike.Mr. Van Kampen startedNikein May, less than a month after Van Kampen Merritt Inc., the firm he formed in 1974 and sold to Xerox Financial Services in 1984, announced it was dropping its investment banking business to concentrate on its asset management business that includes mutual funds and unit investment trusts.One municipal finance source said, &quot;He's coming back in a big way to compete with Van Kampen Merritt.&quot;A spokesman for Van Kampen Merritt did not return phone calls.As of April, the firm had sold $19 billion of unit investment trusts and was the largest U.S. sponsor of insured tax-free unit trust investments.Mr. Van Kampen said that all &quot;non-compete&quot; agreements that he made with Xerox at the time he sold the firm had since expired. He explained that the idea to acquire Clayton Brown's unit trust business occurred whenNikeacquired &quot;a key&quot; packaged product employee from Clayton Brown who &quot;felt there would be a possibility Clayton Brown would be interested in selling the whole department.&quot;Mr. Van Kampen saidNike, which is operating out of temporary quarters in West Chicago, Ill., employs 20 people - including some former Van Kampen Merritt employees - involved in the trading, underwriting and sale of tax-exempt and taxable bonds to institutional investors.The sale of its packaged products division would not have a great effect on Clayton Brown's business, according to one public finance official.&quot;They haven't been among the majors in that area,&quot; the source said. &quot;They've been focusing on public finance, doing a lot of work as a co manager.&quot;",0.00544077134986,0.30020661157,1315 words,NikeSecurities Attempting to Purchase A Division of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates,"June 1, 1991 Saturday",55 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;Bo?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least not this season for the Kansas City Royals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo Jackson, the two-sport superstar who has evolved through a series of endorsements into one of the nation's best-known athletes, was released Monday by the Royals amid speculation his careers are in jeopardy due to a hip injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is suffering from a fracture-dislocation of his left hip which has resulted in cartilage damage in the hip socket. The injury prompted Royals team physician Dr. Steve Joyce to recommend Jackson not play baseball this season. Jackson, however, said Monday he still plans to play this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury occurred Jan. 13 when Jackson was playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in an NFL playoff game against Cincinnati. Joyce examined Jackson in February, at which time Jackson asked Joyce to not tell Royals' management about the injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination came before Jackson agreed to a $ 2.375-million contract with the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has become one of sports most recognizable figures through his unprecedented on-field accomplishments as an outfielder with the Royals and running back with the Raiders, as well as a multitude of commercials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous is his &quot;Bo Knows&quot; campaign for theNikeInc.  athletic footwear company. He has also appeared in ads for AT&amp;T, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew and about a dozen other products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royals felt Jackson would not be able to play this season. By releasing Jackson before Opening Day, the team will be responsible for only one-sixth ($ 395,833) of Jackson's contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Royals general manager Herk Robinson said at the team's training facility near Haines City.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We got nearly $ 2.5-million involved in a situation like this; finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson, speaking prior to the Royals' announcement, said he did not expect to miss all of the baseball season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't count me out,&quot; he said at a press conference earlier Monday in Birmingham, Ala., where he was examined by Dr. James Andrews. &quot;I know deep down I'll be back playing baseball this year.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson was not available for comment Monday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce said he had not told Jackson his careers are over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The prognosis is uncertain,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;If some cartilage re-forms, the prognosis may be good. It's too early to give a final call on that. . . . My concern was that if he attempted to return this season too early, further damage could occur.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has been on crutches and undergoing therapy since the injury. Other doctors who examined Jackson had conflicting opinions on whether Jackson could play baseball this season and gave different time frames for a return.&nbsp;&quot;He's a great athlete. He'll get well,&quot; said Raiders managing general partner Al Davis, in Hawaii for the NFL owners meeting. &quot;We've had players with injuries like this before and they played. There are players in this league who have it. We're going to stick by him. He'll come back strong and he'll play both sports. We want him to play both.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has completed four seasons of a five-year, $ 7.4-million football contract which allows him to join the team at mid-season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Joyce's report, special X-ray studies &quot;confirmed the loss of joint cartilage space and the development of early avascular necrosis&quot; in the hip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease, in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, is not usually caused by a single injury, and is more commonly associated with older people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrews would not comment on the diagnosis of avascular necrosis, saying only Jackson had suffered a significant injury and that blood flow to the hip joint is being monitored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jackson can't play one or both sports, it could effect his endorsements bonanza.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson was found to be the most persuasive athlete in television commercials according to a 1989 survey by Video Storyboard Test, a New York advertising research firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconfirmed reports place Jackson's income from endorsements at between $ 2-million and $ 4-million a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike,which has credited Jackson's TV commercials with boosting its footwear sales from 80-million pairs in 1987 to 280-million in 1990, has no plans to end its association with Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't expect this to have any effect over the long-term,&quot;Nikespokeswoman Liz Dolan said from the company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters. &quot;Unfortunately, injuries are a part of sports. It's not likelyNikewould abandon Bo Jackson.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson last year signed a new contract withNikethrough 1993.  He does about three TV commercials a year, advisesNikeofficials on shoe design and occasionally makes appearances for the company, Dolan said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is not in his contract that he is required to play two sports,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;If he were to retire from sports, that would affect the relationship. But until Bo tells us otherwise, we expect him to play baseball next year.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injuries are not new to Jackson. He missed several key games while playing college football at Auburn, has been on the disabled list in each of the past three baseball seasons, and has had occasional injuries with the Raiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the number one draft pick of the Tampa Bay Bucs in 1986, but spurned them to play baseball for Kansas City. He later signed to play football with the Raiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royals will officially place Jackson on waivers this morning.  Other teams can claim him for $ 1 during a 72-hour period, but would be responsible for his 1991 salary. If he clears waivers, he would be free to sign with any team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawyer with the baseball players union said he did not think the Royals could properly release Jackson &quot;without substantial financial responsibility.&quot; A club cannot release a player if he is injured as the result of a baseball event. The Royals feel this is a football injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's tragic that this happened,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;Bo played a vital and exciting role in the development of sports in this country.&quot;Information from staff writer Gary Shelton, the Associated Press, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times was used in compiling this report.",0.0957737548647,0.430698762517,1082 words,Nike'srecord quarter,"March 21, 1991 Thursday",58 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Michael Jordan, a 28-year-old basketball player with the Chicago Bulls, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he does things that make you gasp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player ever to grace the court. Columnist George Will has suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-denomination dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, Jordan has had to play in a Bulls team that collapsed when the going got tough and in the National Basketball Association's play-offs, thegoing gets very tough indeed.  This year, however, the Bulls are playing the Los Angeles Lakers for the championship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is dominated by blacks. Since to play professional basketball at all you need great discipline, and to play it at Jordan's level you need extraordinary flair and imagination, it is hardly surprising that the great search for &quot;role models&quot; for black children should have fastened on the Bulls' star. Since Jordan is intelligent and articulate, notable for good sportsmanship and devoted to charitable work (though without ever seeming cloyingly goody-goody about it), he is an obvious choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a catch two catches, actually. The first is Jordan's association withNike,America's leading maker of sneakers. Jordan has been endorsingNikeproducts since 1984: the Air Jordan shoe isNike'sbest-selling line. He is not alone; other black heroes like filmmaker Spike Lee and John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown University, also endorseNikeproducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with that? According to Jesse Jackson, black America's most popular politician and a basketball fan, a lot.Nike,he argues, is promoting an &quot;ethos of mindless materialism&quot; by encouraging black children to buy sneakers (the latest Air Jordan costs $ 125) that they cannot afford. That sounds like killjoyism taken to the limit, but Jackson has a point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if inner-city children buy just one pair of sneakers; the pressure from the street is to keep up with the latest fashions. Some youngsters own as many as 50 pairs of sneakers; one 14-year-old boy told the Washington Post he spent $ 2,000 a year on shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not need to be a genius to work out one of the most likely ways in which some inner-city youngsters come by such sums: It is by selling drugs. Some drug dealers use sneakers as a way of recruiting youngsters to their gangs; some gangs identify themselves by the sneakers they wear, or accept stolen sneakers as payment for drugs. There have even been incidents where people&nbsp;&nbsp;R have been murdered for their high-fashion basketball shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike,to be fair, makes sure that its role-model endorsers like Jordan appear in advertisements warning kids off drugs and encouraging them to stay in school. But Jackson is entitled to wonder whether those messages are as strong as the ones coming from the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger catch is in the very idea of role models. Behind the search for role models lies the assumption that only great people such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X or Jordan himself are worthy of emulation. When those idols are found to have feet of clay andeveryone who draws breath does the pain of disenchantment can be profound.&nbsp;Jordan himself knows the pressure that role-modelling puts on him: &quot;I'm not a perfect person,&quot; he has said. He agrees with Charles Barkley, another NBA star, that the most useful role models for childrenare not heroes like himself but their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another drawback to role models. The majority of children have no chance of fame on the basketball court, or anywhere else. The veneration of sportsmen and women subtly denigrates more mundane but realistic goals like getting a steady job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What blacks need is not superstars but economic opportunity; and, as two recent sets of studies by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute have shown (as if the point needed laboring), anyone who thinks that they have such opportunity in the same measure as whites is deluding himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this should be taken as an excuse to denigrate Jordan's talent. But it is a shame that America's obsession with sports means that his kind of talent is celebrated more than that of other men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his city prepared for the NBA finals, Chicago magazine ran an article on Cyrus Colter, who in his long life has been one of Chicago's leading black lawyers, academics and public servants, and who, when most men would have put on the slippers, took to writing award-winning novels, short stories and poems. His has been an extraordinary tale; it is probably known to fewer than 1 percent of the young blacks who worship Michael Jordan.1991 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

"Reprinted from The Economist, a magazine published by Economist&nbsp;Newspaper Ltd. of London.New York, it was once said, has Jews, Italians and Irish, so New&nbsp;York is manic, brassy and exciting. Chicago has Poles, Croats and&nbsp;Slovaks, so Chicago is sullen, defeated and oppressed.But that was before Eastern Europe won its freedom; and before&nbsp;Michael Jordan, too.&nbsp;Jordan, 28, is the City of Broad Shoulders' latest hero. Even in the&nbsp;intense, slightly unbelievable athleticism of professional basketball, he&nbsp;does things that make you gasp.Many knowledgeable judges reckon he is the most thrilling player&nbsp;ever to grace the court. George Will, a conservative columnist, has&nbsp;suggested, tongue only half in cheek, that (along with such luminaries as&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright and Aaron Copland) Jordan's face should grace high-&nbsp;denomination bank notes.In previous years, Jordan has had to play on a Chicago Bulls team&nbsp;that collapsed when the going got tough - and in the National Basketball&nbsp;Association's playoffs, the going gets very tough indeed.This year, however, the Bulls have swept all before them. Last week&nbsp;they completed a four-game rout of the Detroit Pistons - champions the&nbsp;past two years - in the NBA semifinals. This week they will play for the&nbsp;championship. Winning a championship ring would be the culmination of&nbsp;Jordan's career.Professional basketball, more than any other American sport, is&nbsp;dominated by blacks.

MISSOURI FOOD BARN Official Says Business Returning Business dropped by about 18 percent during the first couple weeks of a strike that began March 3 but has since started to come back, a Food Barn official said in Kansas City.  P.A. Rawalt, Food Barn's vice president of human resources, said the company's business had increased by about 9.5 percent two weeks ago and another 3 percent last week.  The union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 576, has claimed business is down by 75 percent.  Rawalt also said 1,048 employees have crossed the union picket lines, which couldn't be immediately confirmed by union officials. The local represents about 2,500 Food Barn employees, about 2,100 of them union members, at 47 stores in Missouri and Kansas, most in the Kansas City area.&nbsp;The union members went on strike after soundly rejecting a new contract that would have required about $18 million in concessions over three years.

Reuters FDIC Bank Insurance Fund Shrank 37 The nation's bank insurance fund shrank 37 percent last year and will probably need to borrow $10 billion this year to keep bailing out depositors of failed banks, a top banking regulator said Thursday.  L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said the FDIC's fund suffered an operating loss of $4.85 billion in 1990.  ''To be conservative and to ensure that we have the funds we need on time, we will need, we believe, at least $10 billion this year and that could be higher if we experience conditions worse than we currently are forecasting,'' Seidman said.  He also warned that the fund may have to borrow $35 billion by the end of 1993 - part of a new Treasury proposal that would let it borrow up to $70 billion to protect depositors.  Reuters INTERNATIONAL AVIATION EC Asks For New Trade Agreement The European Community, locked in a dispute with Washington on whether its subsidies on Airbus aircraft violate free trade rules, asked Thursday for a new trade agreement to make clear what government support was allowed.  It asked the Civil Aircraft Committee of the 101-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to renegotiate GATT's Civil Aircraft Code to clarify the matter and avoid such disputes, a trade source said.  The United States charges that European subsidies to the four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium unfairly cut into the market of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The EC, in turn, says military contracts give American aircraft companies an unfair advantage.

"&nbsp;INDIANAPOLIS - In the quest to be No. 1, theNikeABCD high school basketball camp clearly was the place to be the past several days.  One hundred twenty players, considered the top high school players in the country, gathered on the courts and in some classrooms of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. Each would love to be considered the best in the land.  Several hundred college coaches gathered in the stands from the beginning of the camp Friday. All would like to win a national championship one day.  Recruiting from among those 120 players, a group that included Collinsville High's Richard Keene, holds the key to their future.  TheNikeAcademic Betterment and Career Development camp - hence the ABCD - is the most prestigious of summer basketbal l camps. It has been inviting the top 10 dozen players each year for nine seasons and has become the standard by which such camps are judged. In one respect, it is the pinnacle of a player's high school career.  In another, it merely represents a beginning.  ''Sometimes, some of these guys gear up as much for this camp as for their regular high school season,'' DePaul coach Joey Meyer said. ''They'll start working out three weeks before just with this camp in mind. For some others, it's just a summer camp.'' As the players quickly find out,Nike'scamp is anything but just another summer camp. And not simply because of the caliber of talented players and coaches who show up.&nbsp;The ''academic betterment'' half of the title occupies far more time than does the development of basketball skills at the camp, which concludes today.  ''What happens out here on the court, this is the fun part of the week,'' point guard Jason Kidd said. Going into the camp, California-native Kidd held the unofficial distinction of being the top senior-to-be in the country.  ''But this is my third year here, and I know now that the basketball isn't the most important part of this camp,'' Kidd said. ''All the time we spend in the classrooms and listening to the speakers, that's the most important thing here. They're trying to prepare us for college by telling us things we don't always hear back in school.'' Of the 56 players selected in the recent National Basketball Association draft, 13 attended theNikecamp one year.  But what of the 107 others who were at the camp that year? For them, the basketball dream is finished. They need to rely on whatever education they were able to get with their athletic scholarships.Nike,which spends nearly $100,000 each year in sponsoring the camp, has come to emphasize preparing the players more for the college experience than for the college basketball they will encounter.  Camp director Sonny Vaccaro, aNikerepresentative and former high school teacher and coach, said his vision for the camp arose from a need to help the student-athlete put basketball in a proper perspective.  ''Over the last eight years, we've learned that the reality of what it takes to succeed academically and athletically at the collegiate level is shocking to most high school student-athletes,'' he said. ''In addition to adjusting to heavy academic schedules, these blue-chip athletes, who have been treated as superstars, are not prepared to be viewed as just average college freshmen players. Our program helps them deal with this transition.  ''We impress upon the student-athletes, while they're still young, that what they do in the classroom will affect their futures more than their performances on the courts. Of course, we tell them that they have the potential to play college ball somewhere.  ''But we also tell them over and over that their basketball-playing days will end long before their lives will.'' More than anything, the camp is designed to help the athletes learn to face their responsibility to improve, both on the court and in the classroom.  On the court, that challenge to be better becomes obvious when they play with and against other all-stars. But basketball takes just a small part of each day. Each player gets just 42 minutes of court time each day in two different game sessions.  Conversely, each of them spends five hours of the day in a classroom setting.  Each athlete is pretested upon arrival for skill levels in reading, writing and studying. The results of the test allow camp officials to divide players into programs best suited to their levels. For three hours each morning, the various classes work on honing specialized skills they will need in a college classroom, from finding main ideas while reading to learning how to read college-level journals.  All of them also will get tips on taking lecture notes, improving study habits, learning strategies for exam preparation, using a college library and writing college applications.  In the afternoon, alternating with game sessions and meals, the players hear guest speakers such as Dick Vitale, the former coach and current basketball announcer; and Ed McDonald, a lawyer and former chief prosecuting attorney on the anti-crime task force. Film producer Spike Lee disappointed campers last week when he canceled a scheduled talk, but the campers still got their fill of topics such as drug abuse, financial aid, basketball and the media, and vocational choices.  The schedule each day is rigid and exhausting.  ''For a lot of these kids, it's the first time somebody is really making them toe the line,'' camp academic director Frank DuBois said.  DuBois, a counselor at Homewood-Flossmoor High in the Chicago metro area, assembled a staff of top educators to help at the camp. Their need probably exceeds that of any coach.  ''We have kids in our program right now that are reading significantly below their grade level,'' DuBois said. ''Sure, I'm shocked. And I'm disturbed. I think a lot of them do not have the ac ademic skills they need to compete with an average college student.  ''People have been telling them how great they are. They are very gifted athletes, but they are not necessarily that good in other skills.  ''In a week, I think we can teach them some tools. We can give them an idea of what college is going to be like and how demanding it's going to be to be a student-athlete. We can help them focus their energy in other directions besides basketball.'' Camp instructors such as DuBois might have an important message. But they don't have quite the appeal for the players as do counselors such as Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning, Connecticut's Chris Smith and Kentucky's John Pelphrey. And the college coaches in the stands - Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, Bobby Knight of Indiana, Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech, Lou Carnesecca of St.  John's - name the coach, he probably was there - cast an eye-catching glow.  ''I was really nervous the first time I was here,'' Kidd said. ''I was looking in the stands at the coaches more than at the players on the court, even while I was playing.'' The camp directors hope to remind the players - or maybe tell them for the first time - that they will be going to college primarily for the education and not solely to play basketball.  ''There are going to be a lot who leave here who still think that,'' Meyer said. ''There are no assurances that because they hear these things from Dick Vitale and others that their ideas will change.  ''Recruiting spoils them.'' The intentions of the camp being what they are, the recruiting aspect still draws the most attention.Nikedidn't invite any non-basketball players, and it didn't invite basketball players of middling talent but with a great need for classroom assistance.  And when Knight and Krzyzewski sat side by side in the bleachers Saturday afternoon, they weren't watching the players try to solve an algebra problem.  The coaches aren't able to talk to the players, but they can evaluate and further narrow their recruiting list.  ''I don't think there's a day in July when I'm not at a game,'' Meyer said.  ''They have crammed so much into this one month. But this really is the best place to be, with the people who are here.  ''With certain kids, it's a matter of being seen. But sometimes I wonder: How can these kids know who's here when they see the bleachers full of all those faces?''",0.161831831832,0.44452039952,1369 words,Nikestock tumbles for the third day   Higher profit still disappoints investors,"February 28, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",65 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Michael Jordan was talking about Dominique Wilkins, and the words weren't friendly.''I know what he's doing,'' Jordan said suspiciously before the NBA All- Star Game. ''When someone's on top of you, you try to knock him off. But I'm going to take a Carolina approach, and keep it clean, and stay on top.''&nbsp;What exactly had 'Nique been doing to Jordan? Body slams in the lane? Submarining him on layups?No, Wilkins had committed the sin that has been forbidden since Elvis warned the world not to step on his blue suede shoes.Wilkins is among the Reebok crew of ''pump up'' endorsers who have been needlingNikeon television ads. Air bags vs. Air Jordan.Nikehas threatened to take legal action against Reebok's leapers, a case made for a kangaroo court if ever there was one.What is it about shoes that breeds such hostility?They have been a source of easily injured pride dating to when ''Your mother wears combat boots'' still was an insult. For all her faults, what really bugged us about Imelda Marcos was her warehouse full of shoes. And those who like to tweak Nevada-Las Vegas about its courtside seats filled with high-rollers always snidely refer to it as ''Gucci Row.''Boston's Dee Brown kicked the shoe confrontation up a notch Saturday, when he paused before each of his attempts in the dunk contest to pump up his Reeboks. Dee-bok swears it was his idea, and maybe so, but somewhere a commercial is being filmed of the newly crowned slam champ.But maybe Reebok should be worried. Playgrounds are on the verge of becoming pumpatoriums. The inevitable peer pressure could lead to a new kind of game of chicken, to see who can take the most pumps. Watch out for the injury of the '90s: ankle strangulation.It's amazing how far we've come from the days when there truly was only one shoe a dignified athlete could wear. The Converse Chuck Taylor model came only in white and black. Why they bothered to have the black model was a mystery, because only the Celtics wore them and they made even the world champs look dorky.Then came the major breakthrough in the '60s. Someone in the back shop let a pair of scissors slip, and thus the low-cut was born. Wow. Two styles. This is like when Baskin-Robbins served only chocolate and vanilla.TodayNikeand Reebok are at the same kind of odds as Coke and Pepsi. One wonders how much ofNike'sjealousy has to do with the Laker Girls' collective bustline being turned into a Reebok billboard. Or that infamous but quickly pulled ad with the bungee-cord jumpers, where the Reebok-shorn guy survives but the kid clad inNikesdisappears into the abyss (kind of like going to the Sacramento Kings).Shoe battles aren't new. The first two companies to go at it - adidas and Puma - were run by German brothers named Dassler who carried on a lifelong feud.And the stakes are high, as L.A. Gear learned when it suffered a public relations disaster in December. Marquette freshman Robb Logterman drove the lane at Kansas, only to suffer a blowout the likes of which even Goodyear seldom sees. His shoe simply fell apart, and left behind in the paint was Logterman's filet of sole.It turned out Marquette was going through its L.A. Gear (Joe Montana's brand) by the gross, and within the month the Warriors switched toNike.Nikealso got the last word before All-Star weekend ended, as Jordan got a foothold on revenge.In Sunday's All-Star Game, Wilkins blew the opportunity to become the all- time ham of slam. With no defender near, Wilkins went up for one of the from- the-hip, over-the-shoulder power dunks that he invented, only to miss. This is what's called an air dunk.After seeing Wilkins suffer the ultimate showtime embarrassment, Jordan issued an epitaph for the times: ''He forgot to pump up.''",0.0983612440191,0.536007822587,633 words,Nikestock tumbles for the third day   Higher profit still disappoints investors,"May 23, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",66 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

They're shoes ready to turn a camp ing trip into ''cross-training.''&nbsp;Call it the new brown-shoe market - now that slowing baby-boomers are leaving basketball's and tennis' white-shoe market behind and are ready to pay for pricey new gear, ranging from $ 80-$ 175.Nikealready has cashed in on outdoor apparel catering to the increasing interest in backpacking, camping, trekking and mountain biking - a sport in which participation levels rose 114% between 1987 and 1989.The push into shoes, saysNikemarketer Craig Duerr, ''helps us keep going beyond the ice-pick crowd.''In doing so,Nikefaces another crowd: Reebok and adidas, who are coming out with outdoor shoe lines. First, adidas USA, which last year posted its first profit in five years, has a new Adventure line - topped by a Trekker shoe at $ 175.Reebok will use its inflatable pump system in Reebok Outdoor shoes, footwear positioned as friends of the Earth. In stores, shoes will be placed on wood instead of plastic shelves. Luckily, Reebok will plant a tree for each pair sold. ''We see the '90s as a decade of family, wellness and the environment,'' says Reebok marketer Joe Gugleilmetti. And you don't want to be caught without the right shoes for all that.Other new items at the Super Show, the largest sports products trade show in the USA:- A HOT COOLER: Coleman, the Wichita, Kan., camping gear company, offers a portable electric cooler that can be plugged into cars or homes. It can reach 40 degrees below, or 70 degrees above, outside air temperature. But versatility doesn't come cheaply. Regular coolers cost about $ 30; the new Coleman model will sell for about $ 100.- SAFE AT HOME: Lay Sporting Goods of Sandy, Utah, hopes to mechanize backyard baseball. The Chucker pitching machine, which delivers baseballs, softballs and plastic balls at up to 54 mph, weighs less (48 pounds) and costs less (about $ 500) than many pitching machines used by Little League teams. Replacement windows for your neighborhood aren't included.- TALK TO ME: CSA Inc. of South Easton, Mass., offers an expanded line of 23 exercise machines with talking computers. The chatty line includes step- climbers, cross-country ski simulators and rowers. The computers talk you through an elaborate series and calculate your pace. Or maybe they'll just keep you from getting lonely. This talk isn't cheap: The ski machines retail for about $ 500, although lower-priced machines are in the works.- MY BODY, MY SCORE: It might look just like a battery-operated, hand-held computer. But LEAP Inc. of Eugene, Ore., says its new $ 380 Individual Trainer is actually a ''personal fitness system.'' To operate, you enter information about yourself, the weather and the sport - from a menu of 120 activities ranging from aerobics to yoga. The machine rewards points for your efforts. The idea is to keep people from overdoing workouts, says LEAP's Robert Droste, because the computer lets you ''give yourself permission to stop.''- SKIP YOUR WAY TO BIGGER BICEPS: Spalding is ready to tinker with the simplest sports gear - jump ropes. Its $ 35-50 plastic SportRopes are weighted - in one-, two-, three- and four-pound models - to keep your upper body from getting off scot-free. But the ropes don't talk to you or give you permission to stop.- BRIEFLY: Coleman doesn't sell Elvis Presley cooking stoves - at least, not yet. But the company, through cross-licensing deals, offers new MTV coolers and inexpensive new kids sleeping bags depicting Captain America, Spiderman, glow-in-the-dark dinosaurs and others. ... Franklin Sports has an elaborate line of official National Hockey League street hockey gear, including neon nets for night play. ...

But the heel counter has been replaced with a rubber strap. ... Among tennis racquet marketers, wide-bodies are still seen as the way to bigger sales. Prince, for instance, introduced a Vortex model that is said to borrow from the aerospace industry. Wide-body prices are taking off - high- end models are nearing $ 300. ... It has happened: Zojirushi American Corp. introduced the ''world's first canteen-shaped stainless steel thermal vacuum bottle.''

"Listen up, Michael Jordan. Your fans at Banneker Community Center say yourNikeAir Jordan sneakers cost too much. Oh, they've been buying them. But Willie Dinkins, 16 ; Jerry Nettles, 11; and Chris Morris, 10 - your basic neighborhood kids - say $ 125 for a pair of Jordans is out of line.They're not the only ones. Serious and not-so-serious athletes are getting weary of expensive sneaks, even as sneaker companies are coming out with higher -tech and higher priced -shoes for tennis, softball, walking, running - you name it. Reebok offers its $ 159.95 Pump II this fall andNikeis adding the ''all terrain'' $ 115 Air Mowabb to a lineup that includes the $ 150 Air Force 180 basketball shoe.&nbsp;Sporting Goods Business magazine recently polled buyers and found a consumer backlash: 86% said $ 100 sneakers are a marketing gimmick designed to take advantage of consumers. Although buyers snapped up 393 million pairs of athletic shoes in 1990, making sneakers an $ 11.7 billion industry (annual revenue), more than 80% chose shoes priced under $ 35. Only 1.4% buy shoes costing more than $ 64.50, down slightly from 1989, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.Resistance to high prices could hurt an industry that has hit a wall in growth. The number of shoes sold in 1990 was up just 1.1% vs. the year before, according to the manufacturers association. That pales next to past growth: In 1988, volume was up 7.4%. The industry has kept earnings up the past two years mainly by raising prices. From 1988 to 1990, prices rose 17.7%.Consumer caution during this recession may even spur an industry wide shake out. ''There's going to be blood on the streets before this year is out,'' warns Bob Carr, editorial director of Sporting Goods Business. ''There are too many brands. There are at least 25 companies with $ 20 million or more in sales. If they don't have a niche, they're just going to founder.''Not so long ago, most people made do with one pair of $ 15 sneakers. But with today's highly touted footwear, a fairly athletic person could wind up with $ 800 worth of sneaks - the price of a refrigerator, or a fling in Bermuda.Yet consumers are not likely to abandon high-end sneakers. A small, steadfast number of athletes and aging baby boomers think $ 150 sneakers, with their air-pumping gadgets or tiny pillows of ''secret gas,'' will cushion creaking knees or help their daily run. Some teen -agers have to have their heroes' shoes, even if paying for them is painful. ''The kid will not go to school with a Ked or K mart sneaker,'' says Chuck Hinton, 57, former Washington Senators baseball player who works at the Banneker center. ''It's not fashionable.''Still, recession has been unkind to the white -collar crowd that could most easily afford $ 100 sneakers. With the threat to higher-income jobs comes an attitude change, from yuppie acquisitiveness and a penchant for labels to new respect for dollar value.That's good news for lower-priced shoes, such as Keds. The unglamorous shoe by Stride Rite has quietly moved from the rear of the pack to fourth- largest in domestic footwear sales, ahead of Converse. Keds' revenue has increased about five-fold in five years to $ 280 million in 1990.Top sneaker manufacturers spend fortunes trying to convince shoppers to buy. Most of the ads focus on top-of-the-line products like Air Jordans, which, retailers say, draw customers who may then opt for a less-expensive shoe.Nike,the No. 1 manufacturer, spends $ 100 million a year on advertising, often featuring Jordan or David Robinson, while Reebok, No. 2, spends $ 70 million.Nike,which dominates the market with revenue of $ 2.2 billion in 1990 and an expected $ 3 billion in 1991, is trying to maintain market share as growth slows among its primary buyers, men in the USA.

"Shares of United Telecommunications Inc., owner of long-distance company Sprint, sank 1 1/8 to $ 23 5/8 Monday as investors worried that Sprint may lose or have to adjust a contract with the government.The General Accounting Office claims the federal government is paying AT&amp;T and Sprint $ 148 million more in the next two years than it should. It said Sprint charges too much. That could lead Congress to force Sprint to cut rates. AT&amp;T and Sprint share a $ 25 billion contract to provide the government with long-distance phone service.&nbsp;But analysts say investor concerns about Sprint losing the contract are exaggerated. A lot of the fuss, they say, has been caused by MCI, which doesn't have a piece of the contract and keeps telling the government it could do the job more cheaply than either AT&amp;T or Sprint.Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says Sprint already has cut long-distance rates several times to bring them in line with AT&amp;T's rates. Gross says investors are worried that Sprint could lose a portion of its contract in 1993 after the contract is rebid. But that's unlikely. ''There is a rebid in the fourth year of the contract, but only between the two existing players,'' Gross says.Shoe-in:NikeInc.  gained 3 to $ 51 1/8 after the company reported a record quarter.Nikehad net income of $ 114.4 million, or $ 1.50 a share - vs. $ 99.7 million, or $ 1.31 a share, last year.

But ''price resistance hasn't hit yet,'' says Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson. ''People will continue to pay north of $ 100 for sneakers.'' Still, Jacobson is in no rush to buyNikeshares. ''Now's the time to stay on the sidelines,'' he advises. He thinksNikeis vulnerable until a recovery is evident.In fact,Nikewarned that next quarter could be weak.

"The careers of two-sport athlete Bo Jackson, an intriguing and highly recognized figure -- both on the field and from his &quot;Bo Knows&quot;Nikecommercials -- have bumped head-on into the threat of an abrupt end. The Kansas City Royals announced late yesterday they would waive outfielder Jackson this morning because of a hip injury they believe will prevent him from playing baseball this year and possibly ever again.Royals physicians also believe the injury will keep Jackson from playing any more football for the Los Angeles Raiders. However, the Raiders are hoping that is not the case.&nbsp;&quot;I don't want to speculate,&quot; Raiders Coach Art Shell said in Hawaii, at the annual meeting of the NFL owners. &quot;The doctor gave me some name of the injury . . . and [said] with rest he would be all right. . . . I don't understand all that medical language, but to me they said it was a slight dislocation. Until I hear differently I'll expect him to be able to play.&quot;As for baseball, with Jackson released, any major league team can claim him for $ 1 in a waiver period ending at 2 p.m. Friday. The New York Yankees, as the American League team with the worst 1990 record, would have first crack; their front office expressed caution pending medical analysis.Jackson, the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner as a senior at Auburn, surprised many when he announced he would play professional baseball, not football, despite being the No. 1 pick in the 1986 NFL draft, by Tampa Bay. He signed with the Royals, but in 1987 stunned them by signing to play running back for the Raiders when the baseball season ended. A prodigious home run hitter and breakaway ball carrier, last year he batted .272 for the Royals and, as usual making the switch after the baseball season, scored five NFL touchdowns.About one hour before the Royals' announcement at their Haines City, Fla., training base, Jackson said in Birmingham he feels he will return to playing baseball this year, and a sports medicine specialist who examined him did not rule out a return to football as well.&quot;Don't count me out, I know deep down I'll be back playing baseball this year,&quot; said Jackson, 28, who appeared with Dr. James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, serving in this instance as his personal physician.&quot;This action is taken with deep regret,&quot; Royals General Manager Herk Robinson said. &quot;The . . . organization is deeply appreciative to Bo for his contributions . . . We wish him and his family the very best of health and success.&quot;Robinson said the Royals would pay one-sixth of the $ 2,375,000 salary Jackson would have received had he been on the opening-day roster.&quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Robinson told the media. &quot;We [have] nearly $ 2.5 million involved . . . finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;Steve Joyce, the Royals' team physician, said Jackson has a fracture-dislocation of his left hip and the injury, sustained in the Jan. 13 Raiders-Cincinnati Bengals playoff game, has resulted in cartilage damage in the hip socket. Joyce felt that Jackson definitely should not play baseball this year, although other doctors consulted by the Royals thought there was a possibility Jackson may play again.Joyce revealed that Jackson asked him not to tell the club about the severity of the injury after he examined the athlete in February. That was before scheduled salary arbitration, which was avoided when Jackson and the club agreed on a contract.&quot;I did examine Bo prior to the arbitration hearing, and I did inform the Royals' trainer,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;But Bo did ask me not to speak to Royals management. It was a balancing act between being realistic with the Royals and being positive with the patient.&quot;Under baseball's Basic Agreement, a player cannot be released because of injury, but the Royals deem this a football injury.The Raiders' team physician, Robert Rosenfeld, would not comment on Jackson's condition. Jackson reportedly has a guaranteed contract with the Raiders assuring him $ 1,617,500 in salary and bonuses in 1991 whether he plays or not.Andrews in Birmingham did not give a specific diagnosis of the hip damage but said it is a &quot;significant injury&quot; and blood flow to the hip joint is being monitored. The doctor, who has done surgery on several major sports figures, declined to elaborate when asked about reports that Jackson may suffer avascular necrosis, a potentially career-ending condition in which bone tissue dies because blood cannot reach it.&quot;We're in a protective phase at this point,&quot; said Andrews, who left open the possibility that Jackson eventually may be able to play football again.&quot;There has been no collapse of his hip joint,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;That's the reason we're putting him on crutches.&quot;Another potential problem that faces Jackson could be his contract withNikeInc.According to NFL agents and general managers who say they are familiar with the basics of hisNikecontract, Jackson -- so closely associated with the shoe company that in February one ofNike'sheadquarters buildings in Beaverton, Ore., was named after him -- could lose as much as $ 4 million should the injury force him to play just one or no professional sports.According to the sources, the total worth of his contract is about $ 5 million (the length of the contract was unknown), but much of it is based on easily attainable incentives. Should he play only one sport, the sources said, he would get between $ 1 and $ 2 million; no sports, the sources said, about $ 1 million.Liz Dolan,Nikevice president and director of corporate communications, said there &quot;are no conditions in our contract that require him to play two sports.&quot;But Dolan quickly added, &quot;There are incentives for certain achievements, but that's not the same as conditions. Of course, he would probably get more money from playing two sports, but that's not conditions.&quot;Dolan said one such condition is that if he makes two all-star teams he would receive two bonuses. Jackson was the most valuable player in baseball's 1989 All-Star Game and has been a Pro Bowl selection in football.Asked if Jackson could lose money fromNikeif the injury forced him to retire, Dolan said: &quot;I don't want to say yes or no because it's still early.&quot;She saidNikehas no intention of canceling the contract. The firm probably couldn't even if it wanted to, as sources said most of the money is probably guaranteed. &quot;We have never canceled a contract because of an injury,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;Bo is very important to us.

A team of officers from Customs headquarters swooped on a warehouse at Sydney Airport to seize another consignment of counterfeit sports shoes.The alarm bells began ringing when Customs computers picked up details of a consignment recently flown from South Korea to Sydney.The clues added up - a suspicious importer, an infamous country of origin and an extremely vague description of contents and value.&nbsp;The importer had been given one too many chances to complete the description of goods and soon the computer alert was flashing wildly.The consignment contained sports shoes of various brands, a practice not usually carried out by legitimate distributors.When the boxes were located after an anxious half-hour, Customs officers found exactly what they had expected - 700 pairs of counterfeit Reeboks.The importer had tried to hide these by listing the runners under other brand names.The runners were in plastic bags, not boxes - a giveaway to vigilant Customs officers.At first glance, the shoes looked genuine but a closer examination revealed that country of origin tags and composition tags were missing and that the shoes were of poor quality.Some runners, with glue smeared across them, were so bad the soles could be twisted easily and the heel cup pushed in.The board linings under the inner sole were also poorly made and when the tongues were pulled back the material was frayed.Richard Janeczko , Customs' NSW import/export regional manager,said the importer, like many others involved in counterfeiting, was a small-time entrepreneur obviously planning to sell the runners at weekend markets.Footwear experts have warned they can be damaging to the feet. But in many cases Customs are unable to act to keep these fakes off the street. Australia's leading importers are now rushing to take out protection under the Trademarks Act which gives Customs the power they need.CUSTOMS officials believe many of the counterfeit goods originate from the mainly Asian factories of the legitimate manufacturers, where &quot;moonlighting&quot;workers make the fakes from leftover pieces of the genuine shoes.&quot;These shoes would probably sell for around $50, well under half the price the genuine product would sell for with a legitimate dealer,&quot; Mr Janeczko said.&quot;I simply cannot believe the gullibility of the public who buy runners at prices they should realise cannot be genuine.&quot;Designer label runners, the fashion statement of the 90s, can cost up $300to with most pairs selling for around $150.Counterfeit pairs sell for between $40 and $100 at markets and while the public may believe they are coming out the winner, the runners may cost as little as $6 to produce.&quot;Obviously many of the runners fall apart within a matter of days or weeks and the damage to our reputation is as great as the potential loss of revenue,&quot; said Keith Forbes, a spokesman from Reebok.REEBOK, the best-known brand, has been the main target for counterfeiters and Reebok International spends millions of dollars every year on litigation.The Australian company has joined several high-profile designers and manufacturers to create the Anti-Counterfeit Action Group to lobby for increased penalties and monitor counterfeit activities.&quot;I would estimate Reebok and other importers in this country are losing up to $8 million each year to the counterfeit industry,&quot; Mr Forbes said.&quot;If you buy a pair of Reeboks or other runners at the weekend markets, chances are you will walk away with a counterfeit pair. I would say it's a 99.9 per cent chance.&quot;Adidas controller John Warnock said his company would not like to speculate on the size of the counterfeit industry.&quot;What turns up in Customs raids could be just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.Mr Forbes believes Reebok has frightened off a number of counterfeiters who are now attempting to join the market with fake Adidas andNikerunners which have only recently begun appearing in Customs raids.IN the past two months, Customs officers have been concentrating on imports of runners from South Korea.In one raid 2,100 pairs of fake sports shoes were found in a container of goods - 600 pairs of fake Reeboks and Adidas and 1,500 brandedNike.Another raid turned up 720 pairs of fake Reeboks.Such raids have promptedNiketo join Reebok, Adidas and others to seek protection under the Trademarks Act giving Customs the power to investigate and seize imports of counterfeit products.&quot;Because of the number of shoes Customs are turning up in their investigations,Nikefelt if was obliged to take immediate steps for protection,&quot; saidNikesolicitor Simon Williams.In the consignment Customs seized last week officers found, apart from the 700 fake Reeboks, brands of runners which, likeNike, were not covered under the Trademarks Act.These possibly counterfeit runners also had country of origin and composition tags missing.Customs will hold these brands until the importer attaches these tags to meet import regulations. Customs cannot take action to keep the runners off the market because the brands are not covered under the Trademarks Act.The &quot;Reebok&quot; runners will be held pending charges against the importer of breach of Copyright Act which could lead to fines of up to $1,000 and the runners being destroyed.HOW TO SPOT A FAKE RUNNER1 Poor quality finish.2 Weak heel cup.3 Weak sole.4 Missing country of origin tag and composition tag.5 Plastic or vinyl instead of leather.6 Frayed material under tongue.7 Poor quality board lining under inner sole.8 Genuine Reeboks should have size tag under or on side of tongue with US, UK and European sizes and factory codes.",-0.0346200980392,0.461011904762,939 words,NikeProfit Rises by 6%,"May 21, 1991, Tuesday, City Edition",77 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;The state of Missouri currently has a model for the non-graded primary school.AtNikeElementary in Catawissa, students who have previously been bound to a traditional kindergarten-through-third-grade program are now offered a 3- , 4- or 5-year program. This non-graded approach allows teachers to move children through a continuous curriculum, allowing the developmental differences.  The overall goal is to ensure that all children reach their academic potential.  Although the non-graded program has been compared to the one-room schoolhouse, marked differences exist. Age groups and grades are clearly identified, and preset graded curriculums are taught year to year in a rigid format.  As large numbers of students began to attend, school rooms were added to existing buildings, and the different grades were split apart. This more closely aligns the one-room concept to our traditional graded schools of today. Certainly much cross-age learning occurred. Younger pupils learned from listening to older classes, and older students having problems could listen as presentations were made to younger classes. Much peer tutoring was employed, both as a help for the teacher and because the children enjoyed working together.  Today's non-graded program seeks to define sets of learner objectives that allow for developmental difference s of children. Learning strategies and materials to accommodate the flexible time provisions of non-graded classrooms can be varied and diverse. What they have in common is an understanding of how to determine when the child is academically ready to move from level to level.&nbsp;In a non-graded primary school, there is no repeating of a grade because of academic failure. Instead of retention, students are taught at a pace that ensures academic success and growth. A child may take five years to complete the traditional K-3 program, but it occurs by progressing through the primary levels at a slower pace. Teachers do not have to subvert the system to fit the child's needs but can use flexible time provisions to move a child at any time that child has met the academic criteria for each level. A three-year program is also offered atNikeallowing a student to accelerate through the program with academic successes. The curriculum is flexible, expanding to challenge all children.  The developers ofNike'snon-graded primary - myself, Barb Betz and Jean Wills - have broadened the curriculum to meet student needs. They have embraced a variety of teaching strategies including cooperative learning, cross-age tutoring, extensive use of volunteers, continuous assessment and mastery learning to help each child achieve academic successes. We have not addressed or cured all the problems that face our educational system, but we believe we have taken a step in the right direction.  Karen M.

"&nbsp;Random observations from the wide, wide world of television sports: - Bo Jackson came through a television the other night. Walked right through the sucker in an effort to express his utter disgust with the medium, one supposes.  Of course, it wasn't real. It was merely another in a seemingly endless series of clever (and somewhat disturbing)Niketelevision commercials.  Do we know Bo in any other way?  Anyway, in this one Jackson spoofs his image (created in previous commercials, naturally) that he can do anything. In the middle of the spot, Bo walks off a lavish stage set, complete with musicians and beautiful back-up singers.  He walks right through a TV set into a living room, where he chides a little boy who is sitting there for watching too much television. He then heads to a gym where he is shown going about the difficult business of rehabilitating his career.  The career that exists outside of commercials, that is.  The message, presumably, is that what Bo is really all about is hard work and sweat, which is not exactly whatNikewas saying in its earlier ''Bo knows'' commercials. No, those implied that everything from hockey to rocket science came naturally to this wondrous athlete.  This time, there's work involved and since the product being advertised is something worn in weight rooms and gymnasiums, it makes sense to finally put Jackson in such a setting. The message about hard work was equally welcome and Tuesday's All-Star game was a great place for the spot to make its debut.&nbsp;But let's pause here for a healthy dose of cynicism. Bo Jackson chastising a kid for watching too much television? Bo Jackson telling us that image is not everything? Who's kidding who? Not that it is Jackson's fault, but no athlete has been dominated by his TV image more than Jackson. Jackson's pro sports career, as spectacular as it was in brief spurts, could not compete with Jackson's TV image.  Most athletes need to be at or near the top of their games to sustain a career in commercial endorsements. All Jackson had to do w as be Bo.  This advertisement is proof of that. Jackson has yet to play an inning - and may never play an inning - in a Chicago White Sox uniform, and yet his Sox uniform (stylishly black, of course) is featured prominently in this advertisement.  Bo does not have any White Sox RBIs, but he does have a White Sox image.  Thanks toNike.Of course, image is whatNikeis selling, every bit as much as sneakers.  Images perpetrated by TV commercials. Images consumed willingly by little kids (and big ones, too) who watch too much TV.  Should we listen to Bo and not watch so much TV and go out and ''just do it''? Or, should we just sit back and be overwhelmed by the amazing and attractive image of Bo?Nikeis telling us to do the former while cleverly enticing us to do the latter.",0.106260262726,0.446633825944,475 words,BO'S LATESTNIKECOMMERCIAL DELIVERS A MIXED MESSAGE,"February 19, 1991, Tuesday, FINAL EDITION",84 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Jacobson says he's looking for only 9% earnings growth to $ 4.15 a share - not the big double-digit growth investors saw in previous years.Still, Jacobson and First Albany analyst Todd Berko say the company has bright prospects ahead internationally, where trends lag three years behind the USA. ''It's an incredibly well-managed company that's had an incredible string of successes the past few years,'' Berko says. ''The product development is still the strongest in the industry and they're still committing money to advertising.''&nbsp;Valuable assets? Shares of Craig Corp. have been roaring higher since BusinessWeek reported Monday that some investors believe Craig is greatly undervalued. But at least one analyst takes exception to the article and recommends selling the Los Angeles-based real-estate and supermarket company. Craig shares, up 2 3/8 Monday, rose another 2 1/8 to $ 20 5/8 Tuesday - a 28% gain in two days.BusinessWeek, citing unnamed money managers, said Craig's 50% stake in Stater Bros., a private California supermarket chain, and stakes in financial services company Citadel Holding and real-estate manager Reading Co. make Craig's assets worth about $ 30 a share. But H.D. Brous &amp; Co. analyst Howard Rosencrans, one of the few analysts to follow the company, says the stock is fully valued at $ 15. He urges his clients to sell. He says 1991 sales slowed at Stater Bros. He says defense cuts and the poor real-estate market is hurting Craig's other interests.",0.0835858585859,0.489141414141,402 words,GoodNikeearnings look like a shoo-in,"February 3, 1991, Sunday, Final Edition",88 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"A few minutes after his team had easily dispatched Virginia Tech in December of 1989, John Thompson walked into an interview room at Capital Centre for his postgame comments. As he sat down, he heard a security guard out in the hallway carrying on a conversation.&quot;Bill, Bill,&quot; Thompson said, turning angrily toward the school's sports information director, Bill Shapland. And then he began to shout, &quot;I need someone to tell those people to shut up out there. Right now, tell them to shut up.&quot;A moment later, Thompson turned back toward the assembled press corps and calmly dissected the basketball game, laughing and joking about an easy win, the play of his new point guard, David Edwards, and how impressed he'd been by Virginia Tech's Bimbo Coles, one of his former Olympians, whom he now praised as &quot;the best guard in America.&quot;&nbsp;The sudden flash of fury, followed so quickly by this placid, good-humored dissertation, seemed so odd, and somewhat unnerving to anyone who saw it. Yet his friends will tell you that was typical of the John Thompson they have come to know. Many of those same people will also admit they don't really know him at all. They have an idea, a theory, an opinion, on what makes the man, what drives the man, but that's all. He's a very simple guy, says one friend. He's a very complex person, says another. Just when you think he's taking the money and running to the Denver Nuggets, he decides to stay at Georgetown.It has been that way all of his life, and John Thompson can also tell you what he is not.&quot;I am not Saint John,&quot; he once said. &quot;I do not go to confession seven days a week. I am not a father figure to my players. They all have parents, mothers and fathers, and I think you insult those people when you call me a father image to their sons. It is not my intention to be a crusader for this cause or that cause. I don't want to be a social worker. Let's take this education thing. They all say, 'Thompson is wonderful because he stresses education, education, education.' Well, they hired me to coach basketball. If I say I want my kids to get an education, it's perceived as an extraordinary thing, that I'm a martyr or something. Why should that be?&quot;Usually, there is a good guy or a bad guy. I'm not interested in being the bad guy. Who is? But I don't know if I'm the good guy either. I make mistakes. I get angry. Sometimes I work the kids too hard. I'm like any other coach -- I'd love to have them concentrate on basketball. I have people on my staff who help me control those feelings. I need that check. I am not trying to be anything other than what I am, and I'm really not certain what that is.&quot;I'm not exactly certain what that is either, but I've got a few opinions on some of the fundamental questions people have been asking me about John Thompson ever since I first met the man 20 years ago.Is John Thompson a racist?I do not believe he is.Many are convinced otherwise. They insist he fields a mostly black team because he has an innate distrust of whites going all the way back to his childhood. And yet the record indicates otherwise. If the measure of a man is taken by the company he keeps, consider the following: His two most trusted aides over the last 18 years have been whites -- Mary Fenlon and Bill Stein. His chief recruiter, Craig Esherick, is white. So are Georgetown's longtime head trainer, Lorry Michel; the team physician since 1974, Carl MacCartee; the radio play-by-play announcer from day one, Rich Chvotkin, and the longtime sports information director, Bill Shapland. His most loyal supporters on campus for most of his tenure -- Father Timothy Healy, the former school president; Frank Rienzo, the athletic director; and Charles Deacon, the director of admissions -- are white. Two of his closest advisers over the years -- Dave Gavitt and Red Auerbach -- are white. So are his agents -- Donald Dell and David Falk -- not to mention his good friend Dan Rather, a loyal supporter of the program who calls more than occasionally. And when Thompson was leaning toward accepting the Denver job, it was Esherick he was pushing as his replacement, not Mike Riley, a black assistant.He obviously cares very deeply about issues affecting minorities. His stands on Propositions 48 and 42 are testament to that. He also tells his players there is one virtually certain way to overcome racism and escape the inner city: money. But John Thompson a racist? Emphatically no.If he's not a racist, why are white players so few and far between on his teams?The same question could also be asked of most of America's major college basketball coaches. Heading into the 1990s, more than 70 percent of the players on major college basketball teams are black, and the percentage is growing each year. The talent pool of white players physically gifted enough to play at the highest level of the sport is rather thin, and competition for the best players is fierce.In Thompson's defense, many white players would prefer to go elsewhere and not play for a demanding black coach, though it must also be said that he has not gone out of his way to recruit white athletes. Danny Ferry (Duke all-America two years ago) grew up in his own backyard, but Thompson never made an attempt to talk to him. He should have. Still, in recent years Thompson hasn't been doing much recruiting anyway, of white or black players. He hates the process, finds it demeaning. But he does not dislike white ball players.Is he a bully?At times he can be. He is an intimidating presence, a 6-foot-10, 270-pound bundle of potentially belligerent rage and retribution who has also learned over the years how to use his size and his bellowing baritone voice to his full advantage. It is not a pretty sight.In his own Big East Conference, Thompson has feuded with fellow coaches Jim Boeheim (Syracuse), Rick Pitino (formerly of Providence) and Paul Evans (Pittsburgh), though all three insist they no longer have a problem with the head Hoya. His disdain for Brent Musburger has been well documented. He also tried to bully another old colleague, Bill Raftery of CBS, when the former Seton Hall coach criticized his team's roughhouse style during a game against Pittsburgh in 1987 that degenerated into a brawl.Can John Thompson coach?No question here. His record speaks for itself -- 423 wins going into this season, a national championship, three Final Four appearances, four Big East Conference regular season titles, 14 times in the NCAA tournament, including 12 straight, 16 consecutive postseason appearances.His teams are disciplined, incredibly conditioned and thoroughly relentless, particularly on defense, where Thompson truly excels. The Hoyas have never been a sophisticated offensive team, and only when Patrick Ewing left the program and turned professional did he become a major scoring force. The same may also hold true for the team's current star, Alonzo Mourning, who has struggled adjusting to Thompson's offense.Thompson was not a great offensive player, and he is not a gifted offensive coach. But he does get results. Mitch Kupchak, the assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Lakers, also points out that very few of the 18 players drafted by the NBA from Thompson's teams have been stars in the professional ranks. Ewing is an all-star for the New York Knicks. Sleepy Floyd is a solid pro for Houston. But many of Thompson's best players -- Craig Shelton, John Duren, Bill Martin, David Wingate, Reggie Williams, Charles Smith -- have struggled in the NBA. Kupchak believes it's a testament to Thompson's ability that he can keep his teams at the highest levels of the game without the best athletes.Thompson's pursuit of the dollar has been almost as intense as his quest for a national championship. Money makes men free, Thompson is fond of saying, and it also allows him to have the kind of control he covets -- complete, absolute authority to do it his way, just as Auerbach and Bill Russell taught him so many years ago.Thompson believes money is the root of all power. &quot;I think more change has come about because of economics, because people totally disregard color barriers if you have economic value,&quot; he has said.In America in 1990, it's hard to argue that philosophy with a man who pulled himself all the way up from poverty.Some rivals believe Thompson has a competitive advantage recruiting players because of his ties toNikeand a $ 200,000 a year endorsement contract with the company. Mourning is the primary case in point. Thompson first met him on campus at aNike-sponsored tournament. Mourning's high school team woreNikeproducts. He attended aNike-sponsored summer camp, where his high school coach was a paid counselor there for two years. The summer league Mourning played in used sneakers supplied byNike, and specifically by Sonny Vaccaro, theNikeexecutive who is also a good friend of Thompson's. Thompson, Vaccaro and Mourning have all previously denied that Thompson's business connection withNikeand friendship with Vaccaro had anything to do with Mourning going to Georgetown.But there is growing concern among college athletic officials -- and even among coaches themselves -- that shoe companies are influencing the recruiting process by offering free shoes, equipment and stipends to high school coaches, who then may steer top prospects toward college coaches affiliated with those very same shoe companies. Because of such concerns, the NCAA says it will soon be looking into the issue.There are those who believe that college coaches under contracts to shoe companies should give back part of their earnings to their schools, perhaps even sharing endorsement money (in the form of a stipend) with their players who wear the shoes. Dean Smith has been an advocate of sharing the wealth, but that is now prohibited by the NCAA.Thompson sees nothing wrong with the big money paid to coaches by the shoe companies, and finds it ironic that he's being criticized at a time when so few high-profile black athletes or coaches receive endorsement deals. He also says shoe contracts allow many smaller schools to keep high-profile coaches from moving to bigger institutions.&quot;Would P. J. Carlesimo have stayed at Seton Hall [without his shoe money]?&quot; Thompson said in a previous interview. &quot;No. Would John Thompson have stayed at Georgetown? No. Would Rollie Massimino have stayed at Villanova? No. In a competitive marketplace, the big state schools, particularly in the West, could have recruited the coaches with their big-time boosters.&quot;Is John Thompson loyal to his former players and coaches?Some of Thompson's players, particularly from his pre-Ewing days, are extremely bitter and haven't spoken to him in years. His first three big-name signings from his own high school team -- Greg Brooks, Jonathan Smith and Merlin Wilson -- want nothing to do with the program, mostly because they believe Thompson lost interest in them once they stopped playing and left school. And yet their teammate Aaron Long, a seldom-used reserve, to this day remains a close Thompson confidant and speaks in glowing terms of his old coach.Thompson's relationship with his stars is somewhat intriguing -- and inconsistent -- as well. Patrick Ewing is still very much a presence in the program. Thompson speaks with him often, uses him to help recruit and gives him carte blanche to use Georgetown's facilities in the offseason.But Sleepy Floyd, Thompson's first all-American, says he's lost touch with his old coach, for no particular reason other than the fact that he plays ball in Houston and was never that close to him to begin with. Similarly, Reggie Williams, Thompson's last all-American, hasn't had any contact with the program virtually since the day he graduated.Thompson can hardly be expected to have close relationships with every athlete who came through the program, but several former players (especially Craig Shelton) have complained that Thompson, in addition to being inaccessible, has done virtually nothing to show his appreciation for their past contributions. Many schools, for example, bring back players from the past for special halftime or pregame ceremonies. Not Georgetown. &quot;It's like we were never there,&quot; said one former player. &quot;They don't even invite me to the team banquet, and I live 10 minutes from campus.&quot;Thompson's relationship with many of his old friends has also been inconsistent. While people like Fenlon, Stein, Auerbach and Gavitt have been constants in his life for years, many others who played significant roles in his success have fallen by the wayside. Jim Wiggins, the barber who was Thompson's closest confidant in the early years, is now a bitter enemy. Ron Watts, his pal from the Celtic days and the man he named his son after, hardly ever talks to Thompson. Bob Dwyer, his old high school coach, desperately wants to make peace with Thompson, but Thompson won't even return his telephone calls.Has Georgetown sold out to big-time college sports?Of course it has, just as any school that maintains a high-profile, nationally ranked athletic program sells out, despite all the pious pronouncements to the contrary. As Murray Sperber wrote in College Sports Inc.: &quot;Athletes are the only group of students recruited for entertainment -- not academic -- purposes, and they are the only students who go through school on grants based not on educational aptitude, but on their talent and potential as commercial entertainers. If colleges searched for and gave scholarships to up-and-coming rock stars so that they could entertain the university community and earn money for their schools through concerts and tours, educational authorities and the public would call this 'a perversion of academic values.' &quot;Georgetown's decision to allow marginal students into its program is a sellout as well. But what can we say about other sports at top &quot;sports colleges&quot; in America? Clearly Michael Graham had no business at Georgetown. Neither did John Turner. Professors who have these and other students in their classes can only shrug their shoulders. One psychology professor told me that he learned a long time ago it would be wise to simply accept the fact that some athletes did not belong in his class, and do the best he could to get them through. It's the price you pay for a Top 20 basketball team. And the evidence suggests that Thompson's record is better -- far better -- than the records of most other coaches in big-time college sports in this regard.But there is no question that Thompson has been a godsend for Georgetown. His basketball program funds most of the school's athletic programs, and helps balance the department's budget. A good portion of the money earned from NCAA appearances goes into the school's scholarship fund and some also is used to improve athletic facilities. With NCAA Final Four teams scheduled to earn $ 3 million in 1991, that contribution to university coffers has the potential to be staggering.More important, his teams' constant success over the years has increased the school's national visibility and fueled intense interest in the university, particularly among minority applicants. Last year alone, the school had more than 1,000 applications from black students around the country. When Thompson took over the program, there were fewer than 100 black applicants a year. Similarly, the number of total applicants also has risen dramatically over the years, and school officials say the basketball team's rise to prominence in the national polls has played a significant role.A successful athletic team also helps draw a college community together. It becomes a rallying point for students, faculty and far-flung alumni, particularly when the team does well. Father Timothy Healy, the school's former president, spoke frequently about the &quot;great pride and joy&quot; the basketball team provided the Georgetown community -- how successful teams were also part of the educational process, giving students an outlet to vent their emotions and blow off steam after a tough day in the classroom and the library.John Thompson works long, hard hours and expects the same from everyone around him. Accept it or leave. That's how he runs his life, that's how he runs his program. He makes no promises to his players. He sets down the rules and expects them to be followed. Coats and ties on the road. Freshmen carry the basketballs. You will sign John's (class attendance) book or face the consequences. Miss a class, don't bother to practice. Miss a bunch of classes, don't bother to come back at all.The secrecy, the security, the paranoia are also part of the package. So are Thompson's pursuit of the dollar, his silly little fusses and feuds with so many people, his almost fiendish fetish for the privacy of his family and his team.And yet the system works for Georgetown, and especially for John Thompson. He wins basketball games, and does it within the rules. He makes a ton of money for his school, and has given Georgetown more exposure than anyone thought possible when he was first hired in 1972. Almost all of his players graduate and go on to productive lives.But John Thompson's own life has been the greatest success story of them all: He began his life as a poor youngster from the inner city who rose above poverty and prejudice to reach the very top of his highly visible profession, earning a small fortune along the way and becoming a widely respected spokesman for his school, his sport, and his people, just as Anna Thompson always told him he could.",0.131856952571,0.449777102222,2944 words,GoodNikeearnings look like a shoo-in,"June 29, 1991, Saturday, SATURDAY SECOND EDITION",89 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

The only thing that can stop the dream is you. Come on. Get into a pair.Just do it. Pump it. Air it.By now, most of us have felt the pull of these ads. They're among hundreds of pitches for running shoes. And they're the work of some of the best creative minds. (The shivering pupae come courtesy of Canada's master director, David Cronenberg, and the newNikeAir 180). That kind of image-making talent is drawn by success. And there are few products in our time that rival the runaway success of the shoes we used to call &quot;runners&quot;.They're &quot;sports shoes&quot; now, or &quot;athletic shoes&quot;. They're flashy, high-tech, stupendously colorful, and sheer energy on your feet. They come in hundreds of styles and we buy millions of pairs.In Canada this year that will add up to $1 billion. The Americans have passed $10 billion. And experts will tell you that 80 per cent of them are sold to people who do no regular exercise at all. It isn't just jocks, it's an entire culture that's buying into the image (or images) of the athletic shoe.And the intense, competitive, and volatile sports shoe industry is pulling out all the marketing stops. Saying it with sneakers has become part of the way our culture expresses itself.

Okay, just for you, a K Swiss Gstaad?Sport shoe language is physical, aggressive, exciting. And the sales pitch comes from some very big stars. From Michael Jordan, the limping Bo Jackson, Andre Agassi, John McEnroe (Nike). There's sweet Stefan Edberg, or cool Yvan Lendl (adidas). For Reebok there's Isiah Thomas or Michael Chang. And how about this lineup for L.A. Gear: Joe &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; Montana, Paula &quot;Everybody's Sweetheart&quot; Abdul. (Soon to be joined by those noted jocks, Heather Locklear and Priscilla Presley. Gear's contract with Michael Jackson is being disputed).What happened? How did the dowdy home of the Odor Eater and the droopy gym sock become show business? How did it become the gleaming billion dollar marvel we see today? How did every third shoe sold become a sports shoe?The answer is partly the product itself. It has come a long, long way. But it has also been carried forward by some of the immense social forces of our time, forces that began to gather just after World War II.The first rubber-soled canvas shoe actually goes way back to 1868. And on a royal visit in 1919, the then-beloved Prince of Wales had actually started a brief craze for a sports shoe with &quot;style&quot; when he wore his white canvas plimsolls to play tennis.But the real story begins with the post-war kids in the '50's. They were vast in number, liked having things of their own, and they started to develop a special attachment to what Canadian kids called &quot;running shoes.&quot; (&quot;Sneakers&quot; was the Americanism.)Compared to the high-tech wonders of today, they were a primitive piece of goods - and pretty plain. Just black high cuts at first, though white runners, colors, and low cuts followed as the '60s dawned.And when you gave them a pounding, they looked it. The canvas frayed, your big toe wore through, the rubber pieces came unglued and ripped off, they didn't smell very nice and suddenly the fun . . . wasn't there anymore. What was formerly funky was now just a beaten looking thing. And your mother would definitely not let you wear them to school.Still, they could be pretty cool when they were broken in just right. And those Keds and P.F. Flyers looked great with jeans.In the footwear market, things started to change. Sneakers went from 5 per cent of the market in 1950, to 10 per cent in 1957, to 20 in 1962.The leather shoemakers tried to fight back. They planted stories in the teen magazines saying a fad was ending (&quot;TEENS SHED SNEAKERS&quot;). They found podiatrists who claimed, &quot;SNEAKERS BAD FOR GROWING FEET&quot;.It didn't work. Sports shoes had had arch and heel supports since the '30s. That rubber sole would come a long way later, but it was basically fine. The kids' feet were all right and they wore their sneakers more and more.What they wore were a few classic styles - deck shoe, basketball high top, all-purpose runner.But elsewhere in the world were forces that would change things. New attention was being paid to engineering and design in both Japan (Tiger shoes) and Germany (Puma, adidas).The German shoes were actually the creations of rival brothers, Rudi (Puma) and Adi (adidas) Dassler who had quarrelled, broken up a 23-year-old family business, and vowed never to speak again. They competed in every way, including in a field Rudi pioneered - paying athletes for wearing your brand of shoe.At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, shoe reps ran wild. Athletes reaped an instant cash harvest, and all over the world a recognition dawned - with trademark logos, sports shoes had become prime advertising space.Soon we were treated to the spectacle of gold medalists holding their sneakers aloft - not their national flag. An anonymous product was starting to hit the big time.Suddenly, for the post-war kids, there was a whole range of new international brands to buy. And they were better, stronger shoes.The kids became adults, but they decided sneakers were one of the things they wouldn't let go. Part of it was staying young, and part of it was defying mom. It was a countercultural statement to wear the &quot;unacceptable&quot; shoe anywhere.Special attention had to be paid to the newest craze of the baby boom age - jogging.It was a way to hold on to your youth. Suddenly the streets were filled with people in flight - racing from the spectre of middle age. And they were hurting themselves doing it - until gradually better arch and heel support, new style toe boxes, fast-gripping soles, and shock absorbing mid-soles, made running on the merciless pavement possible.America staged a comeback in sneaker sales. It was lead by former University of Oregon track coach, Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, a former Oregon middle distance runner turned MBA.After both worked with the Tiger company of Japan on making and selling better sports shoes, Bowerman made his now famous breakthrough. Pouring rubber into his waffle iron at home, he discovered the lightweight/strong grip &quot;waffle sole&quot; that took the running world by storm.They set up shop in Beaverton, Ore. and named their company after the Greek goddess of victory -Nike.By the end of the '70s,Nikewas America's leading brand. But all the brands seemed to be selling more and more pairs of athletic shoes.In 1980, a transit strike in New York sent thousands of people out in the street, and they began to wear sneakers to walk to work. It was an inspired choice.Women especially loved them. Wearing sneakers with your business suit was a sign you had moxie, that you'd no longer put up with the punishment of high heels for the sake of fashion or male approval. Women everywhere took note.What also converted millions of women to sports shoes was a new sport that seemed just right for them. Aerobics looked disco-driven and faddish to begin with, but it really was an inspired mix of calisthenics and dance.And it was a tough workout that required a special kind of shoe. A British company took a gamble and designed and produced one that aerobicizers loved. The shoe made a household word out of Reebok.The list of the converted was lengthening all the time. Among the baby boomers were those who were seriously into exercising, and those who wanted to practice what Tom Wolfe called &quot;young fit and firm chic.&quot;Bringing up the rear were the rest, like me, who hadn't realized what they were missing. When I finally got around to trying a new, scientifically designed shoe - lightweight, with reinforced everything and a multi-layered sole - I was stunned. Nothing had ever felt so good on my feet.So much for the old kids. In the '80s it was really the new kids who put the sports shoe industry into the billion dollar stratosphere. Far from the yupscale world of the thirtysomethings, sneakers became a passion for teenagers on the paved-over, graffiti-filled playgrounds of the American inner city.They were part of the dress uniform of cool, must haves for young urban warrior. In Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, the movie's tone of high-tension about to explode is quickly created when a ghetto dweller's new sneakers are scuffed by a passerby.In TV commercials, it was emulation of the great new basketball stars, flying wonders like Julius Erving, &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, and Michael &quot;Air&quot; Jordan - men the sports shoe companies were making into megastars.Then sneakers became part of new street music - rap. A style had been set that would reach teenagers everywhere.New padded high tops, colored leather uppers, neon stripes and accents, wave after wave of new brands, and millions of dollars in marketing - it was making the ever-hip sports shoe all but irresistible.But it wasn't all good news. The shoes broke the hundred dollar barrier and kept climbing.For all the joy they brought to teenagers who could manage to afford a pair, there was the pain for those who couldn't buy in. At times it turned ugly. &quot;Boy Stabbed For Sneakers&quot; sounds like an urban myth. Police officers in a lot of cities, including Toronto, know it's not.Where does it end? Where does the craving for sports shoes stop?Some people think it won't. Partly, it's because there are now so many brands to choose from, and their ever-new technologically dazzling models are marketed so well. And partly, it's because they really do deliver.&quot;The baby boom generation has had it with traditional leather shoes,&quot; says podiatrist and author ( The Foot Book) Dr. Glen Copeland.The future may be compromise. The halls and boardrooms where sneakers still fear to tread are now seeing the walking shoe - a traditional leather upper on an athletic style sole.There's been magic born out of the old love affair between kids and their running shoes.

johnson, and michael &quot;air&quot; jordan - men the sports shoe companies were making into megastars.then sneakers became part of new street music - rap. a style had been set that would reach teenagers everywhere.new padded high tops, colored leather uppers, neon stripes and accents, wave after wave of new brands, and millions of dollars in marketing - it was making the ever-hip sports shoe all but irresistible.but it wasn't all good news. the shoes broke the hundred dollar barrier and kept climbing.for all the joy they brought to teenagers who could manage to afford a pair, there was the pain for those who couldn't buy in. at times it turned ugly. &quot;boy stabbed for sneakers&quot; sounds like an urban myth. police officers in a lot of cities, including toronto, know it's not.where does it end? where does the craving for sports shoes stop?some people think it won't. partly, it's because there are now so many brands to choose from, and their ever-new technologically dazzling models are marketed so well. and partly, it's because they really do deliver.&quot;the baby boom generation has had it with traditional leather shoes,&quot; says podiatrist and author ( the foot book) dr. glen copeland.the future may be compromise. the halls and boardrooms where sneakers still fear to tread are now seeing the walking shoe - a traditional leather upper on an athletic style sole.there's been magic born out of the old love affair between kids and their running shoes. it's become the golden age of the rubber sole.* peter feniak, a toronto writer and broadcaster, is former host of lifetime on the ctv network and that's life on global tv.",GoodNikeearnings look like a shoo-in,"September 1, 1991, Sunday, SUNDAY SECOND EDITION",91 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOSTON - A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers. He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of &quot;sky surfing.&quot;It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing. The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short. Play Hard.&quot;&nbsp;That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the Number 2 spot and overtake its rival,Nike.The sky surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that made its debut on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York. The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology. The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that for a variety of reasons fell short ofNike'subiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon. As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on. Reebok also last year was caught in a controversy over a campaign that depicted &quot;bunjee jumping,&quot; an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges or other high objects.At the same time, Reebok has been labelled a &quot;revolving door&quot; client by ad agencies. The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bunjee jumping ad. Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last long, either, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day. Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past. But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.&quot;Reebok has been like a teenager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign. &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things. Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;Analysts and advertising executives say it will be months before there are clear signs whether the campaign will create a new high-water mark for athletic shoe ads. But most reacted positively to Reebok's approach.&quot;I've seen the line and I like it. In the context of sports and of trying to have the maximum performance, I think it works,&quot; said Joe Grimaldi, chief operating officer of Mullen Advertising Inc. of Wenham, Mass.Several wondered privately whether Reebok's new theme is more attuned to the go-go 1980s than the presumably more laid-back '90s. But the consensus was that it would appeal to the active and would-be athletes Reebok is trying to reach, especially if the company doesn't put the campaign on the shelf too soon.&quot;I wouldn't be too literal about the line. It could do for them what 'Just Do It' does forNike.It's a call to action, an invitation to get out there and play some sports,&quot; said Ron Lawner, chairman and creative director at the Lawner Reingold Britton agency in Boston.&quot;It seems they are introducing a campaign idea that they are going to stay with, and I think that's even more important than the campaign itself,&quot; said Steve Encarnacao, Reebok's chief marketing officer from 1985-87 and now chief executive of Stonemark Inc., which produces Carter's children shoes.Encarnacao suggested the new campaign harks back to an early, successful effort by Rebok, titled &quot;...

"THE sporting-goods industry did its best last week to ignore the recession. The 85,000 sports aficionados who gathered here for the industry's largest annual trade exhibit -- the Super Show -- whet their appetites on a menu of new technology sauteed in marketing hype.With more than 1.6 million square feet of floor space and 6,000 booths at four sites in the downtown area, mostly at the Georgia World Congress Center, manufacturers unveiled exercise machines that talk back, tennis racquets that sound heavy but feel light, shoes that spring off their heels, bicycles that jump curbs and clothes that breathe.&nbsp;Swarms of buyers for stores perused the show in search of items that would sell in a flat retail market. Although the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, which stages the show, projected a 6 percent growth in the industry's wholesale volume, from $30.8 billion in 1990 to $32.7 billion in 1991, the number fell short of the double-digit expansion the industry had come to expect.But insiders were buoyed by the recession-resistant nature of the industry. &quot;Sports have become a solid part of the modern-life style, and, therefore, sporting-goods sales are less negatively affected in recessionary times,&quot; said John D. Riddle, association president.&nbsp;An OverviewLured by dazzling product displays, visitors to the show faced a marketing barrage. From Joe Montana to Greg Norman, sports celebritries appeared as if they were hors d'oeuvres in a dinner of corporate steaks.Nike,the athletic-footwear manufacturer, spent $4 million on its booth. The 61,000-square-foot area featuredNike'snewest shoes under robotic lights on center stage. Reebok, dominated a $1 million space not far down the concourse where aerobic dance skits, loud rock music and intermittent celebrity autograph signings set a frenetic pace.Lower-profile exhibitors staffed booths strung out with wares like an exotic marketplace. Despite the enticements, most dealers seemed cautious.&quot;We're going to watch our spending,&quot; said Brad Henry, a buyer for Valley Sports of Fresno, Calif. &quot;We're not going to tie up our dollars far in advance.&quot;The mood translated into a search for trends: something, anything to make the public buy, buy, buy. Here are a few trends to watch for in your sport and equipment of choice.&nbsp;TennisWidebody racquets are still the industry favorites. But the new watchwords of the 46 racquet manufacturers at the show are &quot;lighter&quot; and &quot;more flexible.&quot; First introduced by Wilson Sporting Goods in 1987, the widebody racquet was made to be stiff and powerful. Today's versions are designed to put feel back in the racquet and dampen shock. Racquets are lighter than ever: the 10-ounce barrier has been broken.&quot;They are taking the fat out,&quot; said Tracy Leonard, equipment adviser for Tennis magazine.And finding ingenious ways to do it, too. Head's Genesis racquet, for instance, is thinner in the cross sections. The Hammer, Wilson's newest high-end widebody, has taken about two ounces out of the handle, but kept the same weight in the head.Prince introduced the Vortex widebody racquet at the show, its light weight achieved with materials adopted from the aerospace industry: viscoelastic polymer, a thermoplastic material, and continuous strands of carbon fiber. The strings are staggered along the frame, an innovation designed to absorb more impact from the ball.Dunlop attacked the widebody's shock-absorption problem in a different way. With its new Revelation racquet, introduced last month and on display at the show, the company added vibration-dampening rods to the handle.High-end racquets are closing in on $300. But the new technology is filtering down to mid-priced racquets, too.&nbsp;FootwearThe leading footwear manufacturers set the tone of the show with fancy video displays and Hollywood floor shows. But even more impressive was their sheer numbers: more than 160 exhibitors of everything from basketball shoes to sandals were on hand.Other than L.A. Gear, which has produced the Catapult, a basketball shoe with a heel spring, most innovations are directed at weight savings.&quot;The challenge is in finding a balance between light, and making a shoe with cushioning, stability and support,&quot; said Bill Dragon, president of Avia.New materials, like thermoplastics, carbon fiber and foams, are replacing standard materials.Nikehas taken the heel counter out of its new Haurache running shoe and replaced it with a molded rubber heel strap.And making it clear that they intend to follow their customers from the basketball and tennis courts to the trails of the backwoods, the leading manufacturers showed new lines of shoes and clothing for hiking, camping and mountain biking.&quot;People who were exposed to running in the 1980's while they were single are looking for activities they can do with their families in the 1990's,&quot; said Tom Clarke, director of marketing forNike.&nbsp;FitnessWeight machines, popular in the 1970's, are making a comeback for the home, said Richard Miller, a buyer for The Gym Source, a New York City equipment distributor. &quot;Home use is the future,&quot; Miller said.Companies like Pacific Fitness are making compact home-gym units that allow for 100 different exercises at a price of $1,600 to $2,400.CSA Inc., a fitness-products manufacturer from South Easton, Mass., introduced 23 new exercise machines at the show, including several versions of computerized talking machines that it began marketing last year. The units are designed to verbally coach users, and to store previous workouts so they can be recalled for comparison to a new routine.Bike machines still appear to be more popular than treadmills and stairsteppers.Traditional companies are diversifying. Life Fitness, the company that spearheaded the stationary-bike movement, has designed a new stair machine this year, Lifestep 5500, available this summer for $1,295.&nbsp;BicyclingAlthough bicycling is a fast-growing sport with a propensity for dramatic innovation, only 19 bicycle manufacturers showed up in Atlanta. A recent study by Bicycling magazine counted 32 million cyclists in the United States. In recognition of this popularity, the Super Show opened its doors for a cycle show for the first time. Although few of the leading manufacturers attended, signs of trends surfaced, most noticeably in the cross bike.As a hybrid of road and mountain bikes, the cross bike has thinner tires than a mountain bike. It has a more central shifting system, and a sloping top tube. &quot;People are finding that the mountain bike is too much bike,&quot; said Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling. &quot;The cross bike is a bike that people can ride for commuting or in-town use.&quot;&nbsp;ApparelNeon is out and deeper, richer tones and earth colors are in, reflecting a pervasive embrace of the outdoors. Moreover, companies like Du Pont, Hind andNike,who make their own fabrics, are finding that function is blurring with fashion.&quot;This crossover isn't necessarily a permanent thing because of the fickleness of ready-to-wear,&quot; said Jennifer Lisle, fabrics editor at Sport Style, a biweekly sports publication.Function, however, still dominates. Lynn Hill, the top United States women's rock climber, and Katarina Witt, the German Olympic skater, attended the Super Show on behalf of Du Pont and Hind. Hill scaled artificial walls to demonstrate how athletic tights &quot;allow you to move with your sport.&quot;",0.159484417243,0.4331898625,1251 words,"L.A.

"Nikehas employed an all- star roster of male athletes, including Bo Jackson and Michael Jordan, to lure men to its lines of athletic footwear. But what about women, who accounted for roughly 42 percent of all athletic shoes purchased in 1990?&quot;We feel our advertising has to be different for women,&quot; said Lisa DeNeffe, aNikespokeswoman. &quot;Women look up to other women, but they don't really have specific role models as much as men do. So we took a different approach.&quot;&nbsp;That approach is illustrated in an eight-page insert thatNikeand its advertising agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, began placing in women's magazines earlier this month. Instead of sports stars, the ad relies on simple sentences in large black type that chronicle the stages in a woman's life from childhood to adulthood.&quot;You wanted to be a veterinarian,&quot; the ad states in a section devoted to childhood. &quot;You wanted to be president.

"ALAN Davidson is the first player to argue about being selected as the Herald-SunNikeAir player-of-the-week.His performance when Melbourne Croatia fought back from a goal down to beat Wollongong Macedonia 2-1 at the weekend earned rave reviews from the media and he was the automatic choice for the weekly award.But the veteran Socceroo was reluctant to accept.&nbsp;&quot;I felt I worked hard, but the game was marred by a strong wind and didn't lend itself to outstanding performances,&quot; he said.&quot;It was my first outing in midfield, but it turned into a game for defences having to cope with long balls.

"SOUTH Melbourne is finding out that every one of its NSL games is a virtual Cup final.If it's not a local derby, it has been the pressure of bouncing back from a defeat or hitting back at criticism of its playing style. Even against the lower sides the expectations have been not only to win comfortably, but also to do it with flair.&nbsp;South's annual clashes against sister club Sydney Olympic have also been regarded as special and a means of proving which of the Greek backed clubs is more dominant in the competition.Sunday's clash between the two in Sydney has an added ingredient, according to South striker Kimon Taliadoros.&quot;Every game South Melbourne plays is a big game, but personally, I have been looking forward to this one for some time,&quot; Taliadoros said yesterday.&quot;They knocked us out of the finals last season and this is more of a revenge game for me. It was that way when we met them at home earlier this season, but I believe we still owe them.&quot; Taliadoros celebrated his return to the senior side after a seven-week absence by scoring two goals in the 7-3 win over Wollongong Mac last Sunday.His effort earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award for round 17.&quot;It is certainly the highest scoring game I've been involved in my senior career,&quot; he said.Taliadoros paid special credit to his striking partner Paul Trimboli for the goals.&quot;If you look into them, you'll find that Trimmers was involved in almost all the goals at some stage.He was an integral part of my two,&quot; he said.&quot;As is the case with most South Melbourne goals, they were the result of excellent teamwork. I was lucky to be the last man at the end of the line to apply the finishing touch.&quot; As the player of the week, Taliadoros receives a pair ofNikeAir runners valued at $280, as well as collecting votes towards the Golden Boot.The end of season winner of the award receives $2000 fromNike.Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot Award.Round 17.

"RUGGED defender Andrew Marth yesterday admitted he has not yet hit his best form despite the recent media clamor for his inclusion in the Socceroos.The switch by Marth to a double centre-back role has helped Melbourne Croatia challenge for the NSL championship and earned praise from national coach Eddie Thomson who said the defender was on the verge of a call-up.Thomson took note of how Marth and George Hannah blotted out Warren Spink last Sunday. Only days earlier Spink had troubled Czechoslovakia with his sharpness and confidence to take defenders on.&nbsp;Marth also took the free kick which led to the winning goal against Preston Makedonia.While Marth concedes that his form is improving, he believes he has played better in the NSL.&quot;My second season at Sunshine George Cross (in 1988) was my best season and I ended up being the club's player of the year,&quot; Marth said yesterday.&quot;I still think I haven't played as well since although this season is now shaping up to go close.&quot;Marth is now part of Melbourne Croatia's ambitious charge for the title.&quot;The change of coach (at Melbourne Croatia) has made a big difference. Ken Worden has a playing style similar to John Gardiner (Marth's coach at Sunshine) and I'm enjoying the freedom to play the ball out of the back (rather than kicking long balls),&quot; he said.The defender's performance earns him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.As the weekly winner, Marth collects a pair ofNikeAir runners.The overall winner receives $2000 in cash fromNike.Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot Award.Round 18.

"DAVID CLARKSON has countered rumors about his commitment to Sunshine George Cross by grabbing a share of the lead in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.Clarkson, man of the match in the past two rounds, earned the player of the week title for his display against Wollongong Mac.The three votes gives him 17 and equal leadership with St George keeper John Filan.&nbsp;&quot;I had gone for five weeks without picking up votes so it's nice to get some reward for playing well,&quot; Clarkson said yesterday.The midfielder returned to Melbourne yesterday after making a hurried dash across the Tasman to see his sick sister in Hobart.Clarkson was a committed supporter of previous Sunshine coach Ernie Merrick, who brought him to the club from Adelaide City.There were suggestions that Clarkson and teammate Craig Foster would walk out of the club after Merrick's dismissal but the player has killed off those rumors with his good form.&quot;I certainly didn't like the way Ernie was sacked but it's good to have Tony Vrzina around and it's very important for all the players to stick by the new coach,&quot; Clarkson said.Clarkson admitted that desperation had played a part in his recent good form.&quot;All of us are playing for our survival as well as the club's,&quot; he said.&quot;I certainly hope the club won't be relegated but either way we have to try and lift ourselves and play better.&quot;If the worst was to happen and the club was relegated, the players will be judged on their performances if they are to get another club.&quot; As the weekly winner, Clarkson receives a pair ofNikeAir runners valued at $280.

"IT HAS taken four years, but Heidelberg's Willie Herd has finally proved himself a quality player, justifying his reputation and excellent record in Scottish football.Herd was a prize signing by Melbourne Croatia in 1987 after accepting an invitation to play here despite being firmly established in the Scottish first division.The midfielder admitted yesterday the first two seasons turned into disasters after tearing a cartilage in the first game at his new club.&nbsp;&quot;I went to Brunswick Juventus the season after and had a groin problem which again required an operation and ruled me out for the full season,&quot; Herd said yesterday.&quot;It was frustrating and inexplicable, especially since, in 10 years of senior football in Scotland, I hardly ever missed a game, and by the time I came here I had played over 300 league games.&quot; Herd broke into senior soccer as a 17-year-old with East Fife. He was transferred for $40,000 to Falkirk when he was 20, and three years later joined Partick Thistle.&quot;(Melbourne Croatia's) Paul Donnelly had accepted an offer to play in Perth at the time and he got in touch. I felt I could do with a change and, on his advice, chose to join an NSL club.&quot; Herd felt he had made the wrong move after the two serious injuries.He scored his fifth for the season on Sunday against Melita Eagles to crown off a man-of-the-match performance which earned him the title of the player-of-the-week in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.As the weekly winner, Herd picks up a pair ofNikeAir runners valued at $280.

"THE ex-Socceroo tag doesn't sit kindly with Jeff Olver.The Heidelberg goalkeeper, the No.1 choice for Australia between 1986-89, is determined to regain the Socceroo crown from Robert Zabica and John Filan.Olver believes that at 30 he is still young in goalkeeping terms.&quot;If you look at the World Cup finals, you'll find the average age of the keepers is 35-36 with a few exceptions, like Zoff and Shilton, going well beyond that,&quot; Olver said.&nbsp;If form rather than age is the prerequisite for a spot in the national side, Olver has gone a long way towards staking a claim with his displays for Heidelberg.&quot;At the start of the season all the raves were about (St George keeper) Filan but I've looked for consistency rather than spectacular saves and I'm very pleased with my own form and the team's overall,&quot; he said.Olver was singled out for praise by coach Len McKendry after his keeping ensured a 1-0 win over Wollongong Mac and the two points made certain Heidelberg finishes clear of the relegation zone.&quot;That match was our cup final,&quot; he said. &quot;It was worth four points as a defeat would have dragged us back near the bottom two.&quot; Olver's performance against Wollongong Mac earns him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.He receives a pair ofNikeAir runners worth $280.

"&nbsp;Bo Jackson the athlete may be on the bench, but Bo Jackson the product spokesman may be busier than ever, said Richard Woods, a lawyer in Mobile, Ala., who is Jackson's agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In some ways this is a lucky break,&quot; Woods said Thursday. &quot;This will give him a lot of time to work on new and ongoing projects.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Kansas City Royals released him earlier this week, they said Jackson was not likely to be able to play baseball again, but his own doctor was much more optimistic. Jackson, who is also a pro football player with the Los Angeles Raiders, injured his left hip in an NFL playoff game in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many advertising executives say that if Jackson never plays sports again, his value as a product spokesman will surely be diminished.  But several said he still has more than enough name recognition and good will to have a fruitful career as an endorser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's famous for being Bo Jackson. He is a celebrity over and beyond his sports,&quot; said Brian J. Murphy, publisher of Sports Marketing Letter in Westport, Conn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not sitting still, said Woods, his agent. Within the next couple of weeks, he said, a deal will be announced that will establish Jackson as a &quot;leading public personality.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some speculation in the ad industry that Jackson will do a sports-oriented television program. Agency executives who have worked with him say he has acting talent and has become&nbsp;t&nbsp;t adept at self-deprecating humor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson recently signed a contract with Diversified Products, which will introduce a line of Bo Jackson exercise equipment later this year. Also, he can now devote more time to personal appearances and ads for Bo Med, a line of products for amateur athletes, like an analgesic rub and cold packs for sprains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent news conference, Jackson hobbled, on crutches, onto a stage to make a speech for Bo Med.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The injuries don't hurt,&quot; said Mike Vineyard, president of Cramer Products, which makes the line. &quot;It ties him closer to the products.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While marketing specialists maintain that Jackson still has a future in product endorsements, the potential payout is likely to be reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marty Blackman, of sports-marketing consultants Blackman and Raber Ltd. in New York, says Jackson has not played long enough to transcend sports celebrity and join the ranks of celebrity&nbsp; superstars like Joe Namath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was never on a World Series or Super Bowl team. He was a great athlete (but) I don't see at this stage where he could rank among the immortals,&quot; said Blackman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wood has said that Jackson earns &quot;much more&quot; money from product endorsements than from sports. His first three-yearNikedeal was said to be worth between $ 2-million and $ 3-million a year, and he recently signed a new three-year deal with the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson makes about $ 750,000 with the Raiders and had made about $ 1-million a year with the Royals, according to reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikespokeswoman Liz Borden said that the company &quot;backs Bo all the way and we believe that he will be back.&quot; But she added it's &quot;too soon to tell&quot; what would happen if his injuries force him to drop out of sports completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's hard to say, partly because we don't know what Bo will want to do. If Bo retires, then obviously we are faced with a very different situation,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile,Nikehas no ads of Jackson alone scheduled to run in the near term, according to Borden. A current ad showing Jackson with otherNikestars will continue to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike'sadvertising agency is now considering the contents of a summer ad campaign forNikecross-trainers. Jackson has appeared in it in the past three summers. &quot;It's not impossible&quot; that he'll be in it again this year, said Borden.&nbsp;Information from the Los Angeles Daily News was used in this report.&nbsp;",0.104001976285,0.480960693895,663 words,Nike'srevenue jumps,"January 24, 1991 Thursday",110 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

It has been casting Mr. Robinson in less&nbsp;ambiguous, heroic roles.A month ago, he appeared in a commercial playing piano with a 78-&nbsp;year-old concert pianist. Now Mr. Robinson is being plastered all over&nbsp;America (except Atlanta) on 1,200 public service billboards in 20&nbsp;markets. He's urging kids to stay in school.&nbsp;The billboard shows Mr. Robinson hoisting a stack of books. A&nbsp;basketball sits on top of them. Beside the photo is a huge headline that&nbsp;reads: &quot;Don't Be Stoopid. Stay In School.Nike.&quot;The ads are the lastest in the series ofNike&quot;Stay In School&quot;&nbsp;promotions that the company says are intended to &quot;reach the youth of&nbsp;America in a positive way about achievement and excellence as it relates&nbsp;to both education and athletics.&quot; Another ad, featuring another NBA star,&nbsp;Michael Jordan, and actor/director Spike Lee aired over the weekend.Nike, and other expensive athletic shoe makers, such as Reebok, have&nbsp;stepped up their public service activities in the last year as they've&nbsp;come under pressure by minority and public interest groups concerned&nbsp;about the popularity of the shoes among inner-city youths and resulting&nbsp;crimes.; Hold the adsThe 1960's are considered the Golden Age of Advertising. That's when&nbsp;Americans delighted in watching commercials such as Alka-Seltzer's hall-&nbsp;of-fame &quot;No matter what shape your stomach's in&quot; ads, which featured&nbsp;bouncy music and shots of every shape of human stomach imaginable - from&nbsp;a belly dancer, to a fat guy working a jackhammer, to a woman arguing&nbsp;with a chubby man on the street while poking him in the stomach with a&nbsp;pointed finger.In those golden days, less than half of America (43 percent) wanted&nbsp;television without commercials, according to a Columbia University study.&nbsp;Thirty years later, the university reports, almost two-thirds of America&nbsp;(67 percent) wants its TV, hold the ads.&quot;The novelty value of commercials a quarter-century ago kept this&nbsp;percentage (of people who want commercial-free TV) down,&quot; reports Video&nbsp;Storyboard Tests Commercial Break newsletter. &quot;But the novelty has all&nbsp;since evaporated and viewer complaints about commercial clutter have&nbsp;progressively grown. Older age groups, in particular, have a higher&nbsp;preference for television without commercials.&quot;Even more disturbing to advertisers, reports the newsletter, more&nbsp;than half of America (54 percent) is willing to pay &quot;a small amount&nbsp;yearly&quot; for TV without commercials, whereas in 1960 less than one in four&nbsp;(24 percent) said they'd pay for commercial-free TV.The goods news for advertisers: The percentage of people who say&nbsp;they frequently welcome a commercial break (36 percent) has not changed&nbsp;in 30 years; and, while more people want fewer, or no commercials, today&nbsp;more viewers (57 percent, up from 43 percent) believe &quot;some commercials&nbsp;are so good that they are more entertaining than the programs.&quot;; Back againTrue to the title of his book, &quot;Against Gravity,&quot; adman Ed McCabe&nbsp;has quit Miami advertisng agency Beber Silverstein &amp; Partners, and&nbsp;returned to New York, after only eight months on a quest to build the&nbsp;Miami agency into a powerhouse like his first shop, New York agency,&nbsp;Scali, McCabe, Sloves.

"Omni president/general manager Bob Dhue, citing competition from the&nbsp;Lakewood Amphitheater and the impending opening of the Georgia Dome in&nbsp;1992, has proposed a major renovation of the 18-year-old arena.In a presentation to the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority&nbsp;this week, Dhue outlined improvements and suggested bonds be approved to&nbsp;finance construction, since The Omni stands on public property. He&nbsp;emphasized The Omni would be responsible for the debt service and&nbsp;estimated the cost at between $ 3 million and $ 5 million.With recreation authority approval, construction could start as&nbsp;early as this summer and be complete well before the Georgia Dome opens.&nbsp;Among the proposals:- Convert interior concession stands to box suites, increasing the&nbsp;number from 12 to 32;- Knock out segments of the exterior walls and rebuild affected&nbsp;concession stands;- Double the restroom area;- Widen the concourse.Dhue said expansion of seating capacity from the current 16,600 was&nbsp;considered, but it was deemed unnecessary because the average attendance&nbsp;for 180 to 200 events per year is 11,000.&quot;To be competitive, we need to update,&quot; Dhue said. &quot;The Georgia Dome&nbsp;people have said they'd like to host college basketball games, SEC, ACC&nbsp;and NCAA tournaments, and as many as 12 rock concerts per year.

"PENTLAND, the British sports-goods firm, is set to negotiate a lucrative contractto arrange the to manufacture of Adidas sportswear products in the Far East following its move to buy a 20% stake in the German giant from Bernard Tapie.The deal could revitalise the fortunes of Adidas and enable it to catch up recover some of the ground that has been lost to its two American arch-rivals, Reebok andNike.Further, Paris financiers expect Pentland's Pounds 47m Adidas investment to lead to it taking control of Adidas next summer when Tapie faces his next financial crunch.&nbsp;In the meantime Pentland, famous for its role in which made its mark pushing Reebok to the top of the sports footwear league table, will focus its efforts on securing a lucrative sourcing contract in the Far East with Adidas.It hopes the contract will mirror the long-term deal with Reebok that played a key role in the footwear company's ''miracle turnround'' in the 1980s, when it caught up withNikeearning Pentland Pounds 6m profit last year.Adidas lost out in the cut-throat battle with Reebok andNikeas because it was slow to follow them into the Far East. Today 85% of the West German giant's shoes are made in the Far East but Pentland's expertise in this area should be able to cut costs further.For Pentland, whose brands include Pony and Speedo, the attraction is that net margins at Adidas are only one and a half percent 112% compared with 10% atNikeand Reebok. If they can sort out the Adidas sourcing, profits at Adidas could explode from the current Pounds 19m.Reebok's decision to terminate the sourcing contract with Pentland was a key factor that persuaded the British firm to sell part of its stake for Pounds 200m. Today with Reebok shares riding high at $32, Pentland may soon sell its remaining 13% stake, which is worth another Pounds 222m.The sourcing contract is the icing on the cake but Pentland does not hide its ambition to own Adidas.

"&nbsp;CONSUMERS, political activists and labor unions have adopted a new goal for anold strategy: They are boycotting companies with an eye toward the corporations' image, and not just their bottom line.  Because effectively mounted boycotts can derail marketing strategies and drain employee morale, as well as damage fragile corporate reputations, business executives now seem anxious to resolve disputes with boycotters.  But as companies capitulate, they may be encouraging even more groups to engage in this form of protest.  Corporate executives once tried to ignore consumer boycotts, but they are finding it a lot harder to do so now.  ''In the past,'' says Todd Putnam, the editor of the independent National Boycott News, ''it seemed like it would take years for a company to acknowledge or even recognize that it was being boycotted. Now it seems like you even say the word 'boycott' and people in the board room jump.'' There has been a lot of jumping in recent months. For example: In November, McDonald's Corp. gave in to the growing environmental sensitivities of its customers and announced that it would scrap its hard-to-recycle plastic-foam food containers.  Not long before that, when angry sports-bar owners threatened to boycott Miller beer and the products of several other leading sponsors of network television sports broadcasts, NBC and CBS shelved their plans to scramble satellite transmissions of professional football games.  Last April, three tuna companies, fighting an extended boycott, announced they would stop buying tuna caught in nets that also snared dolphins.&nbsp;These and other recent corporate capitulations show how willing business leaders have been to respond to consumer boycotts - especially when such protests threaten their corporation's public image and marketing strategies.  ''A company's reputation is a critical ingredient in any product it makes,'' says D. Edward I. Smyth, vice president for corporate affairs at the H.J. Heinz Co., the parent corporation of StarKist. StarKist was the first seafood company to announce that it would make its tuna ''dolphin-safe.'' A growing number of groups are using boycotts to promote social change.  Putnam estimates that more than 150 groups around the country are engaged in 200 to 250 national consumer boycotts. This is about twice the number of boycotts Putnam's newsletter was tracking a year ago.  ''I don't know if there have been this many boycotts ... since the 1920s and 1930s, when (union organizing efforts were still going on,'' Putnam says.  Boycotts have been used by both anti-abortion and abortion-rights organizations, sometimes against the same companies but for different reasons.  Animal rights activists used boycotts to persuade major cosmetic manufacturers to stop testing the safety of their products on laboratory animals. And a number of organizations have boycotted firms that do business in countries with dubious human rights records, including South Africa and El Salvador.  But most of the recent boycott boom can be attributed to environmental groups.  ''The reality is that, in ever greater numbers, consumers want environmentally safe products, packaging and processing,'' Smyth says.  ''The polls tell us that ... nearly 30 percent of consumers claim to have boycotted a company's products because of its environmental policies.'' Putnam attributes the growing number of boycotts in part to Americans' lack of faith in the legislative process. ''Boycotts are really a form of grass-roots democracy,'' he says. They offer ''a way to bypass the legislative process when you think that your elected representatives aren't going to represent you on this issue or that issue.'' But boycotts are not always successful. Sometimes companies fight back.  That's whatNikeInc. did last summer when it became the boycott target of Operation PUSH.  The Chicago-based group has successfully used consumer protests to pressure the Ford Motor Co. and other large corporations into investing more of their earnings in the black community. PUSH leaders sayNiketargets black consumers with advertising campaigns that feature prominent African-Americans, like film maker Spike Lee and football/baseball player Bo Jackson, but at the same time fails to provide enough executive opportunities for its black employees.  PUSH leaders also say the company has not invested enough of its revenue in black-owned businesses.  Unlike other PUSH targets,Nikeofficials fought back, accusing the boycott organizers of accepting contributions from Reebok International Ltd., a rival sportswear and athletic shoe manufacturer.Nikeofficials also suggested that the boycott was simply a publicity vehicle for the Rev. Tyrone Crider, who recently replaced Jesse Jackson as director of the 20-year-old group.Nikedid announce that it would adopt a two-year program to promote more minority employees into executive and senior management positions, including the company's first minority vice president and its first minority board member. But officials emphasized that ''minority'' did not necessarily mean ''black.'' Meanwhile, local civil rights leaders inNike'shometown of Portland, Ore., defended the company, saying it maintained a plant and outlet stores in predominantly black Portland neighborhoods while other companies were leaving the area.  The way in which a company responds to a boycott depends in large part on how sympathetic a company thinks its customers will be to the boycotters' message.  But boycotts are generally getting harder to ignore, a fact Putnam attributes to the increasing sophistication of the consumer campaigns.  ''Corporations spend millions of dollars every year trying to present a certain type of image,'' Putnam says, ''and if you can somehow damage that image, you are going to indirectly cost the company a lot of money.'' Boycotters who can do that will be taken seriously by a target corporation, says Jerry Johnson, the research director at Powell, Adams &amp; Rinehart, a Washington-based group that is part of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather public relations group.  ''There is an intrinsic desire on the part of a firm to be perceived as doing the right thing,'' Johnson says. ''It's good business.''",0.086254396645,0.382251758658,1040 words,NEWS BULLETINSNikeoutpaces Klein,"February 26, 1991, Tuesday",118 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Robert Lauterborn, James C. Knight professor of advertising at the School of Journalism, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill:I sorted them into winners and wasters - wasters because $ 800,000 for a 30- second commercial is a hell of a lot of money to waste. Anybody who came up with the same old commercials instead of bringing something new to the party was a waster.Winners? First of all, all of us because we needed a respite from the war and this really let us not think about it. And also ABC, because the game didn't get canceled and they ran 20 promos during the game that I counted. Among advertisers, Diet Pepsi. They had a huge presence, and if you're going to advertise on an extravaganza that's so overproduced like the Super Bowl, you have to have an overproduced extravaganza yourself. They did. They're winners especially against Coke, which was pathetically weak. Their ads were cheap, phony, patronizing and holier-than-thou. I think they did that because they knew they were going to get their butt kicked. Coke came off a sore loser. It was a big tactical mistake.&nbsp;Nikewas a winner. I can hardly wait to see their ad again. It was perfectNike:I knew from the first frame who it was. Very compelling. And they got three more free commercials from L.A. Gear and Reebok (which alluded toNike). Another loser was Bud Bowl. I mean, yawn.&nbsp;Irma Zandl, president of Xtreme, a youth marketing-consulting firm:The most interesting was Master Lock. It showed the product in an interesting way; you had classical music and the harsh reality of this lock. (Lock was shot, rammed with a truck and never broke.) Look how many ads we didn't even know what they were for until the very end. That's a big mistake. The creative drift is to not mention the product's name, to do everything in print. Everyone in the ad business sits around and watches commercials, but real people don't. It's when you go to the bathroom.The Diet Pepsi ads were good because they developed a theme. The Diet Coke ads were terrible. They're really trying to have their cake and eat it, too. It was a dishonest posture - ''We're not going to do this ad, however ...'' They just should've done the ad.The most irritating were the Bud Bowl ads. They've gone too far. Time to go on to something else.Advertising people have been looking at too many Infiniti ads. The fuzzy Americana ads - this new-age thing - makes all ads look alike. You can't tell if the Dockers ad was for jeans, or if it was another McDonald's ad. I thought the Audi ad was Infiniti on speed!L.A. Gear was the most effective shoe ad. It showed the shoe in a high- tech way and it didn't refer to the competition. If you've got 30 seconds, why advertise your competitor?&nbsp;Phil Lempert, editor of The Lempert Report, a food-marketing newsletter:Two major trends: warm and fuzzy, and music. The commercials were geared to baby boomers more than college kids or older Americans.The companies that did a special commercial for the Super Bowl made me feel special. That doesn't mean they were good, but they made me feel special that they went to that effort. If somebody's going to spend $ 800,000 for a commercial, spend a little more and somehow customize it.The high point was clearly the Ray Charles Diet Pepsi commercial. It was brilliantly done, and every time they added something else. By the end of the Super Bowl, I knew the slogan. I wanted to be Ray Charles. The low point was Coke. It was a cheap shot. They told us: ''We aren't going to do (the promotion), but here it is.''TheNikead was beautiful. It made believe that they were serious, that the products were good. But by the end of the game, how many people remember that it wasNike,since they've seen four other sneaker (ads) after that? The Reebok Pump came across better.

"Questions surroundingNikeInc.'s future earnings let some air out of its stock Thursday. The maker of Air Jordan and other pricey athletic shoes dropped 4 1/4 to $ 46 5/8 after two analysts scaled back their quarterly and yearly earnings estimates for the company.Shearson Lehman Bros. analyst Josie Esquivel shaved her third-quarter estimate to 92 cents a share from $ 1. For the year ending in May, she cut her estimate to $ 4 a share from $ 4.13. Montgomery Securities analyst Alice Ruth cut her estimate to 95 cents a share from $ 1.10 for the third quarter and to $ 3.85 from $ 4 for the year. Both cited a 33% drop inNike's''refill'' orders for the third quarter. Refill orders are spot orders from retailers to shore up their inventories.&nbsp;Still, Esquivel says the soft market for athletic shoes that cost more than $ 100 a pair will be temporary. She ''strongly reiterated'' her buy recommendation. But Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Gary Jacobson saysNikeis facing a period of slow growth. With the slack economy, ''we're beginning to see customers shift away from high-priced footwear to lower priced shoes,'' he says. ''In a tough retail environment, if you have a high-priced item, you'll likely have problems.''He recommends shunningNikestock in favor of arch-competitor Reebok International, which fell 1/4 to $ 17 5/8 Thursday.

"Slip into a pair of shoe stocks and you may find your feet heading in opposite directions.In the first quarter, a group of five shoemakers was the fifth best of 87 stock groups tracked by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., rising 41%. But as more consumers repaired their old shoes or bought cheaper ones, shoe stocks fell 9% the second quarter and the group staggered to 81st.&nbsp;Now, shoe stocks are hot again. The group is up 14% this month, tops among the S&amp;P stock groups.What's going on here? Not enough, some analysts fear. They worry growth will slow as consumers scale back the variety of shoes they wear and continue to rebel against high-priced sneakers. Many view shoe stocks as overpriced now.''Domestic (shoe) consumption has been declining for a number of quarters,'' says Janet Mangano, publisher of The Johnson Redbook Service. ''The trend is disturbing. It continues to show decline.''Consumers bought 367 million pairs of shoes the first quarter - 3.3% less than the 379 million pairs purchased a year earlier, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department. Manufacturers reduced shipments 12% that quarter.''We're not recommending any'' of the shoe stocks, Mangano says flatly.Reebok International,NikeInc. and Stride Rite have managed to report good earnings this year. Stride Rite makes the popular - and low priced - Keds line. Reebok andNikemake expensive sneakers but also have popular low- priced shoes.The two other stocks in the S&amp;P group are dress-shoe makers Genesco Inc. and Brown Group, which have struggled due to the popularity of leisure shoes.Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson predicts flat sales forNikein the coming year. He has a weak hold recommendation on the stock. But he is recommending Reebok. Sales are jumping as result of a strong advertising push, he says. The Pump and Black Top lines are selling well , as are the company's shoes selling for less than $ 50.''The momentum is behind Reebok,'' he says. ''The Pump has been phenomenal.''Stride Rite's Keds line is doing well, according to a recent report by Courtney Smith of Pinnacle Capital Management. ''Solid products, excellent distribution and a strong balance sheet'' have positioned the company well for coming years, he notes.But insiders at Stride Rite may not be so sure. They have been selling stock in recent months - even as the stock advanced. Still, insider selling is an indication the stock may not go up much further.Derby Securities analyst Otto Grote doesn't give all shoe stocks the boot. ''The outlook for the family shoe business is pretty good,'' he says. ''There are only so many times you can repair a shoe.''He says Brown Group should benefit from good management even in the face of lower sales.

"Reebok International Ltd. wants advertising that's as hot as its shoes.Its new ad campaign goes toe-to-toe with rivalNikeInc. in the pithy advice department.&nbsp;The first ad, airing during Monday Night Football, shows a ''sky surfer'' - a white-clad sky diver riding a snow board - somersaulting above the French Alps in his Pump cross-training shoes. The theme: ''Life is short. Play hard.''Reebok, which will spend $ 25 million on the campaign, scored with the Pump - 4 million pairs sold in 18 months - and its Blacktop outdoor basketball shoes.

"AMID controversy and angst,Nike, the winged Greek goddess of victory, was hoisted back to the top of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin yesterday in preparation for the monument's 200th birthday celebrations on August 6.Almost destroyed a year and a half ago by joyful souvenir hunters on the first New Year's Eve after the Berlin Wall came down,Nikeand her four horses have spent the past 15 months having a Pounds 100,000 renovation to protect her from vandals and the environment.More than a thousand people turned out yesterday to watch as a crane lowered the copper statue and her chariot on to the 60ft high gate. Typically for modern Germany, however, the return of the goddess has provoked a profound argument about what she ought to symbolise. When she was locked away behind the wall staring eastwards down Unter den Linden at the decaying communist state, the triumphalism she once represented did not matter.&nbsp;In a united country, however,Nike'sreturn with Iron Cross and Prussian eagle on her staff, has created worries that she will give the wrong message to the world about German ambitions for the future. Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, has also run into criticism over his plan, announced yesterday, to attend the ceremony taking place in Potsdam on August 17, when the remains of Frederick the Great of Prussia are to be moved. Frau Herta Daubler-Gmelin, deputy chairman of the opposition Social Democrats complained that this would rouse mistrust in Germany's neighbours.Similar arguments are being roused by the statue ofNike. Two hundred years ago she was designed by Johann Schadow, court sculptor to King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, to represent Irene, the goddess of peace. Napoleon changed all that. When he arrived in the city fresh from his triumph at Jena in 1806 he liked the look of the statue and decided to pack it up and send it back to Paris as part of his booty. The goddess lived in exile for eight years until Field Marshall Blucher secured her release in 1814 after Napoleon's first defeat.She returned in triumph, not as Irene but asNike, complete with cross, oak leaves, and eagle. As such she presided over the victory parades of the Prussians, the German Empire and the Third Reich. In 1945, however, the gate and the statue were badly damaged in the battle for the city.Using the scrap and pictures as a model the East German government managed to copy and replace the statue in 1958 without the victory symbols, carefully describing her in the official guidebooks as ''the peace goddess''. Now Friedbert Pfluger, a Christian Democrat Bundestag member from the west German state of Lower Saxony, has started a protest movement about the symbols of victory on her staff.",0.016404040404,0.325002886003,456 words,Nikeconsultant joins sports marketing firm,"August 26, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",129 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers.  He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of &quot;sky surfing.&quot;It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing.  The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short.  Play Hard.&quot;&nbsp;That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the No.  2 spot and overtake its rival,Nike.The sky surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that debuted on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York.  The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology.  The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that for a variety of reasons fell short ofNike'subiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon.  As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on.  Reebok also last year was caught in a controversy with a campaign that depicted &quot;bungee jumping,&quot; an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges.At the same time, Reebok has been labeled a &quot;revolving door&quot; client by ad agencies.  The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bungee jumping ad.  Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day.  Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past.  But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.&quot;Reebok has been like a teenager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign.  &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things.  Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;If the campaign works, stock analysts expect it to move Reebok closer toNikein the $ 5.6 billion athletic shoe market.Nikelast year controlled 27 per cent to Reebok's 22 per cent of the market.Reebok has been demonstrating strong financial performance in the midst of a recession.  Second-quarter earnings were better than expected, rising 39 per cent to $ 60.3 million U.S., or 64 cents a share, from $ 43.3 million, or 38 cents, in the year-earlier period.Sales for the quarter, boosted by the success of the Pump line of shoes, rose 30 percent to $ 688 million, from $ 527 million in the same period of 1990.  Cost-cutting efforts also impressed analysts, several of whom noted that Fireman's pay cut saved the company $ 2 million in the second-quarter alone.Reebok also is expected to benefit from the corporate implosion of L.A.

"SINCE Reebok International Ltd. started selling its Pump basketball shoe 18 months ago, the company has shipped four million pairs of the inflatable sneakers. Pump sales alone have reached $500 million, a figure that would make the Pump the fourth-largest athletic shoe company in the United States if it were a separate company.Using savvy marketing and sports star endorsements, Reebok, No. 2 afterNikein the highly competitive athletic footwear market, is riding the Pump to what industry analysts say is the beginning of a new surge. The company had been stuck on a three-year treadmill after a spectacular rise in the mid-1980's. Profits were basically flat from 1987 to 1990.&nbsp;In 1990 Reebok, based in Stoughton, near Boston, shipped 75 million pairs of athletic shoes worldwide and saw revenues grow by more than 18 percent, to $2.2 billion. Analysts predict that will increase to $2.6 billion this year on the strength of innovative products and a growing international business.Company officials and financial analysts point to the Pump as the main force in the turnaround. &quot;The Pump gives them a foundation for their marketing,&quot; said Alice Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.The Pump has an air bladder built into the upper portion of the shoe. Pumping a small button on the tongue inflates the bladder and helps the shoe conform to the shape of the wearer's foot. A small valve at the back of the shoe lets the air out.Reebok now sells nine categories of Pump shoes, including ones for golf, aerobics and tennis, at prices of $95 to $110. The company is planning to offer cleated pumps for baseball and soccer. A Reebok spokesman said Roger Clemens, the Boston Red Sox pitcher, wore a pair of prototype baseball Pumps in a recent game at Fenway Park.&quot;High tech&quot; shoes like the Pump and the new Catapult by L. A. Gear have been criticized lately as more expensive fashion statements than well-made, well-fitting and high-performance shoes. But many teen-agers and weekend athletes recall scenes like those provided by Dee Brown, the Boston Celtics rookie, who won the Slam Dunk competition this year, held in conjunction with the N.B.A. All-Star game. Before each run-up to the basket to stuff the ball through the hoop, he reached down and inflated his Reebok Pumps, which the company pays him to wear.He said Reebok knew nothing of his plans to pump his Pumps, but the show he put on helped crystallize what the marketing of the technology has meant for Reebok.Analysts project another surge for Reebok this year. Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, estimates earnings of $2.05 a share this year and $2.60 in 1992, up from $1.54 in 1990. Mr. Jacobson and Ms. Ruth rate Reebok stock as a strong &quot;buy.&quot; They think it could sell in the $30-a-share range by the end of the year. The stock closed yesterday at $23.125, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.&quot;The company is doing a number of things right,&quot; Mr. Jacobson said. &quot;The Pump continues to gain market share; they are introducing strong new casual and fashion lines; their apparel line is ready to explode, and international is showing 50 percent-plus growth.&quot;Reebok's biggest concern, analysts say, is soft retail sales for athletic footwear. &quot;The athletic footwear segment is mature,&quot; Ms. Ruth said, &quot;which makes this more a market-share game than it ever has been.&quot;In fact, Reebok is making money by gaining market share, analysts said. The company is reportedly cutting intoNike'slead, though analysts do not expect it to overtakeNikesoon.Nikeholds 30 percent of the market and Reebok 24 percent.Paul Duncan, Reebok's chief financial officer, said the company was not focused on passingNike.&quot;We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,&quot; said Mr. Duncan, who has a shelf of caps labeled &quot;Nike-buster&quot; in his office. &quot;We are a marketing company. We build brands.&quot;Reebok recently introduced the Blacktop, a new basketball shoe aimed at outdoor hoop enthusiasts. The shoe is lightweight, but has thicker and stronger soles than other basketball shoes.&quot;The sneaker business generally is more sizzle than steak,&quot; said Steven Frankel, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. &quot;But the Blacktop has some real steak to it. It's innovative and the competition doesn't have it.&quot; By March, Blacktop orders were at 1.5 million pairs, an exceptional start for a new product, Ms. Ruth said.Since 1986, Reebok has acquired four companies with high-quality brand names. By buying Avia and Ellesse, two athletic footwear competitors, along with Rockport shoes and the Boston Whaler boat maker, Reebok hopes to broaden its image beyond footwear.Though Boston Whaler is not yet profitable and Avia is trying to overcome some problems, Ellesse and Rockport are adding substantially to Reebok's bottom line.Reebok, which made its initial splash and fortune with aerobic shoes, is trying to revitalize that niche with its Step Reebok program. Based on a relatively new exercise program called low-impact aerobics that uses a step stool (which Reebok also sells), the company is betting that a grass-roots interest in step aerobics will emerge.",0.0761132154882,0.408672138047,870 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"February 6, 1991, Wednesday",132 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"In recent summers, men have headed to the beach clad in snug bikini trunks, feet bare or shod in loose-fitting flip-flops. But in the summer of 1991, snug trunks are outnumbered by loose-fitting briefs. And it's the new beach shoes of choice that are worn snug.Nike'sAqua Gear collection of coordinated swimwear and water sport shoes has kept fashion and sales pace with the increased popularity of sports like wind surfing and wave running (the latter refers to riding a water vehicle that looks like a snowmobile). These sports call for steady footing and, of course, the pulled-together bearing that matching shorts and shoes imply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike'sAqua Socks, actually slip-on shoes, consist of neoprene soles with treads, built-in arch support and reinforced toes and molded heels, with ankle-high uppers of an airy spandex mesh in flashy neon colors.This summer, they're not worn just by the sports-minded.Aqua Socks protect feet from hot sand, sharp shells and glass, and give traction on mucky lake bottoms and slippery rocks.

"WITH Bo Jackson sidelined, marketing experts have been wondering who will replace him as the best pitchman in advertising. Some believe the next superstar endorser is David Robinson. David knows basketball.Mr. Robinson, the 7-foot 1-inch center for the San Antonio Spurs, is already the stuff of legend, a rare professional athlete whose basketball scores (25.6 points a game on average) were rivaled, relatively speaking, by his Scholastic Aptitude Test scores (1,320 out of 1,600).&nbsp;A mathematics major at the United States Naval Academy, Mr. Robinson served a two-year hitch with the Navy, remains a lieutenant and civil engineer in the Reserves, won a bronze medal as a member of the 1988 United States Olympic basketball team, is a concert pianist and in 1990 was voted the National Basketball Association's rookie of the year.Marketers are always searching for the next great endorser, in hopes that the celebrity's aura will lend a magic glow to their product or service. There are those who say Mr. Robinson's future is limitless.&quot;I think without a doubt David Robinson has superstar qualities,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, the director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago firm that matches athletes with advertising agencies. &quot;Very often, when an agency calls us, they'll not know who they want, and we'll always recommend Robinson and they'll say, 'Oh, yeah!' And if the agency has already been reviewing basketball stars, Robinson's name is always on the list.&quot;While he was still in the Navy, Mr. Robinson signed endorsement contracts with Casio watches and Franklin Sports Industries. He also signed withNikeInc., the athletic shoe company that made &quot;Bo knows&quot; part of the American vernacular.Nikelured Mr. Robinson into a five-year, $1 million endorsement deal in 1988, before he joined the Spurs. A year ago, the company inaugurated a $15 million advertising campaign for its Force basketball shoe line, with the giant center as the star of &quot;Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood,&quot; a parody of the children's show &quot;Mister Rogers's Neighborhood.&quot;&quot;Not only is David Robinson what some people consider the future of basketball -- a big man who's incredibly fast -- but he's also an exceptionally wonderful human being,&quot; said Jim Riswold, an associate creative director at Wieden &amp; Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., advertising agency that handlesNike.&quot;When I walked out of my first meeting with him a couple of years ago, it was his niceness that impressed me,&quot; Mr. Riswold said. &quot;Michael Prieve, an agency art director, agreed and suggested that there was nobody nicer than children's show hosts. We built from there, and that's what you see.&quot;In each of the dozen or so spots Wieden &amp; Kennedy has filmed, Mr. Robinson invites the audience, and sometimes a guest star, into his realm -- the basketball court -- to learn a new word or phrase. When Charles Barkley, the obstreperous forward of the Philadelphia 76er's, was the guest, Mr. Robinson asked, &quot;Can you say, 'Fined?' &quot;The commercials have not been without controversy. Last year, after viewer complaints,Nikecanceled an ad that ran during the World Series in which Mr. Robinson asked, &quot;Can you say, 'Kick some butt?' &quot;Jeff Austin, a vice president of Advantage International and Mr. Robinson's agent, said the Spurs' center recently signed two other large endorsement contracts, but declined to identify the companies involved.Ms. Lanktree, the sports marketing executive, said Mr. Robinson's allure was based partly on intangible factors. &quot;You're talking about a young man, a concert pianist, 1,300 S.A.T. scores, and he still thanks his coaches for teaching him,&quot; she said.But Ms. Lanktree also noted that Mr. Robinson was benefiting from canny marketing by the N.B.A. itself, which has moved to broaden pro basketball's somewhat elitist image.&quot;Ten years ago, the N.B.A. was a spectator sport that rich people went to see,&quot; Ms. Lanktree said. &quot;Now the general public is getting to know it and its stars, like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, and they're giving the game more mass appeal. David Robinson is in on the ground floor of its growth.&quot;For all that, there are still those who say it will be hard for Mr. Robinson to achieve Bo Jackson's level as an endorser. Mr. Jackson reportedly earned about $2 million a year fromNikeand $3 million from A.T.&amp;T., Pepsico and other companies.Martin E. Blackman, whose New York firm, Blackman &amp; Raber, is a top matchmaker between athletes and advertisers, said Mr. Robinson would suffer from his prowess in just one sport and his team's location in the Southwest. He will not receive &quot;year-round ink,&quot; as Mr. Jackson, a two-sport man, did; nor will he receive heavy coverage in a media center, as Mr. Jackson, who played football for the Los Angeles Raiders, did.&quot;When you talk in terms of advertising in this country, you're talking about New York and Chicago, where the big agencies are,&quot; Mr. Blackman said. &quot;L.A. also gets exposure. Michael Jordan playing basketball for the Chicago Bulls; it doesn't hurt that McDonald's ad agency, Leo Burnett, is there. And Michael Jordan is doing a big thing for McDonald's.&quot;&quot;I believe David Robinson will become a leading product spokesperson, because he's got what it takes,&quot; Mr. Blackman concluded. &quot;But I don't see him yet in the sphere of Michael Jordan or Bo Jackson.&quot;Mr. Robinson's agent, Mr. Austin, is not worried. &quot;David does not necessarily want his name on 50 products,&quot; he said. &quot;That approach is appropriate for Mary Lou Retton, whose celebrity is more of-the-moment. David is going to have longevity.&quot;",0.129985369569,0.413898909732,938 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"June 7, 1991, Friday, Late Edition - Final",134 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Chiat/Day/Mojo in New York has regained a large part of the Reebok International account after the sport-shoe company abruptly pulled its $US40 million account from Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos last Friday.The business will be split between Chiat/Day/Mojo and Lois/GGK.Reebok would not comment on its reasons for dismissing Hill, Holiday, a move that comes a little less than a year after the Boston agency won the account in a highly publicised review.&nbsp;But agency executives said Reebok had made the move because Hill, Holiday's ads failed to create excitement for the company's athletic shoes or to gain ground onNike, which is number one.Executives at Hill, Holiday would not comment. The agency had produced only one big campaign for Reebok. With the tag-line &quot;It's time to play&quot;, the ads showed athletes and others playing in their Reeboks.Some agency executives said Reebok had become desperate to find a hardhitting campaign to use against the comparative ads from some of its competitors, and it turned to Lois/GGK late last year to produce commercials for its &quot;pump&quot; shoes.The campaign from Lois/GGK, called &quot;Pump up and Air out&quot;, featured athletes taking a swipe atNike'sspokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association, and the maker's Air Jordan shoes.The campaign was criticised by its competitors and some agency executives because it took what they said was an unwarranted pot-shot at Jordan.Ms Bernadette Mansur, a spokeswoman for Reebok, said the company was pleased with the ads from Lois/GGK. &quot;They created a buzz about Reebok with retailers and consumers,&quot; she said.Although Chiat/Day had resigned the bulk of the Reebok account in January 1990 after it was put in review, the agency has continued to create advertising for the company's Weeboks children's shoes and for its business outside the United States.Agency executives said Reebok was a difficult client. The said the company demanded innovative approaches but then often criticised an agency for &quot;being too creative&quot;.Chiat/Day, which had the entire Reebok account for three years before the bulk of it went to Hill, Holiday, lost the account in large part because of its quirky &quot;Reebok lets UBU&quot; campaign, which Reebok executives reportedly thought was too far out.The commercials showed people doing idiosyncratic things such as vacuuming a carpet on a lawn.The ads were criticised within the advertising industry for not focusing on the performance of the athletic shoes and for not increasing sales.While Chiat/Day had the account, Reebok lost its number one position toNike.Chiat/Day handles the pan-European Reebok business out of its London office, and South-East Asian business from Singapore.Now that Reebok is back, Mr Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive world-wide of Chiat/Day/Mojo, said he was pleased. &quot;It's great,&quot; he said. &quot;Clients don't often return to an agency.&quot;Reebok is the latest in a number of clients who have split their accounts between agencies to double their chances of getting good work.In the past few years both Burger King and IBM have divided their businessAlthough this set-up could obviously foster competitive rivalries, Mr George Lois, the chairman and chief executive of Lois/GGK, said he was not worried.&quot;There is no reason we can't be a great team,&quot; he said.",0.045326315099,0.509899645809,555 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"August 11, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final",135 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"It's official. Well almost. Half the tennis world thinks Andre Agassi is an irrepressible, lovable brat; the other half finds him an insufferable little prat. Or, in the local south London vernacular, a plonker.In a recent national TV poll in the US, he topped the polls for both the most popular and least popular person playing tennis today. That should surprise no-one: Andre is, by his own admission, a kinda crazy, mixed-up guy, drooled over by teenyboppers, damned by the traditionalists.Love him or loathe him, as they always seem to be saying of Andre, many people were counting on being able to ignore him and his hype this week at Wimbledon.&nbsp;Alas, it has not been possible.The brat is back-four years, almost to the day, since being sent from SW19 after a humiliating straight-sets defeat by Henri Leconte. Between times, Agassi has won 12 tour titles (although, significantly, no grand slam yet), established himself as one of the world's top players on clay, and risen to fifth overall, with prize money to date of more than $A6 million.While doing so, he has repeatedly declined to play Wimbledon, saying he needed a rest and, anyway, his style of play was not suited to the faster grass courts.Now, aged 21, he returns, not much more mature, but a considerably improved player and infinitely more marketable.Just askNike, whose clothing he wears (sometimes he seems to wear them all at once, in clashing Technicolor) as part of a deal worth more than $A5 million a year. Marketing boss Ian Hamilton says Agassi is the company's biggest asset these days,Nike'sJohn McEnroe notwithstanding.Or, just ask the kids selling postcards from a kiosk in front of the All England Club; they confirm that Agassi portraits have been outselling pix of all the girls put together this week.Never mind that the buyers tend to be female and under 14, Agassi has become a megastar, albeit one whose court performances are still trying to catch up with his razzle-dazzle showbiz persona.Of course, just as the Fawlty Towers waiter Manuel was explained away as being &quot;from Barcelona&quot;, so Andre Agassi is &quot;from Las Vegas&quot;.

They seem pretty innocuous, in fact. Like many All American boys, Agassi did a little pot, drank a lot of Jack Daniels and, in an attempt to upset his teachers, grew his hair long.Nowadays, he insists, the length of every flowing, multi-coloured hair on that treasured head is stipulated in his sponsorship contracts. And the mainstays in his life are not drink and drugs but God, two Porsches, a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, and a cockatoo named Fred (although not necessarily in that order, one suspects).Whether Agassi really believes his own publicity is doubtful. While publicly he wants to be a hard-assed rad dude, privately he is more Ninja Turtle: not exactly self-effacing but less vulgar, more vulnerable.Certainly, the man-child who enjoyed the recent French Open so much he pronounced himself &quot;as happy as a faggot in a submarine&quot; has come to Wimbledon anxious not to upset the strawberry cart.Critics recall with horror how a year ago he clashed with the International Tennis Federation over the dress code, calling its chief, Phillipe Chatrier, a bozo.It now transpires that months ago he andNikeboss Hamilton reassured the All England Club that Agassi, if he played at Wimbledon, would not turn up looking like a mad dog's dinner. Of possible clashes with the Establishment over his clothes, he demurely explained: &quot;I have no trouble with the traditions of Wimbledon.

So deferential was his demeanour he even bowed to the royal box. The rest was hysteria: Wimbledon welcomed Agassi.Today, at least, it had decided he was the most popular man in tennis.Even in the short time he was on court before further showers had him running for cover, he demonstrated that somewhere inside the floppy shirt, denim shorts and Lycra pants (be they white or kaleidoscopically wacky) is an exciting and extravagantly skilled player. He's no net rusher, that's for sure, but his powerful ground shots, hit with wicked top spin, are complemented by pace and inventiveness about the court.Given his inexperience on grass, he was expected to struggle early against the left-handed Connell, ranked 73rd in the world, but who this month had beaten Ivan Lendl.So it proved.

"LEN McKENDRY has sprung one of the surprises of the season by recommending temperamental Heidelberg winger Angie Goutzioulis to national coach Eddie Thomson.Goutzioulis has earned three weeks of suspension from bookings and landed an extra week after being sent off early in the game against Wollongong City.But McKendry retained his belief in the player's ability and was justly rewarded when he turned on a match winning performance against Marconi on Sunday.&nbsp;McKendry said Goutzioulis tore apart Marconi full-back Robert Wheatley and was instrumental in Heidelberg's upset 1-0 win.&quot;I prefer to describe Angie as highly-spirited rather than difficult to handle, and there is no doubting he is a tremendous prospect,&quot; McKendry said.&quot;He's got a bad name unnecessarily and I'm trying to convince Eddie Thomson to have a closer look at him.&quot;Certainly for us on Sunday, he was given a defensive job as well as going forward, and he did marvellously for us in both areas.&quot; Goutzioulis admitted yesterday that the coach had a quiet word after his sending off.&quot;Aggression is part of my game but I'm not temperamental,&quot; he said.&quot;I would like to think I have matured with the bad experience and believe I can play with contained aggression from now on.&quot; Goutzioulis' performance earns him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.The weekly winner receives a pair ofNikeAir runners valued at $280.The end of season winner collects $2000 cash fromNike.Rather than talk about his performance, Goutzioulis prefers to concentrate on the improving form of Heidelberg and has confidently predicted the side can collect another big scalp - that of Melbourne Croatia - this Sunday.&quot;It's the first time in 20 weeks that we are at full strength and I really fancy our chances,&quot; he said.Goutzioulis broke into the NSL as a central striker, but says he is enjoying his role as a wide player more.&quot;I've got a bit of defensive work to do, but playing wide allows to run at players and that suits my game a lot more.&quot; ERNIE TAPAI, recovering from a knee operation, has given himself an outside chance of returning to on-field action providing Adelaide City makes the championship play-offs.

"Staid Wimbledon set for fashion sensation London FORGET the tennis one of the most constantly asked questions as the countdown to Wimbledon hits top gear is: &quot;Just what will Andre Agassi be wearing?&quot; Not since Gussie Moran outraged the establishment with her lace pants in 1949 has fashion been so prominent in pre-Wimbledon discussions.While Agassi licks his wounds over losing last week's French Open final to fellow American Jim Courier, it seems almost everyone else is licking their lips in anticipation of what the luminous lad from Las Vegas will turn out in when he makes his much-anticipated Wimbledon return in 11 days. During this year's Parisian sojourn Agassi followed up his lava pink outfit of 1990 by bustling around the red clay courts of Roland Garros in a black, purple and white combination.That ensemble is certainly out of the question for the staid lawns of Wimbledon, where anything but predominantly white is no-go.&nbsp;So just what will Agassi, or rather his sponsors,Nike, come up with for the All England Championships, which start on Monday week? The man himself is not saying.&quot;You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,&quot; Agassi said when asked in Paris.The world No 5 is revelling in the tease surrounding his choice of garb. He andNikeknow a good marketing ploy when they see one.Agassi is also reported to be exclusively contracted to reveal all to a London tabloid newspaper.Despite the secrecy rumours abound.The word, according to one media hound, is that the Las Vegas showman will turn out for his first match in classical white from his headband down to his cycling shorts.After that, he said, Agassi was likely to introduce a lightly coloured outfit.Reports this week saidNike, after discussing designs with Agassi, had been putting alternatives to the All England Committee and referee Alan Mills for approval.At the centre of the commotion is rule 8 of Wimbledon's &quot;Conditions of Entry and Participation&quot; which states that except for the warm-up period, all competitors must be dressed &quot;predominantly in white&quot; during matches.To contravene the rule leaves a player liable for default.John McEnroe is among its more famous victims, when he was required to change his dark blue shorts on centre court.The Times newspaper said no one could quite remember when the rule was cast in iron, but Wimbledon is the only one of the four Grand Slam tournaments to have such a strict dress code.Last year Agassi's hot pink outfit caused Philippe Chatrier, head of both the French Tennis Federation and International Tennis Federation, to suggest the introduction of a &quot;predominantly white&quot; rule for the French Open.It led to a war of words with Agassi during the 1990 titles, but the issue did not arise this month when Agassi turned out in Paris in his toned-down, yet still colourful, combination.The &quot;predominantly white&quot; tradition is not greeted with enthusiasm by the multi-million dollar leisurewear industry.Last year Italian clothing outfit Diadora, which had guaranteed Jennifer Capriati $4.65 million for a five-year contract, had its range for the American whiz-kid turned down just before her Wimbledon debut.The teenager, at the age of 14, was the youngest player to appear at Wimbledon and was the media sensation of the year.&quot;You want to be able to make stuff you can sell,&quot; said Ian Hamilton ofNike.&quot;One of the problems is that 'predominantly white' does not sell and we can't keep producing clothes we cannot sell in shops.&quot; Alfred Schwarz, head of sports promotions for Adidas, which has Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf as clients, told The Times : &quot;The ruling makes us nervous because we have to guess when we produce our ranges what will be acceptable to Wimbledon, but it is very difficult to get all the manufacturers together to lobby for a more precise definition.&quot;From an image point of view, Wimbledon is the most watched event of any through the year.&quot;It has a certain meaning, but the design rule is a problem, and we feel that is our domain, not Wimbledon's.&quot; For Wimbledon, however, a priority is to protect the championships' tradition.Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, admitted the rule was ill-defined but said officials did not think it right to stipulate any percentage of white.&quot;A very small amount of psychedelic colouring can be off-putting, while a pastel-coloured shirt could be perfectly acceptable,&quot; he said.&quot;We feel and I think the players feel too that this is one of our better traditions.&quot; Agassi, whose talent is undoubted, will be making his first appearance at Wimbledon since 1987, when he was beaten in the first round.His ability to hone his hard court game to the vagaries of grass is not the only thing everyone is waiting to see.",0.0985685941043,0.443327664399,806 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"March 26, 1991 Tuesday",139 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;Bo knows doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo knows fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His future?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo can't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, Bo Jackson seemed an unlimited and indestructible athlete. Fast as the Gulf wind, strong as a bull, and overendowed by the athletic gods. Star of the NFL, MLB andNike.Able to slug baseballs farther than anybody, and run with footballs as few have, and mesmerize a public that couldn't get enough of watching him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the super sneaker salesman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the Royals slugger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo, the Raiders racer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, and shockingly, Bo Jackson's mortality surfaced.  Turns out, he's human. Like you, like me, the 225-pound multisport Adonis is breakable. Wearing his black No. 34 football jersey, Jackson mangled a hip while straining for a first down in a Los Angeles Raiders playoff game Jan. 13. It may wind up being the kryptonite for this Superman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kansas City Royals teammate George Brett, a witness as Bo bounded away from baseball spring training on crutches, detected a &quot;Man, I'm scared&quot; look in Jackson eyes that have forever been cool, clever and cocksure. &quot;Bo's never thought there was anything he couldn't do,&quot; Brett said, &quot;but now he's worried he may never play again.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo is 28.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the L.A. Coliseum the afternoon Jackson went down against the Cincinnati Bengals. Carted away, he gave a thumbs-up, promising to &quot;definitely be in Buffalo&quot; for the following week's AFC Championship Game. I believed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo didn't make it. He may never. On Monday, Jackson vowed to play baseball in the 1991 season. This time, I don't believe him. You wonder, does Bo believe Bo? Royals management thinks so little of his recuperative chances that Jackson's $ 2,375,000 contract was voided Monday, and Kansas City general manager Herk Robinson made him available to major-league rivals for the $ 1 waiver price.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A buck for Bo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a tragedy to rival Lou Gehrig's disease, or golfer Tony Lema's death in a plane crash, or George Gipp being struck down at Notre Dame. No matter what happens, Bo Jackson should be rich, famous, marketable and able to do almost anything but play football and baseball. He'll still have a good wife, and wonderful kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you're Superman, you expect to always leap tall buildings. I predict Jackson will work inhumanly hard, sweating through rehab, trying to prove the Royals wrong, along with anybody else who suggests he's finished. Bo is a different breed, and he has spent a young lifetime getting kicks out of doing the unforecastable thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics said Jackson would never make it in professional baseball because he struck out in more than half his at-bats at Auburn University. We now know different. Bo kept on whiffing, but my how he has whacked the ball in the American League.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampa Bay made Bo its No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and voices kept saying that Jackson &quot;had to play.&quot; Again, he proved us wrong, and took delight in doing it. Bo chose baseball, but once the Bucs were out of his life, the football thoughts returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like me said Jackson would never be able to play both major-league baseball and in the National Football League. It has been a stretch, and not totally satisfactory for either the Royals or Raiders, but Bo has come remarkably close to pulling it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, when Jackson crumbled in Los Angeles, it seemed time for the young multimillionaire to loosen hisNikesand make a choice. Do one sport, but not both. Enough of the carnival act, of being part-Royal and part-Raider. Bo's sensible decision had to be baseball, where his career might last another 10 years, if he could give up his combative &quot;hobby&quot; of football.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the choice may be gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have tears in my eyes, but instead there's an emptiness in my stomach. There is a wide-bodied loss. Bo Jackson has unique appeal. He puts paying fannies into ballpark seats. AskNikehow he sells. Sports needs characters, and superhuman talents. Bo has been a little of both. I always wondered how good a baseball player might he be if he would give up football? Or how marvelous a Raider would he become if football was his only game?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may never know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bo may never know.",0.0983660130719,0.517810457516,726 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"February 22, 1991 Friday",141 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;So I am about to turn Jack Benny's eternal age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To perhaps half the readers of the column, this disclosure will be significant only in its grand insignificance, a laughable announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have known the other side of 39 and then some for a while now and live with restraint and dignity, on fixed incomes usually, while sneering at Aging Boomers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead. You have plenty of company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advertising mavens think people like me are such saps that all , they have to do is make up some snappy ad and we'll just dash out and slap down our Visa card for lineless bifocals, Lycra tights and Gap turtlenecks anything to prop up our delusion that we are exempt from the toll of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be sure, though, that this advertising rubbish has had no impact on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, you will see, is another form of delusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picture it: I was window-shopping in the local sports shop. The first thing I did was snap up one of those costumes fit for wearing while suffering muscle pulls and trying to fool the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I spied the poster. Because there is such a thing in the world as principle, I passed up the impulse to buy it although it turned out the poster wasn't for sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just memorized the way it looked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poster, actually an ad forNike,featured a nearly life-sized black and white '50s-era photo of a kid in pigtails who could have been Beaver's first girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superimposed over the photo was a string of words about how this was really a picture of what a 40-year-old woman looks like.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message this medium conveyed was that cliche, dusted off and dressed up to be hip, about how you're only as old as you feel.  And how you can run that marathon and overhaul your lumpy self, even if you are 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of advice that desperate Aging Boomers really need to hear anything to spend money and to dress like Jimmy Connors, who did so remarkably well, for a 39-year-old, at the U.S.  Open last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I get it right, the advertising mavens are telling me I should run, swim, bike, jump, hop, swing, kick, pitch, punt, row, lift, squeeze, push, pull, stretch, lean, throw, flex, walk, skate and skip into new shape and strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been trying to do that. People who know my former, lumpy self would hardly recognize me now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But guess what else happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran into the one hitch that the people atNikenever tell you about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so busy exercising, there wasn't time for anything else. Not watching a movie or writing a book or dreaming a dream or listening to a friend, not sweeping the floor, doing the laundry, or contemplating the future and my place in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible discovery, worse than confronting crow's feet or sagging skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older you get, the less time you have to do things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're 20, life is a limitless vista, a free lunch, a Monopoly game where the bad plays don't count.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're 40, you can make a list of the bad plays already and you wish somebody would fold up the game board and pull out, maybe, Trivial Pursuit. You've done pretty well at that, metaphorically speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start making lists of the trips you want to take, the people you want to meet, the jobs you'd rather have. You start considering a new set of choices, and this time, you vow to get them right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start picturing yourself with the lines and the creases that are coming regardless. And you don't hesitate to get annoyed at people whom you suspect are wasting your time including those advertising mavens who concoct clever ads to sell $ 100Nikeshoes to Aging Boomers and are probably already working on ads to sell us workout shoes for our retirement, if we have any money left then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the gift that comes when you turn Jack Benny's eternal age: an awareness of time, how it is a resource no longer for wasting, how it moves faster than you, until there is no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is why everybody, even couch potatoes, wears running shoes: to fool ourselves into thinking we can keep up.",-0.0183816738817,0.472784992785,708 words,Reebok plays hard; Firm playing for keeps in the race to catchNike,"March 14, 1991 Thursday",142 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"There's no trick to finding the Georgia Dome these days. It finds&nbsp;you. Nine months ago the $ 210 million project was merely a few concrete&nbsp;footings.

"The sporting goods industry resembles Dominique Wilkins's missed&nbsp;slam-dunk in this year's NBA All-Star game: There's still plenty of&nbsp;spring in its legs, but maybe not what there used to be.That was the message, in effect, that John D.

"&nbsp;WHEN England have friends likeNike,who have a contract to supply the squad with boots, they might well begin to wonder who their enemies are. That company's full-page advert in yesterday's national newspapers - 'Scotland the Brave (they'd better be)' - could hardly be less appropriate to a World Cup semi-final that cries out for skill and enterprise instead of the muscle and mayhem that has largely dominated the tournament.'It's going to be rough. It's going to be tough. It's going to be fierce (and that's just in the tunnel).' WhetherNike'sgung-ho copy is a tasteless incitement to violence or even a half-baked reference to the Dubroca affair, the implication that rugby football is just a brutal collision is surely not the image the competition is trying to project to millions of television viewers around the globe.&nbsp;England, one assumes, will want to demonstrate that their game plan involves something more than a pack of ageing forwards riding roughshod (albeit inNikeboots) over their hosts in an updated version of Culloden. Not that the Scots, who are no innocents in an alley fight, will allow themselves to be intimidated and mentally disconcerted as France were in Paris a week ago.To their credit, both Geoff Cooke and Ian McGeechan have sought to play down the unhealthy nationalist hype that has inevitably built up around this latest Anglo-Scottish clash. In recent seasons the Calcutta Cup has produced a series of appalling dog fights with just four tries in the last four matches. The danger is that today's game will follow the same depressing stop-start-stop pattern despite the knockout context that should in theory put a premium on scoring tries.It is time England began to live up to the 'run with the ball' campaign they launched with a glitzy fanfare in Kensington last month. Led by shop steward and corporate lawyer Brian Moore, the players hope to emerge with at least pounds 5,000 each - cash that can only really be justified by providing the kind of spectacle that actually involves . . . yes, running with the ball. If this well-heeled lot want to live by the readies they have a duty to entertain.In fact, England should not find it so difficult to remind the world that rugby is after all a handling game and not just an interminable kick-and-chase. This week one bomb-weary wag remarked that the Webb Ellis Trophy should be renamed the Garryowen Cup (with a special lifetime achievement award for Rob Andrew), yet excellent ball handlers such as Halliday, Guscott, Ackford, Teague and Carling all have ability to rebut such criticism at Murrayfield.It has been clear that England's problem about moving the ball wide springs from a lack of nerve, notwithstanding the huge amount of talent in the back division. Under the influence of the coaches an expansive game has come to be perceived as a losing ticket, even though England were beaten in the 1990 Grand Slam decider mainly because they were unable or unwilling to run the ball. On the single occasion they moved it wide swiftly Guscott scored a magnificent try.Of course, this semi-final is not merely a question of releasing the backs, important as that is. England will surely attempt to exploit the 6ft 7in Doddie Weir's lack of international experience in the middle of the line-out where Wade Dooley, 13 years his senior, knows all the relevant ploys. No doubt Cooke was stepping up the propaganda war when he said: 'I felt I might have preferred Damian Cronin (to Weir) because of his experience.'One suspects, though, that the outcome will turn on the confrontation between the two oldest international back rows in the business. If Teague, Skinner and Winterbottom can plunder the same share of loose ball they claimed from the French then it is difficult to see England losing. Kickable penalties, if not tries, are bound to follow as Scotland battle to contain the pressure.Yet that neat theory fails to take account of the marauding power of Jeffrey, White and Calder who together are close to setting a world record for international appearances. This charismatic trio - who hope to make their swansong in the final - have a genius for attacking (and defending) around the fringes that has often smothered England's best efforts. As long as they all remain on the field no one can predict a Scotland defeat.It is tempting to forecast triumph for an England side whose confidence is sky high after coming through their special version of Waterloo. But Scotland are defending a three-year unbeaten run at Murrayfield, stretching to 13 victories. More to the point, perhaps, the Scots have a cool belief in their own ability to beat anyone, including New Zealand.As Calder remarked the other day, the outcome could well depend on a single fortuitous bounce of the ball, as it arguably did when Stanger scored his opportunist try for the Scots last year. No two matches between England and Scotland, however, are quite the same. All one can reasonably expect, whateverNikesay, is that nothing nasty happens in the tunnel before or after.",0.0425715382342,0.502374813941,852 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"April 4, 1991, Thursday",150 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;LIBERATIONTHE strain is beginning to show on Adidas as it struggles to keep its lead over US-basedNikeand Reebok in the European sports shoe market. Directors of Adidas, the German firm which sold a majority stake to French entrepreneur Bernard Tapie last year, confirmed at Munich's Sports Clothing Trade Fair that they are stripping off everying apart from the precious trade name to keep ahead.Far Eastern rights to Coq Sportif - the football boots to tennis shoes and clothing label, and most of the Arena leisure wear brands - were sold last year. In spring the Arena beachwear range will be up for grabs.&nbsp;Now it seems that the 'for sale' sign has been hoisted over Pony, the US-based footwear brand, and Erima, the soccer strip company. And there may be more pruning.'We don't need so many brand names,' admits managing director Rene Jaggi, while Hans Friederichs, chairman of the supervisory board, adds: 'We need to concentrate on a single brand.'Bernard Tapie has thus had to swallow his ambitions of turning Adidas into a high fashion brand name and follow the more realistic strategy of the German heads of the group of returning to the sports field and concentrating on its strongest points - sports shoes and clothing, as well as delivery of products on time.The income from the sale of the other brands will provide a welcome injection of capital, for although Adidas went into the black in 1990, its finances remain precarious, with a profit of only DM30 million (Pounds 10 million) on a turnover of DM3,355 million.'In three years' time, we'll be the biggest in Europe,' Bertrand Gaillochet, director ofNike-France, predicts confidently. The firm will intensify its successful ploy of associating its name with the most popular sportsmen and women from top to toe and telling the whole world about it.Adidas recognises its weakness in the face of its American competitors. In France and Germany (40 per cent of its turnover) the firm does not expect further growth. 'We have to make enormous efforts just to stay at the same level.'There remains the American market, of which Adidas has only 3-4 per cent. 'If there's going to be any growth, that's where it will come from,' concludes the Adidas chairman. This ambition leavesNikecold. 'I shall not comment on their strategy,' replies Richard Donahue,Nikepresident, 'simply because I can't understand it.'Copyright The Guardian/Liberation",0.189265873016,0.472076719577,411 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"May 13, 1991, Monday",151 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;SHOOTING A BULLET with a bullet is, in effect, what the Army's Patriot missiledoes when it kills an incoming Scud.  So far, the Patriot appears to be knocking down each Scud that has come under fire. This stems from a mixture of high technology and luck.  Finding a defense against ballistic missiles - missiles whose flight path forms a high, inverted ''U'' at thousands of miles a hour - has become for military researchers the hunt for the Holy Grail.  For more than 40 years, the United States has invested tens of billions of dollars in trying to develop an anti-missile missile. TheNike-Zeus program of the '50s gave way to the Spartan and Sprint programs of the '60s.  The search slowed slightly after 1972, when the United States and the Soviets signed an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting each to only one anti-missile launching area.  Still, anti-missile research continued through the '70s. It exploded in the '80s under President Ronald Reagan, who launched the Strategic Defense Initiative - instantly dubbed ''Star Wars.'' Although the Patriot incorporates some of the Star Wars technology, the program itself dates back almost 30 years and is rooted in the Sam-D anti-aircraft missile of the early '60s.  At that time, the Army wanted: A replacement for itsNikeHercules (a high-altitude anti-aircraft missile) and its Hawk, at least as its medium-altitude role.  A more self-contained missile unit, or battery, that would allow soldiers to move it more quickly around the battlefield.&nbsp;The most accurate missile in the world - a specification that caused big problems.  This cutting-edge-of-technology approach nearly killed the Patriot in Congress because it added billions of dollars in cost and forced a 15-year development program.  But in the end, the extra money and time let the Patriot blast Scuds from the sky.  Each Patriot battery has a radar set, a command center, an electric power plant and eight boxy ''launching stations,'' which look like large freight containers, each with four missiles. All the equipment rides on vehicles or trailers.  The core of the system is called ''phased-array'' radar - the latest radar, in which the antenna stands still while the electronic signals move in high-speed bursts.  The radar first detects the incoming Scuds, then ''tracks'' them - plots their course - and finally guides the Patriots to the Scuds. The radar performs the tasks of nine types of radar of the oldNikeHercules and Hawk missile batteries.  The solid-fuel Patriot is 17.5 feet long and 16 inches in diameter. In theory, even a near-miss with its 200-pound fragmentation warhead will kill a Scud. But for all practical purposes, the speeds involved demand a direct hit.  That makes timing critical, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham of High Frontier, a private group that pushes Star Wars.  ''You've got only a couple of minutes,'' Graham said, to detect and track the Scuds and fire the Patriots. Even with their range of more than 40 miles, the Patriots destroy the Scuds only 2 to 4 seconds before the Scuds would otherwise hit.  Now, luck is critical.  The Patriot has a limited ''footprint'' - the area it can defend.  And just as the Patriot's area is limited, so is its ability to cope with mass waves of missiles.  Although the radar is said to be able to track 100 targets at a time, Graham warned that the number that can be actually shot at is limited.  ''Each battery has eight launchers with four missiles each, so that's 16 targets,'' Graham said, assuming two Patriots for each Scud.  Before the war, the Army had four Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia. Graham said he had not heard of any more being sent. But he says that given the experience of recent days, more might be.  Few people say the Patriot fulfills the promise of Star Wars. An Iraqi Scud is a far easier target than a Soviet intercontinental missile with maneuverable warheads.",0.099806763285,0.448174603175,654 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"June 2, 1991, Sunday",152 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;If Bo Jackson's sporting career is over, that would make him the last of the great baseball stars, and even he didn't exactly qualify. He was a hybrid, a baseball-football freak whose like we hadn't seen since Jim Thorpe. And it took a shoe commercial to make him really famous anyway.  Where are the great baseball stars? I mean real stars, Ruthian stars, where-have-you-gone-Joe-DiMaggio stars? Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Hammerin' Hank stars?  As far as I can tell, there aren't any, even though baseball, as a game, is bigger, grander, more popular than ever, or haven't you tried pricing baseball cards lately? And even though we live in an era where anyone - picture your name here - can be a celebrity.  It isn't as if the games we play aren't yielding heroes. Michael Jordan is the only man in America whose popularity rivals Stormin' Norman (take note: he drinks Diet Pepsi) Schwarzkopf. He is On-The-Air Jordan. Talk about hang time, Jordan has true staying power, from your shoes to your breakfast table to your soft drink to who knows where it will end. It doesn't stop with Jordan, either. Old people get Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Young people get Boris Becker and John McEnroe. Magic Johnson, Mr. Robinson. And Joe Montana, he's everywhere now. Even Mike Tyson. Greg Lemond - who rides a bicycle - gets Taco Bell. Basketball, football, boxing, cycling, golf, tennis.  Baseball, anyone?  Maybe it's the criteria we set for stardom these days.&nbsp;In the modern era, stardom has come to mean endorsements, commercials, TV time.Nikemade Bo; Bo didn't makeNike. Nikedid as much for Bo as Miller Lite did for Marv Throneberry. It's all an advertising game.  Let's take the case of David Robinson, who is a fine basketball player but no better than Patrick Ewing or Hakeem Olajuwon. Somebody in advertising picked out Robinson, who is bright and articulate, but the ad boys didn't trade on that, either. They made Robinson into the stereotypical 7-foot mean guy whose path you had better cross only with caution, in comic juxtaposition with the numbing calmness of Mr. Rogers. It's a media creation, and Mr.  Robinson, although he performs in a small market, is now a media star.  Why didn't somebody pick Rickey Henderson instead?  There is one easy explanation, and that's shoes. Basketball players wear shoes that people buy by the millions, pumping up the volume. People don't kick back in cleats, if only for safety reasons. The shoe industry and the National Basketball Association have fed nicely on each other in classic economic symbiosis, and they've both grown apace. And there's the crossover effect. Minute Maid is coming out with a commercial starring Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins and Ewing, who are hot because basketball is hot becauseNikecommercials are hot.  But Boomer Esiason just got a Reebok commercial. Why not Don Mattingly? Why not Eric Davis? Why not Ryne Sandberg? Why not Dwight Gooden?  Nolan Ryan is getting work these days, but, gosh, is there a better story anywhere in sports? This guy is a biological phenomenon who, by any logic, ought to be a megastar - but who isn't, at least on Madison Avenue.  Even the experts are stumped. If the time is ripe for anti-heroes - McEnroe, Jim McMahon, Brian Bosworth, Charles Barkley - why not Jose Canseco, who has fame, personality and all the bad, bad boy you could ask for? Go figure.  There are actually more stars, in the old sense, in baseball than in any other sport. There are names that people who follow baseball know. But as it was explained to me, baseball, in advertising jargon, is an ''old reliable brand'' and therefore possesses limited sex appeal. And it's a regional brand.  Cal Ripken is big in Baltimore, Andre Dawson in Chicago and Michael Jordan everywhere.  But could there be more to it? Has baseball somehow become a faceless sport? Or is it that the real heroes, say Pete Rose, have shown themselves to be flawed?",0.104821339862,0.514841920375,658 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"June 27, 1991, Thursday",153 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;NEON LACES BLUR into streams of color as boys skate their way toward the goal.Hockey sticks fly around neon laces and a neon puck while the otherwise all-black skates scream along equally black asphalt pavement.  On this particular day, there are enough of these neon-and-black skates, plus baseball caps, full-cut shorts and T-shirts to make them all look like parts of an unofficial uniform on St. Louis' active roller-hockey scene.  Other kids at St. Peter's Catholic school parking lot in Kirkwood could care less about fashion, however.  Skating alongside boys wearing the new, loose-fitting nylon shorts by Umbro - topped sometimes with Umbro orNikeT-shirts - are boys wearing other, longer shorts or well-worn jeans. These youths, and many adults, who've begun lacing up the trademarked Roller Blades plus other brands of in-line skates - also referred to generically as ''roller blades'' - are doing so for the sheer fun of speeding along on the sets of parallel wheels, if not playing a game or getting an aerobic workout in them.  But the fact that blading is a popular and growing sport means that retailers of sporting goods are building up, and selling, their supplies of related accessories.  ''The Umbro name itself,'' says Omni Sports' buyer Larry Brandenberg, ''is like Polo to the kids. It's a real status thing. It's been popular because of the shorts and now, all of a sudden, because of the street hockey. I think the Blues had an impact on it,'' he says of the St. Louis ice-hockey team's success this season.&nbsp;''And now, roller hockey is just as hot, if not hotter, than when the Blues were playing.'' Rick Remmy, manager of the Alpine Shop, reports a 200 percent increase in orders for Roller Blades and other in-line skates since the store began carrying them some six years ago. He added that adult skaters are going for clothing with the roominess that they find in new Patagonia ''baggy'' shorts or in a line of Quicksilver sporting shorts and tops.  ''Anything we get in, we can't keep in stock,'' says John Callahan, merchandise coordinator of footwear for Casey's Sport/Gart Bros. stores.  ''It's definitely our best-selling item, the blades and everything surrounded with it.'' And at Outdoors Inc., where the focus traditionally has been on other sports, blading has generated enough demand to warrant stocking a full inventory of skates this year, says store manager Rick Washburn. Before, blades were special-ordered. And Washburn says Columbia's full-cut ''gorge'' shorts, plus the Patagonia baggy shorts, are popular options for skaters.  On the St. Peter's school lot, clothing also needs to have ample room for movement.  Of his Umbros, says sixth-grader Mike Molick, ''Everybody likes to wear them because they're loose and because everybody wears them.'' But, he adds, ''We just wear any kind of thing you want to wear.'' ''Do you consider that you're making a fashion statement?'' asks an adult, stepping into the swarm of some 30 boys and their hockey gear.  ''No,'' several answer at once.  ''Then why all the Umbros andNikes?'' Already, it's become clear from talking with a few of the players that they've had to work at home or in the neighborhood to make some money to pay for their skating gear.  ''If you have tight-fitting shorts,'' a young blader says simply, ''you won't be able to move fast enough.'' The outfits worn by blading adults may be even more trendy.  Take the stuff that Dr. Tom Switzer, a dentist from the Central West End, had on the other day as he skated briskly on the bicycle path near Lindell Boulevard in Forest Park.  Switzer wore neon green, full-cutNikeshorts and a matching greenNikeT-shirt; a neon pink baseball cap; royal blue knee pads; red elbow pads; brown wrist protectors for ''my moneymakers'' he says of his wrists and hands - ''If I broke these, I'd be out of business''; a headset radio tucked into a hem-line pocket of the shorts; black gloves; blue ski poles, with baskets removed for city blading; and, of course, roller blades with neon pink laces.  Of his bright colors, Switzer said, ''That just happens to be the style now. But nine times out of 10, being a bachelor, I'll take what's next in the drawer until I get down to the bottom and then take it all to the laundry.'' Blading in the summer, he said, keeps his snow-skiing muscles fit. He started the skating three years ago, going vigorously around the park's six-mile bike path at least three times a week. ''When I started, I would almost never see another person'' on the in-line skates. ''This year there's been a quantum leap.'' The 46-year-old dentist emphasized the importance of careful skating and some protective clothing. He fell on the debris-strewn Forest Park path after a storm not too long ago and bruised a rib. Crowded conditions on the path, with cyclists, runners, bladers, p ower walkers, even strollers, sharing the space also can create hazardous conditions, he said.  Jim Gleason, 20, who was blading nearby in shorts, T-shirt and headband in various shades of pink, plus darker pink hues on belt bag and gloves, was trying out a freshly healed hand he had broken while skating elsewhere.  A sales associate at Target, Gleason occasionally comes to Forest Park from Des Peres, where he lives, to work out and execute some expert, free-style skating moves. More often, he blades in parking lots near his home.  ''Gloves,'' Gleason said, ''probably are the most important thing to wear,'' especially because falling forward often means landing on a wrist or hand, he said. ''I tried to wear knee pads,'' Gleason added, ''but they got in the way.'' Otherwise, he prefers an outfit of loose-fitting shorts, sometimes with another pair of stretchy spandex shorts underneath, and ''always a headband,'' Gleason said, to keep the sweat out of his eyes.  Two other Forest Park skaters that day were happily out of style and also short one pair of skates. Bryan Reckamp, 14, and Luke Politte, 15, both of University City, wore their long, baggy cotton bermudas and T-shirts as they shared a single pair of skates. A tennis shoe apiece finished their outfits and helped them execute skate-board like tandem maneuvers on the blades.  Neither wore pads or other protective gear.  With the exception of a pair of goggles over at the St. Peter's School lot, no other protective gear was to be found, except on two well-padded goalies.  Says Remmy, of the Alpine Shop and an active blader himself, ''If my kid was playing roller hockey, I'd put a helmet with a mask on him . . . hockey gloves, knee pads and elbow pads. . . . Probably the most important thing to say is that there are not enough people with protective gear.'' And, indeed, at St. Peter's, just as a game was heating up, a puck hit Brent Hoeman's stick and traveled upward, cutting him just above his right eyebrow. The cut eventually took eight stitches.  The school was closed that day for a religious holiday, but principal Maureen Jones happened to be there. She applied ice to the cut and called Hoeman's grandmother.  Boys rallied around Hoeman, asking him how he felt.  ''This is only the third incident,'' one boy said of roller-hockey injuries there. ''We don't try to hurt anybody.'' ''He's had a bad week,'' another chimed in.  ''Did you see Brent's cut?'' asked another, eyes widening. ''Big time.'' A check with several area hospital s turned up few reported injuries from roller blading. No such injuries were cited at St. Joseph Hospital of Kirkwood, for instance. And at Barnes Hospital, media coordinator David Trousdale said an emergency-room spokesman reported seeing ''occasional very minor injuries of abrasions and lacerations due to falls'' from the in-line skates, ''which can be difficult to stop.'' St. Louis Children's Hospital's spokesman Dave Welborn said, ''We really haven't seen an increase...of kids injured on roller blades.'' But, he said the hospital's director of emergency services ''definitely recommends pads for elbows and knees, plus helmets.''",0.0646830226398,0.440154039337,1338 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"July 24, 1991, Wednesday",154 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Voters in the Meramec Valley School District will be asked on June 4 to increase the district's tax rate by 48 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation.  The money would be used for operating expenses and to pay for salary increases for teachers, said Superintendent Edward Hillhouse.&nbsp;The proposal needs a simple majority to pass. The district is mainly in eastern Franklin County, with small parts in St. Louis and Jefferson counties.  The district's tax rate last year was $2.23. If passed, the increase would add $45.60 to the school tax bill of the owner of a house worth $50,000.  Hillhouse said the increase is needed to hire two teachers at Coleman school and a part-time kindergarten teacher atNikeSchool.  The district also wants to install a computer lab at Robertsville School and to buy new reading series for pupils in kindergarten through third grade.  Hillhouse said the district is considering a bid of $69,000 for the series from Houghten and Mifflin Inc.  Some of the money would be used for teacher salary increases. Teachers will not be getting a raise in the next school year, Hillhouse said.  The district also wants to consider expanding counseling services, he said.  Hillhouse said the district's last operating tax increase occurred 17 years ago. In that time, voters have approved two bond issues, one seven years ago for $3 million and the other three years ago for $3.1 million. Hillhouse said that money went to build Truman School andNikeSchool and for renovations at existing schools.  Hillhouse said each school has been promoting the tax proposal.

"&nbsp;DANA BRAET is a good sport. Winter or summer, weekday or holiday, he spends atleast an hour running, cycling or hiking around Forest Park, the Katy Trail or Chubb Trail near Lone Elk Park. He also tries to find time for a little skiing or snowboarding on trips to a previous home in Boulder, Colo.  And he's certified as a full-time sports-massage therapist, working with, among other clients, the athletes of the 1990 Goodwill Games.  All of this is to say that Braet seemed like a natural choice when StyleWest went looking for someone knowledgeable to model - even give unofficial comments on - some of the best of new winter sporting clothes.  And there are a lot of them on the market right now.  They are as technical as they are stylish and colorful.  Trademarked names for the fabrics might overwhelm a shopper looking, for the first time, for ''dry warmth,'' as the sports-minded retailers call properties in Gore-Tex, Entrant, Silmond, Thermax, Therma Fleece, Polarplus, Polartec, Supplex, Capilene, Synchilla, Hydrofil, H2No Storm and Thinsulate, to name a few. Many of these fabrics are designed either to ''wick'' chilling moisture away from the skin or to transmit the moisture beyond to the outer layer of clothing, while keeping body heat in.  They make up a maze of new wintertime athletic apparel. But they also are features in clothing for anyone wanting to stay warm, not just the athletes among us. And this maze can be navigated with a little bit of help.&nbsp;Here, for instance, is a closer look at five outfits worn by Braet. Retailers also provided some details.  Because mountain biking is one of his favorite sports, Braet tried on two sets of clothes suitable for cycling, on- and off-trail.  It should be said, at the outset, that his preference is for simple tights and top of stretchy Lycra - perhaps covering a layer of wicking underwear in cold weather - and all under a simple, lightweight shell.  So it wasn't a surprise that he liked the stretch elements in Pearl Izumi's new lightweight Therma Fleece tights - made of a Lycra woven with a fleeced surface inside. A jersey on top was of Thermasoft - a wind-resistant nylon fabric with fleece inner layer - and both were worn under a lightweight Pearl Izumi jacket of Silmond, a water-resistant fabric made of micro-filaments.  ''It's a new trend in mountain biking to have your micro-fiber shell,'' said Debbie Buzzotta, a buyer for Tourin g Cyclist shops, ''because you ride through a lot of wet grass and muddy conditions. So having something that repels water is very important.'' Braet said the pieces provided ''something that's comfortable, that stretches where you need it to stretch. How it fits your body is important, with nothing binding.'' The gloves, meanwhile, were lined with Thinsulate - a thin-fleeced fabric - and covered with stretch-Entrant, a treated polyester for water resistance but breathability.  A second cycling outfit was designed for much more difficult winter weather. Also by Pearl Izumi, it was of bright yellow, non-stretch Entrant in a jacket over pants, with knees inset with stretch material. The outfit is from what's called a ''foul weather collection,'' said Buzzotta. Braet found them to be a good fit and comfortable to stand around in on this particularly cold winter day. But he said that unlike ''another half of the population who will say, 'this is just right,' it has to be real cold before I wear Gore-tex'' or, in this case, the similar fabric of Entrant. Braet said he has a metabolism that makes working out in water-repellent pieces unbearably hot.  He added that he is grateful, however, for all of these technical breakthroughs in fibers and treated fabrics. Years ago, when ''this kind of stuff just didn't exist, you had to wear lots of heavier layers. Before Lycra, I just wore two layers of polypropylene'' he said, referring to a first synthetic treatment used in long underwear, ''and a pair of jeans.'' A helmet is imperative in any kind of cycling, he added. One that's tested and approved by the Snell laboratories is preferable, Buzzotta said.  ''Always wear a helmet,'' Braet emphasized. ''I've only ridden without one when it's just so darn cold that I've had to wear a number of layers on my head, and a helmet just wouldn't fit. If it's too cold to wear your helmet,'' he said, ''then you don't need to ride.'' Buzzotta also stressed the importance of ''the right pair of shoes, especially on a mountain bike. The shoe has to slip into a toe clip or have a cleat on bottom to hook into pedals,'' she said. ''It also has to have some tread, like a hiking shoe, for walking (with a bike) and getting it up hills.'' For winter hiking without a bike, Braet tried on Patagonia's bright-red, unlined ''guide shell'' made of an H2No Storm coating on nylon, from Outdoors Inc. ''It's not as breathable as Gore-Tex,'' said Rick Washburn, manager at Outdoors, ''but rather than being a membrane that Gore-Tex is, it's a coating on nylon that is highly water resistant. And it has a mesh liner to keep nylon away from the skin.'' Wasburn recommended wearing Patagonia's lightweight Capilene underwear, to wick away any moisture from a strenuous, cold-weather hike, and also Patagonia's shell of fleecy Synchilla, between the under- and outerwear.  Another Patagonia item, a ''duck bill'' cap from Outdoors Inc., was a runaway favorite of Braet's. Made of fleece in the shape of a baseball cap - with fleecy ear flaps to wear down or tuck inside - the cap, said Braet, was ''excellent. That one could be worn running, or cycling underneath the helmet.  I was warm in that.'' Said Washburn, ''The way old stocking-style caps are worn, half the ear is exposed all the time. Ear flaps allow you to cover ears all the way.'' The cap is a relatively new style and represents ''the first time Patagonia used the fleece in this particular way.'' For yet another favorite sport - running - Braet usually wears the Lycra tights, again, and ''some kind of Lycra top, with a shell, pretty much all year. The most I would add is maybe another layer on the fingers and maybe another layer on the pants, if it's real windy.'' Also from Patagonia, at Backwoods, came something a little different.  It is a new, stretch Synchilla - Patagonia's fleecy-warm polyester fabric which this year comes in a lighter, 7.5-ounce-per-yard weight, with a small percentage of stretch fiber woven in. Regular Synchilla is 11 ounces per yard and used in some of the heavier pullovers and jackets, already mentioned.  Braet wore the stretch version as tights and a top under a nylon shell.  ''The stretch Synchilla was really comfortable,'' said Braet, after trying a brief running workout in the two pieces, plus light nylon jacket. ''At first I didn't like it. I just thought it looked like pajamas or something. As soon as I got it on, it was just part of you. It had no binding quality.'' On his feet were another new item,Nike'sAir Mowabb boots, designed for the ''cross training'' purposes of mountain bikers, hikers and trail runners.  He liked those, too. And Patagonia's lightweight Capilene glove liners were just right for running, he said. An ''expedition weight'' of the Capilene liners also came from Outdoors Inc. and would be good for colder days, he said.  Another crossover of merchandise came from a source called Earth Monster - a company making winter-sports headbands and hats out of Ozark, Mo.  An Earth Monster headband - with et hnic-look cotton weavings on the outside, warming synthetic fabric inside - came from Backwoods.  The Alpine Shop had funky Earth Monster berets and hats for snowboarding, the final sport Braet was outfitted for.  Said Lisa Kircher, a buyer for the Alpine Shop, ''Snowboarding is probably the hottest thing in Alpine skiing. 'Riding the board,' it's called, and it's very elegant and graceful looking.'' Meanwhile the clothes for those who do snowboard - mostly young men in their teens, 20s and into their 30s - look less elegant, more like surfing gear, mountain style.  Braet wore Burton's knee-padded pants, of a breathable, water-resistant nylon-like black fabric, under a wildly decorated Burton ''shell jacket'' pullover, plus a vest. The shell and pants ''have a mesh lining, a wicking material,'' Kircher said, ''to wick moisture away. It's a very active sport.'' Patagonia's Capilene long underwear, she added, is what ''we think is the best to wear'' underneath the snowboarding clothes. ''And in extreme conditions, we would not use cotton as the second layer. We'd use, preferably, another wicking layer, Capilene or something not cotton. Cotton probably feels best to people next to the skin, but it holds moisture and doesn't transport it in cold weather.'' Braet, indeed, got a little cold while waiting to model the snowboarding outfit. But he said that when he changed clothes, he'd left on only his cotton T-shirt and black cycling shorts as protection underneath. ''I was cold, too, because I wasn't working out,'' said the man who's marathoned with the best in Colorado, as well as St. Louis. And the temperature was edging down into the teens from a high of 28 that day. The funky clothes, meanwhile, looked just right, he said, and ''would be comfortable for that sport.''",0.158513708514,0.544789968683,1545 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"March 8, 1991",156 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Add this to the things that Bo knows: frustration.It's a first for all-everything Bo Jackson, who has built a spectacular career through football and baseball, plus megabucks product endorsements and a best-selling autobiography - all with an image of versatile indomitability.Bo knows, Bo shows, Bo blows away obstacles with talent and iron will.Every obstacle, that is, except one - a hip injury that in mid-January seemed a temporary setback but appeared serious enough Monday to cost him at least one of his multimillion-dollar hobbies.&nbsp;At least for now.Jackson, 28, suffered cartilage damage in the joint of his left hip Jan. 13 playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in the NFL playoffs. On Monday, the Kansas City Royals, who agreed last month to pay him $ 2.375 million this year, became convinced he wouldn't be able to play baseball at least this season. Facing a deadline today to get out of the deal for one-sixth of that amount, the Royals released their former All-Star outfielder.''It's tragic that this happened,'' says Royals General Manager Herk Robinson, suggesting that if Jackson had used his off-seasons to tune baseball skills instead of playing pro football, he might have been ''the greatest player to wear our uniform.''But don't write the farewell tribute just yet, says Jackson: ''Don't count me out.''Says Richard Woods, Jackson's lawyer: ''All that stuff about a career- ending injury is a crock. Bo's career is not over. We expect him to play this year. And if not this year, next year.''The 25 other major-league teams have until Friday afternoon to claim rights to Jackson - and assume responsibility for his salary - or he will be free to negotiate a new deal with any team.The Royals had made no secret of their annoyance at Bo's insistence on playing football. And Bo has taken his swings at Royals management. In Bo Knows Bo, the book he wrote last year with Dick Schaap, Jackson hinted he'd just as soon play elsewhere.Under pressure in the last few days to talk to reporters, Jackson's frustration has been obvious. He cursed at a Kansas City photographer Monday morning in the Orlando, Fla., airport.Yet, says Woods, ''when Bo was told the news (of his release), it put a big smile on his face. We are extremely pleased with what's going on.''Woods argues that Jackson's Birmingham, Ala., doctor, Jim Andrews, disagrees with the Royals' pessimistic view of Bo's future: ''Jim Andrews is confident that Bo will be playing baseball again.''But this year? And what about football? Endorsements? And what would it be like for Jackson to sit out a season for the first time in his life?Some tentative answers:- Football. ''It's not something that's on his mind right now,'' says Woods. ''If he plays too soon, it could cause permanent injury. But there's no question, subject to what the doctor says, that Bo's heart is in putting on the cleats and pads and playing football again. It could well be that he'll sit out the baseball season and play a full season of football.''Even if his injury prevents him from playing with the Raiders next season, he'll earn $ 1.1 million plus another $ 516,000 in bonuses because his contract is guaranteed.- Off the field. Bo is as famous for his ''Bo knows'' commercials forNikeshoes as for his exploits on the football and baseball fields.''Obviously, Bo's injury may have an impact'' onNike'sschedule for future commercials, says spokeswoman Liz Dolan. ''So, like other people, we're waiting to see him get well.''Dolan insistsNikewill stand by Jackson. ''We have never canceled a contract with an athlete due to an injury. Unfortunately, injury is part of sports, and we understand that.''But the impact on Jackson's marketability if he's out for a season or longer is another question.''I hope Bo is so big that his posters would continue to sell, but we have to be realistic,'' says Aaron Pepper of Starline, which makes and sells sports posters. Often, he says, ''it's out of sight, out of mind.''Joe Timmerman of Sports Impressions, a company that makes and sells miniature figurines of athletes, says if Jackson is out of action for a prolonged period, ''there's no doubt it's going to hurt him.''Of course, using active players as product models is ''like playing the stock market or riding a wave,'' says Timmerman.If the public starts to cool on Bo, so will advertisers, says Timmerman. And the superstar might find companies less willing to indulge his scheduling demands.''He does what he wants to do when he wants to do it,'' says Timmerman. ''That's OK when you're a phenomenon. It's not OK if you're not. The public is so fickle.''Cramer Products in Gardner, Kan., sent out a memo Monday to its sales staff to head off worries over how its new sports-medicine line, Bo Med pads and braces, would be affected by Jackson's injury.''Bo Jackson will continue to be the driving force behind the Bo Med line, regardless of the severity of his injury, regardless of his future as an athlete,'' wrote Cramer president Mike Vineyard. ''If anything, the concept of 'Bo knows sports medicine' will be even more credible than in the past.''- His attitude. There's no hiding Jackson's frustration at sitting on the sidelines. He told reporters when he announced his intention to play two pro sports that he would only get in trouble if he had all that spare time in the baseball off-season.Although injuries have plagued Jackson since his days at Auburn University, seldom have they kept him out of action for long. The hip injury has been different, requiring long hours of therapy that seems to have had little effect.Royals manager John Wathan made an effort to talk to Jackson recently ''because I heard from some of the guys that he was down. He was tired of therapy and having nothing happening. He was getting tired of seeing everybody play (in spring training) and he couldn't. He genuinely missed playing baseball.''People forget that he's a human being. They don't realize he has feelings. He's sensitive and feeling. He's had to have a bulletproof vest just to survive the people that hound him.''This is a tough time for an athlete.''Still, Jackson has made a habit of turning adversity to his favor. And he has his own ideas of what rehabilitation will require.Woods says that when he read the details of his release, Jackson said, ''You mean I don't have to be with the team? I can hunt and fish all summer.''&nbsp;Contributing: Carol Herwig, Hal Bodley, Mel Antonen, Gordon Forbes and Jerry BonkowskiTEXT OF GRAPHICBaseball1990: $ 1 million1991: $ 395,000Football1990: $ 960,900, plus $ 516,000 in bonuses1991: $ 1,101,500, plus $ 516,000 in bonuses&nbsp;Nikeendorsements$ 2 million-$ 4 million annuallySource: USA TODAY research",0.0421797865877,0.430432378294,1139 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"March 31, 1991, SUNDAY, THREE STAR Edition",158 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"TheNike/ABCD Basketball Camp, the swoosh-stripe fashion show that doubles as a showcase for the USA's most dazzling high school boys basketball talent, concluded last week.Participants hailed it as one of the best ever. Although the camp stresses academics, featuring five hours of classwork daily, its dribbles might be numbered.A controversial piece of legislation from the National Association of Basketball Coaches is aimed at reining in summer camps.&nbsp;The NABC says the current system fails in several areas:- It allows third parties to exert influence over prospects in recruiting or act as middlemen between players and college coaches.- It forces coaches to crisscross the country for all of July to put in appearances watching prospects; such appearances are believed to be essential in wooing recruits.That runs at odds with cost-cutting measures the NCAA is trying to enforce.''It's an area that's totally unregulated,'' said University of Southern California coach George Raveling, chairman of the NABC Recruiting Committee.The committee recommends that the NCAA start regulating. Its suggestion: nine NCAA-sponsored regional camps.The recommendation goes before the NCAA Council July 31. If it passes, it will be forwarded to the NCAA convention in January, where university presidents will vote on it as a two-year pilot program to be implemented in summer 1993.''I think it has a real good chance of passing,'' said Rick Evrard, NCAA director of legislative services.According to the NABC plan, only high school seniors-to-be (not other underclassmen) would be invited to its camps, at a cost of $ 75, and only high school coaches would work at the camps.Most important, these would be the only camps college coaches are permitted to attend, which presumably would put talent shows likeNikein the shoebox.''I think it's ludicrous,'' saidNikecoordinator Sonny Vaccaro, the man who outfits his 120 campers in shoes, shirts and shorts - and the man whom some call the most powerful in college basketball because of his shoe deals with dozens of the game's top coaches.''I think it's blind. And the reasons aren't good enough for me to believe that what they're trying to do is for the best interests of the kids.''Raveling stressed he is merely the chairman of the NABC's Recruiting Committee, not a lone firebrand.''I'm interested in who these people are who think it's a slim chance,'' he said. ''They're certainly not the people who vote on it. ... A lot of coaches want to demonstrate to adminstrators they're on the same page.''Raveling said he has been banned from three camps for his advocacy of a new summer system.The only camp Raveling would name that he said has banned him is Dave Krider's All-American camp in Cincinnati. Krider also is sports editor for the La Porte (Ind.) Herald-Argus and picks all-USA teams for USA TODAY.Raveling said players are saying they feel pressured to attend Krider's camp in order to boost chances of being all-USA.''We don't promise kids anything,'' Krider said. ''I have never, ever told kids anything as far as my position at USA TODAY helping them in any way.''Krider's camp made its debut last year. He and partner Bobby Kortsen charged coaches $ 200 for Kortsen's scouting service - which they had to buy in order to gain access to floor seating at the University of Cincinnati's Shoemaker Center.Krider, who will charge only $ 15 this year, claims some schools spend more than $ 20,000 on recruiting, ''so how much is $ 200 really?'' Krider also alleges that at their camps, Bill Cronauer (BC Camp) and Howard Garfinkel (Five Star) have sold private information on prospects. Garfinkel could not be reached, but Cronauer denies the charge.The divisiveness among camps, Raveling said, keeps them from presenting a united front to discuss the issue with the NABC.''Everyone is pointing his finger at the other guy,'' he said. ''There's a need for regulation. You can't even get five of them in the same room to arbitrate.''Several college coaches scouting Vaccaro's camp had reservations about the new proposal.''It's mixed, I think,'' Georgetown's John Thompson said of the coaches' reaction. ''I think a lot of guys are for it because of what they perceive it to be: They perceive it to be something where the NCAA will take total supervision and there will be no influences at all.''. ... But is the NCAA capable of administering a camp? Let's stop and think about that. They can't even administer enforcement services; they don't have enough people. Where's the (camp) staff going to come from? Where's the funding going to come from?''",0.141020854146,0.495683066933,778 words,Anderson signs to representNike,"November 28, 1991, THURSDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",161 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"The trainers which adorn the feet of athletes and fashion-conscious youth are truly space-age. Sue Moore reportsLegions of high-technology trainers are pounding urban pavements, their tongues hanging out. To traditionalists the conspicuous white glare of the chunky new sports shoes makes them seem as if they have landed from outer space. Appearances are not entirely deceptive. A closer look at the complicated internal workings of the trainers on display in the Science Museum's ''Running on Air'' exhibition reveals that the design of these fashionable shock absorbers for feet has its origins in space travel technology.&nbsp;The exhibition traces the history of the air-cushioning system in theNikecompany's sports shoes, which is based on an idea originally developed by an aerospace engineer, Frank Rudy. Studying the effects of the pressurised gas bags that let lunar modules land safely, Mr Rudy saw an alternative use for the concept. It was transposed to ski boots in the early Seventies, proved useful in ice hockey skates and basketball boots, and eventually, after Mr Rudy approachedNikewith the idea, it was designed into the 1979 Tailwind, the firstNikeshoe to use air-cushioning to support a foot. Subsequent models have included inflatable collars, and cutaway windows in the soles.These high-technology developments are far removed from the customised clodhoppers which are the ancestors of today's lightweight sports shoes. Well into the late 19th century, rugby players and footballers tramped about the playing fields in hobnailed workboots. There was no such thing as a specifically designed sports shoe in Britain until 1876, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company produced a lightweight canvas croquet shoe with a vulcanised rubber soul. It swiftly earned the nickname ''plimsoll'', because the join between upper and sole resembled the loading lines painted on ships' hulls then being advocated by Samuel Plimsoll. The basic shape of the plimsoll remains a design classic, current in contemporary sneakers and deck shoes.Vulcanised rubber still makes regular appearances in the soles of modern sports shoes, but in recent years the proliferation of new polyurethanes, foams and nylons has given shoe designers an impressive range of ingredients from which to develop comfortabl and supportive trainers. Although uppers come in eye-catching colours and complicated fretwork connecting up to 30 separate pieces, the most innovative design technology is used to construct the soles. The 6ft models on show at the Science Museum reveal howNike's''air support'' soles are put together, and demonstrate the uses of each kind of material. Energetic visitors can give a hammering to a variety of different soles, imitating the rigorous testing of new designs at the company's sports research laboratory in Oregon.The technological and biomechanical expertise invested in new trainer design reflects the manufacturers' belief that their products are primarily sports shoes. Whether that claim remains strictly true today is debatable, but certainly in their first incarnation, the shoes were designed by athletes for athletes. The founder of Reebok, Joseph William Foster, was a keen amateur runner. In 1892, frustrated by the weighty footwear on the market, he designed and made one of the first pairs of specialised spiked running pumps for himself.Impressed by the design, fellow athletes in the Bolton Primrose Harriers running club put their orders in, and by the turn of the century Foster had set up the family business that later became Reebok International.During the first half of the 20th century, requests from athletes for perfect running shoes set ever more demanding briefs for designers. Extra weight was shed, and less very definitely meant more. In 1938, when the sprinter, C.B.Holmes, won the Commonwealth Games 220yd race, he wore a very special pair of Foster's shoes. Their rubber soles were so thin that each pair lasted for only one race. Holmes ran his way through three separate pairs of pumps in the heat, semi-final and final before winning the gold medal.Although the close connection between manufacturers and athletes continues, trainers are no longer elite sporting equipment. Twenty-five years ago, when New Balance produced the first wide-based running shoe designed on orthopaedic principles, it was available only through a special mail-order service to athletes. Now the designs which were originally intended to improve the speed and performance of serious athletes have gained highly marketable street credibility. Now New Balance shoes grace the feet of couch potatoes everywhere. They, and every other piece of technologically advanced sports footwear, are not just for the fit, but for the fashion conscious.Times Newspapers Ltd 1991''Running on Air'' is at the Science Museum, Exhibition Road, London SW7 (071-938 8181) from March 8 to May 10.

"&nbsp;Traditional court wear is being shoved aside for the wildest tennis fashions in decades.Say hello to bright neons and bold jewel tones.&quot;Fifteen years ago, whites were white but that's no longer the case,&quot; said Charles Zimmerman, customer service supervisor for Adidas Canada.&nbsp;Tennis wear is now anything but predictable.Traditional tennis skirts now come with lycra shorts sewn inside.  Or forget the skirt.  Lycra shorts are hip alone or under white tennis shorts.Or ditch the white shorts.  Tennis shorts now come in an array of denim.  There's washed denim, distressed denim in black, and various hues of blue.Bland tennis shirts have gotten an image boost.  Many come with zippers and in neon patterns.  Narrow cuts have been loosened up and some shirts come with a tail at the back.The biggest swing has been the shift away from white.  Industry leaders likeNikehave added Persian violet, clear turquoise, hot lime and neon teal to their summer collections.  Fall pushes the swing further with tennis blacks holding centre court, said Ruth Heaven, national apparel manager forNikeCanada.&quot;There's a move to the extreme since black has never been on the court before,&quot; said Heaven.  &quot;Black has always been the number one body color and outsells all other colors.  It's a easy sell because it's practical and you can mix it into other things.&quot;The break from bland has a lot to do with American tennis sensation Andre Agassi.  The fashion-forward dynamo is revolutionizing tennis wear with his penchant for flash, says Heaven.The sixth-ranked player created a stir at Wimbledon this year when he showed up in white.  Long known for his untraditional tennis garb, sports commentators were predicting he'd break tradition.With his long, dyed-blond hair, earring and funky tennis wear in bright colors like lime, Agassi is turning a staid game on its ear, said Dan Orman of Freeds.Players, whose own fashions tend to mirror their favorite stars, have been snapping up offbeat wear which often comes in matching shoes.&quot;Our zipper front tennis shirt has been one of our biggest sellers,&quot; said Heaven.Younger players love the look of Agassi-inspired tennis wear, said Heaven.&quot;Agassi may lose but he's liked by all the little girls and youth out there,&quot; she said.  &quot;He's a rebel andNike(which pays royalties to Agassi for wearingNikeclothing) likes it.  It's fun, agressive and different.&quot;While younger players favor the look, older player's don't.&quot;Adults hate the Agassi look,&quot; said Heaven.Most prefer classic tennis whites, she added.  So do many clubs which place restrictions on the amount of non-white players can wear.Color tends to mask or hide the ball, said Zimmerman.  9Distributed by the Southam News Network.",0.0888513513514,0.46981981982,157 words,NIKEINC.: FIRM AND L.A.

"&nbsp;The greying of jockdom is apparent all along Madison Avenue. At 39, Jimmy Connors is urging headache sufferers to &quot;Nupe it with Nuprin&quot; in television commercials and print advertisements created by J. Walter Thompson. Soon, BBDO Worldwide will add the tennis player to the roster of celebrities featured in Diet Pepsi's continuing &quot;You've got the right one baby, uh-huh!&quot; campaign.Connors is one of a teamful of sports stars with wrinkled brows beneath their headbands or receding hairlines under their helmets who are becoming more popular in advertising and as product endorsers.&nbsp;Advertising and sports executives attribute the growing appeal of aging athletes to their popularity with the baby-boom generation.In a new print ad by Wieden &amp; Kennedy forNikefootwear, Nolan Ryan, who is 44, appears alongside an inspirational text that insists: &quot;It's easier to keep going if you never stop. Just do it.&quot;And in another print ad just coming out, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York for Duracell Inc., a photograph of the Texas Rangers pitcher in action appears under the headline, &quot;He runs like he's on Duracell.&quot; These ads follow the pitcher's campaigns for Advil pain reliever, by Young &amp; Rubicam New York, and Wrangler jeans, by the Martin Agency Inc.Boxing's George Foreman, 42, co-stars with Bo Jackson in aNikespot also created by Wieden; when Jackson walks out of a singing-and-dancing spot-within-the-spot, Foreman eagerly fills in.And the golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez, 55, is featured in ads for Toyota, by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Inc., and the Nestle Crunch candy bar, by Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor.As the 76 million consumers born between 1946 and 1964 get older, &quot;they respond to the guys and girls who hang tough and defy the odds,&quot; Scott Bedbury,Nike'sadvertising director, said in a telephone interview from his office in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;The Nolan Ryan ad is all about still doing it after all these years.&quot;It is &quot;kind of a wonderful confluency of celebrities and audience identification with them,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, director of the Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago consulting firm.Connors was a natural for Nuprin, said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York, because the baby boomers &quot;are the people beginning to get the muscle aches.&quot; Thompson signed the tennis star before his surprising success at the U.S. Open, Patterson added, but rushed to create additional ads to capitalize on his march to the semifinals.Another reason older athletes are becoming so visible is that they have known track records, meaning there are likely to be fewer surprises for advertisers and agencies. By contrast, a younger star-in-the-making still adjusting to the glare of the limelight can be caught, Patterson said, &quot;in a peccadillo on the front page,&quot; jeopardizing his or her value as an endorser.For all their rising popularity, aging athletes have a lap or two to go before threatening the advertising livelihoods of the most successful limber-limbed, fuzzy-cheeked younger athletes.Michael Jordan makes an estimated $ 15 million to $ 20 million a year through more than a dozen deals with marketers including Quaker Oats (Gatorade), General Mills (Wheaties), General Motors (Chevrolet) andNike. And Magic Johnson earns about $ 12 million a year from advertisers including Pepsi-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nestle Crunch, which signed him Monday to be its principal pitchman, starting in January.And there is a danger that older athletes will diminish their worth to advertisers by risking what Lanktree called the &quot;humiliation and embarrassment&quot; of playing past their primes.Still, the phenomenon can continue to build, executives say, as athletes extend their playing careers by taking better care of themselves. One who could be in for big ad paydays nationally, Lanktree said, is Carlton Fisk, 43, catcher for the Chicago White Sox.&quot;In terms of baseball icons, you ain't seen nothing yet,&quot; Patterson agreed.",0.212954735323,0.486506037822,465 words,NIKEINC.: FIRM AND L.A.

"For college basketball fanatics, the four-day banquet of the NCAA tournament's first round leaves them fat and happy on the sofa, blissfully bloated from an all-consuming smorgasbord of backdoor screens and matchup zones. But now it's time for the Alka Seltzer, courtesy of Bill Moyers and public television.The reality of big-time college athletics -- fat-cat boosters, sleazy recruiters, academically deficient athletes, the television-fueled chase for the big money -- makes up the meat and potatoes of Moyers's 90-minute documentary &quot;Sports For Sale&quot; that will air tonight at 9 on WETA-TV-26. After that Moyers will moderate a live 30-minute panel discussion with members of the Knight Foundation's Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, the group that has been investigating college sports for the last year and a half and will release its recommendations earlier today. A 60-minute call-in show will follow, a grand total of three television no-commercial hours of what's really wrong with big-time sports in America today.&nbsp;Moyers and producer Howard Weinberg have spent the last year trying to find out, shooting major segments on troubled programs at Southern Methodist University and Iowa State and the summer meat market known as theNikebasketball recruiting camp in Princeton, N.J., with many stops elsewhere around the country.In truth, there's not much new ground broken here. Most of these stories have been done by every major news magazine and newspaper in America (some minor ones, too). There have been countless books on the subject, not to mention national study commissions that go back to the turn of the century when Theodore Roosevelt was so horrified by the alarming death rate in college football he implemented a federal investigation.Still, this is one tale that can't be told enough, even if most followers of college sports seem to care more about points-per-game than grade-points, and, by the way, tailgate at 11 in parking lot C, you bring the fried chicken, I'll buy the beer.Mostly, the show is about money, and how the economics of stadiums filled to capacity and athletic budgets driven by billion-dollar television contracts have turned college sports into something Moyers says &quot;they never were intended to be . . . . Television has made the difference. It's transported it from entertainment in the local community to entertainment for the whole country.&quot;It's also taken the student out of the student athlete. Consider this. When Andrew Gaze arrived from Australia to help Seton Hall get to the Final Four two years ago, he was taking courses in first aid, youth activities, creative movement and ethics. Four days after the tournament ended, Gaze said g'day and left school. Or how about Iowa running back Ronnie Harmon, who was eligible to play football despite grade-points of 1.62, 1.86 and 1.69 (on a 4.0 scale), with courses that included bowling, billiards and water colors.Kyle Carroll, a tackle on the SMU football team, talks about the reality of school and sports when he says, &quot;It's really hard to study. The first thing you want to do [after practice] is climb into bed, watch a little TV and turn off the lights. A normal student can take a nap. With us, the day is so filled, it's hard to get going at the end of the day because you're so exhausted . . . . It's not a game, it's a business.&quot;At theNikecamp in Princeton, 140 of the country's best high school players are in attendance, with luminaries such as John Thompson and Bobby Knight taking notes in the stands. Filmmaker Spike Lee (aNikespokesman) addresses the campers and advises them to ask recruiters &quot;how many of your players are graduating.&quot; Then he tells them, &quot;It's all about money.&quot;But most already know that. At the end of one segment, the camera focuses on an anonymous high school player who says: &quot;If a school makes it to the Final Four, the school gets millions and the players get nothing . . . . There's no such thing as a straight college playing by the rules . . . every college, every college, every college, slips up.&quot;Some of the numbers cited by Moyers should be required reading for every college sports fan in America. For example, 30 percent of Division I football and basketball players graduate; one quarter of thoseNikecamp players read below sixth grade level, including 10 who were functionally illiterate; Louisville's basketball program had a 16 percent graduation rate from 1981-90; none of the three seniors on Duke's 1990 Final Four team graduated with his class.Moyers provides no conclusions on camera, though in an interview he said he believes some problems would be solved by paying the players and conceding that big-time college sports are nothing more than minor league systems for the pros.&quot;That would at least end the hypocrisy,&quot; he said, adding that he's also looking forward to seeing what the Knight Commission has in mind today.

"For one brief shining moment today, the sun came out and put a spotlight on Centre Court as if to announce that the suspense was finally over. For 72 hours Wimbledon had waited. And now, with the crowd atwitter and dozens of telephoto lenses fixed on the players' entrance, Andre Agassi was ready to make his appearance.When he stepped onto the court at 3:45 this afternoon, the 21-year-old from Las Vegas wore his usual dangling earring and carried a Day-Glo orange racket and equipment bag. But as if to signal his reconciliation with tradition and with the rules of the All England Club, a white headband graced his wavy, died-blond locks and he wore a pristine white warm-up suit.&nbsp;There was polite applause. But a question lingered. What was he wearing underneath the warm-up? He kept on the suit for seven more minutes -- through the coin toss and a practice period -- tantalizing the crowd of 13,000 until the precise moment that his match against Canadian Grant Connell began.The outfit he unveiled more than complied with Wimbledon's &quot;predominantly white&quot; rule. To be exact, he wore white. All white. White shirt. White tennis shorts. White bicycle tights sewn into the shorts. White socks. White shoes. White trim. The only trace of color on his person was a small, blackNikelogo on his shirt and socks.&quot;Now you know how boring all white can be,&quot; joked Ian Hamilton, director of tennis sports marketing for theNikesporting goods company, which pays Agassi endorsement fees to wear audacious clothes and shoes. &quot;But Andre really likes it. It's a nice change.&quot;Agassi's outfit was only one reason that Day 4 of Wimbledon seemed a bit like theater of the absurd. Rain again washed out most of the matches, and vanished only long enough to allow Agassi and Connell to split their first two sets and the first two games of the third. Defending champion Stefan Edberg, who began his first-round match Tuesday after rain prevented any tennis Monday, played between showers this afternoon before he polished off Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Pete Sampras, the eighth-seeded player who also started Tuesday, had barely finished his 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory against Brazilian qualifier Danilo Marcelino when the clouds burst again. When play was halted, fourth-seeded Jim Courier led Frenchman Rodolphe Gilbert 5-4 in the first set, and 10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic was in the second set against England's Andrew Castle after winning the first in a tiebreaker. Meanwhile, Boris Becker, Ivan Lendl and Jimmy Connors continued their vigil in the locker room.In all, 52 matches have been played. The tournament is now approximately 200 matches behind schedule, causing men's doubles matches until the quarterfinals to be reduced to best-of-three sets.As has happened often these rainy four days, the tennis itself got the least attention. Agassi had skipped the tournament since playing here for the first time in 1987, in part because Wimbledon tradition conflicted with his need for self-expression.What he meant was that he didn't want to play on grass courts or conform to the predominantly white clothing rule. Usually he wears faded black denim shorts, lime green or hot lava bicycle tights, black-and-neon-colored shirts, and headbands and shoes to match. But that combination would offend the sensibilities of the officials here, who months before the tournament begins require all players to submit samples of the shoes and clothes they plan to wear.Six months ago, when it seemed likely he would play Wimbledon this year, Agassi and his designers began working on several outfits and submitted them to tournament officials. &quot;We showed them a lot of things and they rejected a lot of things,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;Everything.&quot;Ultimately, Agassi settled on a few designs, including the one he wore today, that wouldn't violate the club's rules. It was Agassi's idea to play his first match in all white, Hamilton said. &quot;He wanted to start off on the right foot here. That's what they would like him to do, so that's what he did.&quot;Agassi's outfit is a replica of what he wore this month at the French Open, except instead of bright mandarin and voltage purple -- all color names areNikeinventions -- it was white. The shorts were white denim, with white Lycra bicyle tights fitted in them, and he wore his trademark baggy shirt, not tucked in.Although Agassi's multicolored clothing line is a major success forNike, the company has no plans to market the all-white design. &quot;I think our customers would be disappointed if we did,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;They expect more from us than all-white.&quot;Agassi won't talk to reporters until his match is completed.

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEATTLE (Reuter) - A Seattle-based oceanographer believes that 80,000Nikeshoes will help explain the mysteries of trans-Pacific migration, the spread of oil spills and where bodies lost at sea will wash ashore.The researcher, Curtis Ebbesmeyer, has been studying the path of the drifting sneakers and sport shoes to learn more about how ocean currents work.The shoes - with a retail value of about $2.5 million - were accidentally dumped at sea in the Pacific Ocean by a freighter nearly 18 months ago and around 2,000 have washed ashore on West Coast beaches from Oregon to British Columbia.&nbsp;&quot;He's had a lot of interest in theseNikes,where they fell in and where they drifted,&quot; said Shannon Flotre, a colleague at Evans-Hamilton Inc., a Seattle-area oceanography firm in which Ebbesmeyer is a co-owner and oceanographer.Ebbesmeyer, who was not available for comment on his study, is a specialist on Puget Sound who also has expertise in statistics of drifting objects and keeps records on drifting portions of shipwrecks, icebergs and other matter.The data may help explain migration and anthropology of Pacific Island peoples and is frequently used in oil spill research and even in locating bodies lost overboard.The May, 1990, accident created the largest single drop of man-made drift objects in the North Pacific, surpassing 20,000 drift bottles dumped in the Pacific during the 1950s by a Canadian government research project.Rich Hastings, transport manager at Beaverton, Ore.-basedNikeInc., said the cargo was bound for Seattle from Korea and apparently was lost about 600 miles due south of Anchorage, Alaska.&quot;We do have an air cushioning system - some of the shoes had compressed air, which helped them float,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;I'm glad it can be at least some benefit. It's not littering the beaches because they're picked up as soon as they land.&quot;",0.0483516483516,0.393406593407,318 words,DriftingNikeshelp ocean research,"May 31, 1991, Friday, FINAL EDITION",189 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"If, for whatever cockeyed reason, you wanted to cast a classical musician alongside a professional athlete in a sneaker commercial, you might find a likely candidate or two. But you would find a host of unlikely ones, and among the very least plausible would be the pianist Rudolf Firkusny.Reserved and patrician in his bearing and in his playing, Mr. Firkusny, who lives in New York but was born in Napajedla, Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia), in 1912, is the epitome of old-world grace and gentility. &quot;I am not very much in the sport world,&quot; Mr. Firkusny said recently.&nbsp;Yet there he is on television with David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, playing Chopin and, uh, basketball in a commercial forNike.The idea came from James Riswold, an admirer of Mr. Firkusny's piano-playing and a copywriter for the advertising agency Weiden &amp; Kennedy, based in Portland, Ore. Mr. Riswold's work in otherNikecommercials has received wide acclaim.Though Mr. Firkusny took part only in the final day of shooting, he said the process of repeated takes was exhausting, much as in a recording session. &quot;For the first time I realized that it's not such an easy life to be a movie actor,&quot; he added. But there were rewards. He reported gleefully that he made one basket -- a feat, alas, not shown in the commercial.And now Mr. Firkusny revels in a new-found fame. &quot;Everybody saw it somehow,&quot; he said. &quot;My mailman told me he saw me on television.

"Operation PUSH, the Chicago civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, is going through a period of upheaval, struggling to reshape its identity in the face of financial troubles and the resignation of its executive director, the Rev. Tyrone Crider.PUSH leaders say they are reassessing strategy, stepping up fund raising and reorganizing the management of the 20-year-old organization, whose initials stand for People United to Serve Humanity.&nbsp;In January, faced with a deficit of several hundred thousand dollars, the PUSH board announced the layoff of all 12 staff workers. The group has since raised more than $100,000, and officials say they hope to raise $1 million in the next 12 months.The Rev. Henry Williamson, the new president and chief executive officer, said that PUSH had &quot;put out the immediate financial fires&quot; and that he hoped to rehire the workers soon. Most have continued as volunteers, he said.&nbsp;'Time to Take Inventory'Robert T. Starks, an associate professor of political science at Northeastern Illinois University who has followed PUSH, said: &quot;This is a critical period for the organization. Their major mission will remain the same, but it's a time to take inventory.&quot;Mr. Crider resigned this month, citing personal reasons, in what was widely seen as a response to PUSH's problems. The board then created a 20-member team to develop criteria for hiring a new director and reorganizing. PUSH has also begun a nationwide membership drive, with a goal of 100,000 new members this year.Although these moves seem to have been prompted by Mr. Crider's departure, many who have followed PUSH say the organization has floundered since 1989, when Mr. Jackson relinquished his leadership to move his legal residence to Washington.Mr. Jackson was in Chicago today to deliver an Easter sermon to more than 1,000 people at the Carter Temple Church, where Mr. Williamson is pastor. Referring to the Crucifixion, Mr. Jackson said, &quot;It wasn't the nails in His hands, painful as they were,&quot; but the fact that the people Jesus served had deserted Him. He urged the worshipers to contribute to PUSH.&nbsp;Jackson Seen as the KeyJames Compton, president of the Chicago Urban League, said, &quot;I tend to think that the key to the PUSH situation is the presence or lack of presence of Reverend Jackson.&quot;But some who are familiar with PUSH have said privately that it was losing influence even before Mr. Jackson left. Critics have charged that the group, which has long pressed for affirmative action and other efforts on behalf of minority workers and businesses, caters to middle-class blacks.Few prominent black Chicagoans will openly criticize PUSH. But a letter published in The Chicago Tribune last fall reflects the views of some detractors. It said, &quot;The fact is that most blacks under 30 think of PUSH, along with several other civil rights organizations, as dinosaurs.&quot;PUSH officials say such charges are untrue. They said PUSH's troubles rose from the downturn in the economy, which has heightened demands for the organization's services at the same time that contributions are down.&quot;We receive more than 150 calls each day,&quot; said the Rev. Willie Barrow, vice chairwoman of the PUSH board. Ms. Barrow said PUSH's financial troubles mirrored those of the corporate world.&nbsp;Public Relations FailuresBut some public relations failures have hurt PUSH. Most prominent was a boycott ofNikeInc., the athletic-shoe manufacturer, over its hiring practices. Several prominent blacks opposed the boycott, which was widely perceived as a failure whenNikeofficials refused to negotiate with PUSH.PUSH leaders argue that the boycott, which began in August, has forcedNike,as well as others in the athletic industry, to hire more blacks.Nikehas formed an advisory board to review the company's minority recruitment.",0.118765151515,0.387106060606,651 words,DriftingNikeshelp ocean research,"September 17, 1991, Tuesday, FINAL EDITION",191 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Hiking boots, those heavy, bomb-proof wedges of leather and rubber that were all the rage on college campuses 20 years ago, have gone through a metamorphosis. They have emerged in a flutter of colorful, high-tech designs that weigh almost nothing and cost anywhere from $50 to $250. In the last few years, the popularity of these boots and their high-tech cousins -- low-cut, hiking shoes -- has spread far beyond the traditional outdoor-enthusiast market.Behind the growth in this nearly $300 million market is the renewed interest in the environment and the shift -- especially among the aging baby-boom generation -- away from vigorous aerobics to the more family-friendly joys of walking, now the nation's leading form of exercise. And where baby boomers wander, the market follows.&nbsp;The key word is wander. This new breed of hiking-boot buyer is typically not the traditional backpacker who spends weeks camping in the wilderness. The growth in demand for these lightweight boots and shoes has come from individuals and families for whom the occasional day hike or weekend camping expedition (with the kids and plenty of insect repellent) is quite enough, thank you. It has also come from that category of shoppers who are city-bound but dress as if they lived in the backwoods of Maine.&quot;The market is growing and it's a very good mix of 50/50, men and women,&quot; said Joseph Guglielmetti, marketing director of Reebok International's outdoor unit in Stoughton, Mass.The growing demand for colorful high-tech boots and shoes is also attracting new entrants into the market. Traditional hiking-boot manufacturers and athletic-shoe manufacturers are meeting halfway between the mountain and the gym to produce hiking shoes with running-shoe technology.&quot;The market has blurred,&quot; said Robert McGee, footwear editor at Sports Style. &quot;Nikeand Reebok are bringing features from athletic shoes to outdoor boots and the outdoor people are moving from the hard core to the mainstream.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in VogueLighter Models Are Selling FastestAlthough the overall hiking-boot and shoe market is still a small slice of the $6.5 billion athletic and sport footwear market, sales are climbing. They jumped 17 percent last year to $295 million from $252 million in 1989, according to the National Sporting Goods Association. Sales have tripled since 1985. Because hiking is inexpensive and can be done close to home, said Pam Montgomery, marketing director at Outdoor Retailer, a trade magazine, the market is likely to remain robust.In its 1991 buying guide, Backpacker Magazine, which is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts, listed 24 manufacturers offering more than 250 styles of lightweight hiking boots and shoes, often with suggestive names like Adventure, Escape, Free Spirit and Rambler.The lightweight category, which now dominates the hiking-boot market, accounts for about 65 percent of all sales, according to Art Kenyon, president of Vasque, a unit of the Red Wing Shoe Company in Red Wing, Minn. Hiking shoes account for another 15 percent.Typically, the boots weigh two pounds or less and cost about $100. Low-cut trail shoes weigh about the same but are half the price. The more traditional medium- and heavy-weight boots -- patterned after styles first developed in Italy in the early 1900's -- cost $150 to $200 and weigh three to four pounds.These older designs, once the mainstay of the industry, make up only 20 percent of the market. &quot;The big, heavy Italian-style shoe now only accounts for 5 to 10 percent of our sales,&quot; said Stephen Gladstone, marketing director at Merrell Footwear in South Burlington, Vt., which had sales of about $11 million last year. &quot;In the late 70's, that's all there was.&quot;No one company has more than 5 percent of the market, according to Thomas B. Doyle, director of information and research at the National Sporting Goods Association, an industry group. &quot;There are many players out there with, relatively speaking, equal share of the market.&quot; K-Mart, which has its own brand,Nike,Red Wing and Hi Tec Sports USA, are the market leaders with about 5 percent each.The Timberland Company, in Hampton, N.H., which sold about $13 million worth of hiking boots last year, has been selling an in-between product for 20 years. Made of smooth, yellow leather, the low-cut boot is heavier than a lightweight but lighter than the traditional Italian boot, and it is suitable for camping, working or the street.&quot;The factor that's fueling the growth in hiking boots right now is that the public is discovering these boots are quite practical for street use,&quot; said David Getchell, equipment editor at Backpacker Magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The TechnologyBorrowing Features of Running ShoesThe move toward lightweight hiking shoes started in the early 80's. According to Craig Duerr, a marketing manager atNikein Beaverton, Ore., it began with the people at the company who were interested in hiking. They complained that the only available boots were too heavy and clunky. &quot;Can't we make something that's lighter?&quot; he recalled them asking one another.&quot;Nikewas the first to jump into that segment,&quot; said Josie Esquivel, securities analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;They did their market research and found outdoor sports were becoming a very hot trend.&quot;The most important characteristic manufacturers tout in their advertisements is the combination of lightness and strength, a result of the high-tech design. In an ad for its hiking shoe, Merrell Footwear claimed its patented air-cushion midsole &quot;takes running-shoe technology into the backcountry.&quot; A brochure for Vasque's Clarion line of lightweight boots shows a cross-section of a boot with references to a patented &quot;motion control device,&quot; a &quot;variable fit system,&quot; and a &quot;bumper-lug outsole.&quot; The point all the manufacturers are trying to convey is that running-shoe technology, applied to hiking boots, can provide greater comfort and stability.&quot;We're taking athletic-shoe technology and applying it to other areas,&quot; said Reebok's Mr. Guglielmetti, citing the science of biomechanics, which has resulted in the lighter weights and superior shock absorption of modern athletic shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the SuccessThe Correct Politics on the EnvironmentTypical of the athletic shoe manufacturer entering the &quot;green market&quot; is Reebok, which launched its new outdoor division last fall to target both the serious outdoor enthusiast and the general hiker.&quot;We see the decade of the 90's as one of wellness, of getting out into the environment with the family,&quot; said Mr. Guglielmetti, who was a product manager with L.L. Bean, the mail-order outfitter in Freeport, Me., before joining Reebok Outdoor.Fashion is also playing a role, with the new style of hiking boot combining the bright colors of the 80's active life style with the correct political line on the environment.&quot;It's a mental association, like the Jeep Cherokee,&quot; said Mr. Getchell. &quot;Most Jeeps never get mud higher than the hubcaps, but people like the idea they can go anywhere. Owning a pair of hiking boots is a way to enjoy some vicarious link to the wilderness even though you may be far removed from the woods.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRADITIONALISTS VS. INNOVATORSWhen the athletic-shoe companies, with their massive advertising budgets, began to enter the outdoor market, many small manufacturers of traditional hiking boots were skeptical. Some of the purists questioned the motives and long-term commitment of the giants.&quot;We see them as cynical, taking advantage of something we have been involved in from the very beginning,&quot; said Mr. Gladstone, of Merrell Footwear. The big manufacturers, according to Mr. Gladstone, only entered the hiking-boot market when the fitness-shoe market, their traditional stomping ground, became saturated.But while manufacturers like Merrell, with only $11 million in sales, may doubt the motives of such giants as Reebok,Nikeand K-Mart, hard-core backpackers do not object. &quot;If someone else is going to make a good boot, I don't care if they've been around for 2 years or 25 years,&quot; said Cindy Ross, who has written two books on her experiences hiking. &quot;If it looks good and feels good and has been field tested and reviewed by magazines, I'd use it.&quot;According to Ms. Ross, while lightweight boots do not last as long as heavier boots, they are easier to break in and less destructive to the outdoors.Even the purists admit the giants with their massive advertising budgets are helping to focus attention on the entire market. &quot;We like the advertising because it brings people to the outdoors,&quot; Mr. Gladstone said. &quot;We are not miffed. It's a great opportunity for us.&quot; But he added: &quot;Ten years from now, when the bloom is off the outdoor look, who's going to be left selling the stuff? It'll be the Vasques and the Merrells.&quot;",0.103298818299,0.48986993487,1480 words,DriftingNikeshelp ocean research,"October 10, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",192 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"THE graying of jockdom is apparent all along Madison Avenue. At age 39, Jimmy Connors is urging headache sufferers to &quot;Nupe it with Nuprin&quot; in television commercials and print advertisements created by J. Walter Thompson. Soon, BBDO Worldwide will add the tennis player to the roster of celebrities featured in Diet Pepsi's continuing &quot;You've got the right one baby, uh-huh!&quot; campaign.Mr. Connors is one of a teamful of sports stars with wrinkled brows beneath their headbands or receding hairlines under their helmets who are becoming more popular in advertising and as product endorsers. Advertising and sports executives attribute the growing appeal of aging athletes to their popularity with the baby-boom generation.&nbsp;In a new print ad by Wieden &amp; Kennedy forNikefootwear, Nolan Ryan, who is 44 years old, appears alongside an inspirational text that insists: &quot;It's easier to keep going if you never stop. Just do it.&quot; And in another print ad just coming out, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York for Duracell Inc., a photograph of the Texas Rangers pitcher in action appears under the headline &quot;He runs like he's on Duracell.&quot; These ads follow the pitcher's campaigns for Advil pain reliever, by Young &amp; Rubicam New York, and Wrangler jeans, by the Martin Agency Inc.George Foreman, the 42-year-old boxer, co-stars with Bo Jackson in aNikespot also created by Wieden; when Mr. Jackson walks out of a singing-and-dancing spot-within-the-spot, Mr. Foreman eagerly fills in.And the golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez, who is 55, is featured in ads for Toyota, by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Inc., and the Nestle Crunch candy bar, by Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor.As the 76 million consumers born between 1946 and 1964 get older, &quot;they respond to the guys and girls who hang tough and defy the odds,&quot; Scott Bedbury,Nike'sadvertising director, said in a telephone interview from his office in Beaverton, Ore. &quot;The Nolan Ryan ad is all about still doing it after all these years.&quot;It is &quot;kind of a wonderful confluency of celebrities and audience identification with them,&quot; said Nova Lanktree, director of the Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago consulting firm.Mr. Connors was a natural for Nuprin, said James Patterson, chairman of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York, because the baby boomers &quot;are the people beginning to get the muscle aches.&quot; Thompson signed the tennis star before his surprising success at the United States Open, Mr. Patterson added, but rushed to create additional ads to capitalize on his march to the semifinals.Another reason older athletes are becoming so visible is that they have known track records, meaning there are likely to be fewer surprises for advertisers and agencies. By contrast, a younger star-in-the-making still adjusting to the glare of the limelight can be caught, Mr. Patterson said, &quot;in a peccadillo on the front page,&quot; jeopardizing his or her value as an endorser.For all their rising popularity, aging athletes have a lap or two to go before threatening the advertising livelihoods of the most successful limber-limbed, fuzzy-cheeked younger athletes. Michael Jordan makes an estimated $15 million to $20 million a year through more than a dozen deals with marketers including Quaker Oats (Gatorade), General Mills (Wheaties), General Motors (Chevrolet) andNike.And Magic Johnson earns about $12 million a year from advertisers including Pepsi-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nestle Crunch, which signed him yesterday to be its principal pitchman, starting in January.And there is a danger that older athletes will diminish their worth to advertisers by risking what Ms. Lanktree called the &quot;humiliation and embarrassment&quot; of playing past their primes.Still, the phenomenon can continue to build, executives say, as athletes extend their playing careers by taking better care of themselves. One who could be in for big ad paydays nationally, Ms. Lanktree said, is Carlton Fisk, the 43-year-old catcher for the Chicago White Sox.&quot;In terms of baseball icons, you ain't seen nothing yet,&quot; Mr. Patterson agreed.",0.210058460058,0.47915972916,683 words,DriftingNikeshelp ocean research,"November 17, 1991, Sunday, SUNDAY SECOND EDITION",194 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Can anyone fill Michael Jordan's sneakers? Maybe not in playing basketball or selling shoes, but the up-and-coming David Robinson might get the chance to see if he can do as well in pitching soft drinks.The advertising and marketing industries have been abuzz for the last month with talk that Mr. Jordan will soon halt his two years of endorsements for the Coca-Cola Company for a more lucrative, longer-term deal to swallow Gatorade for the Quaker Oats Company. Until now, no one has suggested whom Coca-Cola might sign to replace the Chicago Bulls superstar.&nbsp;If Mr. Jordan leaves Coca-Cola next month, as expected, industry executives said Coca-Cola and its advertising agency, McCann-Erickson New York, might sign Mr. Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs.Mr. Robinson's appeal to Coca-Cola, the executives said, centers on the genial, yet hip, image he has earned since he began playing in the National Basketball Assocation two years ago. Just as Mr. Jordan has been the basketball star of the 1980's, the executives said, Mr. Robinson could well be the basketball star of the 1990's.Helping Mr. Robinson mightily in conveying his pleasing personality are his television commercials for the Force line of athletic footwear made byNikeInc. That campaign, created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., presents the athlete as the sole resident of &quot;Mr. Robinson's neighborhood.&quot;If Mr. Robinson signs with Coca-Cola, the executives said, his job would be similar to Mr. Jordan's for Coke Classic. He would play a small role in the overall &quot;Can't beat the real thing&quot; campaign for the country's best-selling soft drink. He would probably appear in two or three television commercials a year.Just for doing that, Mr. Jordan's year-to-year contract with Coca-Cola reportedly paid him about $2.5 million a year. By contrast, the agreement advertising people said Mr. Jordan had reached with Quaker calls for him to become the focus of Gatorade advertising created by Bayer Bess Vanderwarker, Chicago. Industry publications like Advertising Age and Adweek have reported that Mr. Jordan is about to sign a 10-year contract with Quaker worth $18 million.The industry executives described Mr. Jordan as being attracted to Quaker primarily because it offered him a long-term deal for Gatorade.Mr. Jordan's contract with Coca-Cola expires on July 31. The company plans to use its current spot starring Mr. Jordan until that date. In the spot, Mr. Jordan seems to defy gravity to reach a bottle of Coca-Cola Classic floating in space.Coca-Cola does not comment about potential endorsers it may be considering, said Bob Bertini, a company spokesman. &quot;There is always a lot of speculation about whom we may or may not sign,&quot; he added.Advertising Age reported that Mr. Jordan had already shot television and magazine ads for Gatorade, which might run in late summer. Quaker is expected to announce its deal with Mr. Jordan at a news conference in Chicago early next month, the executives said.Coca-Cola would probably pay Mr. Robinson about the same as Mr. Jordan and also make the contract a short-term one.Mr. Robinson'sNikecommercials have been widely praised for their humor. One shows him at home, celebrating his birthday and receivingNikeshoes from several basketball-playing friends. But David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, sends him an autographed photo -- of Mr. Stern.Another spot, however, came in for criticism. In it, Mr. Robinson, speaking in the style of Fred Rogers of public television's &quot;Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood,&quot; asked at one point, &quot;Can you say, 'Kick some butt?' &quot;Coincidentally, one of Mr. Robinson's friends in the birthday commercial is Mr. Jordan.Nike,which produces an Air Jordan line of shoes, is among more than a dozen companies that have signed Mr. Jordan to endorsement contracts with a total estimated annual value of $11 million to $15 million. Others include General Mills, for Wheaties cereal; Sara Lee, for Hanes clothing, and McDonald's.Mr. Robinson would join a number of other athletes in the Coca-Cola advertising lineup, including Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. Coke's Minute Maid Orange Soda commercials spotlight a basketball trio: Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks, Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons and Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks.",0.0691230486685,0.338659320478,727 words,DriftingNikeshelp ocean research,"February 3, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final",195 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"GREG Norman's absence from the $50 million US circuit, where he was leading money-winner last year with some $1.3 million, has been described as &quot;a sad state of affairs&quot; by tour officials.&quot;I feel sorry for Greg and I feel he has been over-managed,&quot; said tour commissioner Deane Beman this week, casting a clear barb at the International Management Group.Life certainly hasn't been easy for the Great White Shark in the US lately. He craves nothing more than to win major championships and the respect of his peers. To him they provide the purest barometers by which to measure true greatness.&nbsp;But his failure to emulate the deeds of contemporaries such as Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros has been widely discussed and criticised in magazines and newspapers and he has had to endure many personal attacks as well. Here's a cruel recent example from the once-great Johnny Miller: &quot;... some of the players are saying he has the heart of a grape seed.&quot; And even some spectators have turned against him. After some critical comments about the golf course the previous week in the Honda Classic, the spectators at Bay Hill pointed out that a man who makes millions a year should not be complaining about anything.It did not help that Norman pulled out of Tuesday's pro-am at the last minute, saying that he was &quot;over-golfed&quot; and then played in a pro-am the same day at Lost Tree, his home club in West Palm Beach.Comments directed at Norman during the Thursday's play included: &quot;Hey, Greg, did Nicklaus give you a release to play here this week?&quot; and &quot;Is the weather OK for you this week, Greggy?&quot; So it's good that the Shark is back in the clutches of his parents, Merv and Toini, for a few weeks, trying to regain touch with his roots, clear his seemingly confused (golfing) mind and play relaxing shots on the familiar terrority of Royal Queensland with his old coach Charlie Earp.MEANWHILE the Shark is unwittingly caught up in a storm over television commercials promoting golf shoes.Reebok International Ltd's use of Norman to endorse their &quot;pump&quot; shoes has upsetNikeso much that the latter is contemplating a lawsuit.During the commercial Norman uses the words &quot;c'mon Curtis, don't be strange&quot; when promoting his Reebok pumps.

Biskic announced midway through the campaign this would be his last season, suggesting he should be spending more time with his family.&nbsp;&quot;I felt at the time I was having a disappointing season and I was under a lot of pressure because the club was going through an uncertain period (in which coach Ante Grgic was sacked),&quot; Biskic said yesterday.&quot;I have always felt that I could continue playing for two or three more seasons and I probably would have ended up going down to a lower league club where the training demands are not as great.The matter has swung the other way with Biskic now under pressure to continue playing from the club's committee.&quot;If the club needs me I will stay, but it was more heartening that the coach (Ken Worden) also said he would like me to play on,&quot; Biskic said.Biskic turned 32 on Monday and described the $2000 prizemoney for the award as the ideal birthday present.&quot;I've been voted the club's best player twice but I have never before been voted the best player of the competition.

"SYDNEY: Price is no guide to quality in the high-tech fashion stakes of the running-shoe market, according to the Australian Consumer Association Magazine, Choice.The magazine said the cheapest shoes tested, selling for as little as $34, protected the feet from injury just as well as the $150 big-name brands like Adidas, Reebok, Puma andNike.And the cheapest shoes were the best casual runners by far.&nbsp;Choice asked Olympic pentathlete Alex Watson to put 12 pairs of running shoes, ranging in price from $34 to $160, through their paces over a 10km course, covering a variety of terrain.The shoes were tested for comfort, moisture evaporation, shock absorption, stability, construction, terrain-riding ability and flexibility and springiness.&quot;All 12 pairs rated highly, even though prices varied so widely,&quot; the magazine said.&quot;Price was not a guide to features such as comfort, shock, absorption, stabilility or flexibility.&quot;The magazine said the basic role of running shoes was to protect the foot from injury. But this role was obscured because of high-profile marketing and fashion hype which promoted expensive brands as the triumphs of the tracks.Choice found the Adidas Torsion ZX 4000 C, which costs $150, topped the 12 shoes tested with an overall safety level of 96 per cent.Another money-spinner,NikeAir Craft, selling for $140, ranked third in the list at 94 per cent.But the miser's sports shoe, the Dunlop KT 26, at about $34, romped into ninth place at 84 per cent. This cheap shoe equalled the big names in the stability, shock absorption and moisture-evaporation stakes.&quot;At a third of the price of many other shoes, it is hard to beat as a shoe which provides all the necessary qualities for casual runners, particularly heavy ones, as it offers a very stable, wide base,&quot; the magazine said.The magazine said running created a constant potential for injury.The harder the surface and the heavier the runner, the greater the stress on joints at every step.And, the test of a good running shoe is that it must be an effective shock absorber and it must keep the foot stable to prevent ankle injuries.How the shoes rated for overall safety:Adidas Torsion ZX 4000 C ($120-$150) 96 per cent; Puma-Trinomic 210 ($110-$160) 95;NikeAir Craft ($99-$140) 94; Brooks Rage HydroFlow ($75-$140) 92; Reebok Questor ERS ($108-$135) 89; Puma XR ($84-$100) 89; Saucony Freedom 1000 ($88-$120) 88; Asics Gel Runner TN 05 ($97-$130) 88; Hi-Tec Triathon ($71-$110) 85; Dunlop KT 26 ($34-$60) 84; New Balance M495 ($142-$149) 83; Adidas Quorum ($59-$80) 82.",0.0597398989899,0.416762626263,457 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","April 4, 1991 Thursday",205 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;MARKET SLUGGISH. The stock market ended mixed in light, lackluster trading Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.25 to close at 2,924.42. Advancing issues narrowly outpaced declining ones in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-BILLS MIXED. Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed Monday as the government auctioned $ 9.22-billion of three-month Treasury bills and $ 9.23-billion of six-month bills. The average discount rate for the three-month bill was 5.50 percent, unchanged from last week, while the average discount rate for the six-month bill was 5.63 percent, up from 5.61 percent. The discount rate understates the return to investors a yield of 5.67 percent on three-month bills and 5.89 percent on six-month bills. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills rose to 6.13 percent last week, up from 6.11 percent the previous week.&nbsp;NationProduction upin U.S. industries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON Snapping a six-month decline, the nation's factories, mines and utilities raised production slightly in April as assemblies of trucks and automobiles rebounded, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of 0.1 percent, while neither large nor unexpected, was seen as indicating that the economy was approaching its low point and that a recovery might be imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts were encouraged by the first rise in industrial output since September, but they added that more months of declining output might lie ahead before the economy was clearly seen to be on the mend.First Executive Corp.files for protection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Executive Corp., the troubled life insurance holding company facing billions of dollars in junk bond losses, said Monday that it filed for bankruptcy reorganization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles comes after California regulators last month seized the ailing holding company's largest insurance unit, Executive Life, in what constituted the largest insurance failure in the nation's history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any plan to reorganize the firm's companies under new ownership faces the likelihood that hundreds of millions of dollars owed to policyholders, holders of annuities and other securities will not be paid.&nbsp;Executive Life had been permitted under conservatorship to continue payment of death claims, some medical claims and about 70 percent of certain periodic payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payments were being made on 307 pension plans that used First Executive guaranteed investment contracts, which were technically not insured. Monday's bankruptcy filing further clouds the picture for policyholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida insurance officials said about 11,000 Floridians hold Executive Life insurance policies, but they do not know how many have annuities or 401(k) investments in the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FED TO MEET. The Federal Reserve is facing renewed pressure from the Bush administration and corporate America to supply another round of interest rate cuts to get the country out of the recession. But most economists predicted the central bank will adopt a wait-and-see approach when Fed policymakers meet for a strategy session Tuesday. For that reason, these analysts said that consumer borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, are not likely to decline significantly anytime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIKEADS LAUDED. The shoemakerNikeInc. nosed out fragrance maker Calvin Klein as the sponsor of the most popular print advertising campaign of 1990, according to a consumer survey.  Earlier this year,Nikeplaced second in a similar survey on television commercials for 1990. FollowingNikeand Calvin Klein in the Video Storyboard survey were ads for Camel cigarettes, Revlon cosmetics, Absolut vodka, Infiniti cars, Marlboro cigarettes, Guess apparel, Ford automobiles and trucks and Maybelline cosmetics.  Tampa Bay/State&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL PROTEST PLANNED. Sixty Florida farmers will take their campaign against a proposed free trade agreement with Mexico to the lawn of the nation's capital on Wednesday. They will have two rigs loaded with Florida produce and some strong words about how the proposed agreement would harm Florida's $ 6.2-million agricultural industry. State Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford is trying to persuade the Bush administration to keep tariffs in place year-round for citrus and during the growing months of January and February, when Florida is head-to-head in produce production for U.S. markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOB EVANS CLOSES OUTLETS. Bob Evans Farms Inc. on Monday closed two of its 255 restaurants, one on U.S. 19 N at Drew Street in Clearwater and the other in the Chicago area. The stores, which were closed because they were unprofitable, will be sold, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said. The Clearwater store opened in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUTMEG EARNINGS. Tampa-based Nutmeg Industries Inc. on Monday reported a continued earnings rebound with first quarter profits of $ 155,000, or 3 cents a share, compared to a loss of $ 292,000 in the comparable quarter in 1990.

"&nbsp;STOCKS DECLINE. The stock market drifted lower in slow trading Monday, still restrained by worries over rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 50.76 points last week, slipped 1.34 to 2,975.40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T-BILLS RISE. Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose Monday as the government auctioned $ 10-billion of three-month Treasury bills and $ 10.1-billion of six-month bills. The average discount rate for the three-month bill was 5.60 percent, up from 5.59 percent last week, while the average discount rate for the six-month bill was 5.78 percent, up from 5.71 percent. The discount rate understates the return to investors a yield of 5.78 percent on three-month bills and 6.05 percent on six-month bills. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills rose to 6.30 percent last week, up from 6.13 percent the previous week.&nbsp;NationCh. 13 parent getsfiling extension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federal bankruptcy judge in Denver has extended until June 25 the date that the parent company of WTVT-Ch. 13 has to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the nation's largest financial companies are trying to force Gillett Holdings Inc., which also owns television stations in Baltimore and California and two Colorado ski resorts, into the reorganization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Gillett, the Colorado executive who owns the junk-bond indebted Gillett Holdings, has been seeking to renegotiate the concern's debts out of court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Sidney Brooks on Monday ruled Gillett cannot have any further extensions, but the company has until June 25 because the Gillett's talks with creditors haven't been successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BANK BILL TARGETED. Rep. John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is trying to derail the Bush administration's proposed banking system overhaul from the legislative fast track. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., wants to move a comprehensive banking bill through the House before Congress recesses in early August. That likely would leave Dingell's panel with only a few weeks to review the legislation. In an 11-page letter to Foley released Monday, Dingell, D-Mich., argued he needed more time. Dingell is skeptical about key elements of the bill, including permitting commercial and industrial firms to own banks and allowing banks to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INVENTOR SUESNIKE.An Arlington, Va., inventor is putting on a full-court press against one of Michael Jordan's biggest backers,NikeInc. Charles Petrosky, a 73-year-old inventor who works out of a cluttered shop in his basement, claims in a federal suit in Alexandria, Va., that the manufacturing giant swiped his invention when it marketed the Air Jordan sneaker, named after the Chicago Bulls' star guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAS PRICES RISE. What do you get when you mix falling wholesale gasoline prices with a recession that has dampened demand? If you answered lower prices at the pump, you may be wrong. In one of those curiosities that seems peculiar to the oil business, motorists seem to be paying more and more for gasoline each week, even though some dealers are paying less. Critics say the major oil companies are once again exploiting consumers because summer driving season is here. The American Petroleum Institute said gasoline prices typically rise in the summer because of refining processes triggered by higher demand. The API also cited higher taxes and a higher per-barrel cost of crude oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNISYS NEARS SETTLEMENT. Unisys Corp. is nearing agreement with federal prosecutors to settle fraud charges stemming from schemes to obtain confidential bid information on defense contracts, government sources said Monday. The computer systems manufacturer, which has a plant in Oldsmar, could end up paying as much as $ 190-million to settle allegations arising from the Justice Department investigation known as &quot;Operation Ill Wind,&quot; said government sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEDERATED BILLS CLIMBING. Legal fees are approaching $ 90-million in the 17 months since Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a court trustee said. &quot;We've tried to control the fees,&quot; said bankruptcy court trustee Conrad Morgenstern. The companies, headquartered in Cincinatti, operate such retail stores as Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh and Burdines. Morgenstern said that if it takes $ 100-million in legal fees to bring a $ 10-billion company out of bankruptcy, that represents only 1 percent of the company's assets.Corrections&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jacaranda chapter of the American Business Women's Association will meet at 6 p.m. Saturday at Las Fontanas Restaurant, 15481 49th St. N, Clearwater.

"&nbsp;While Michael, 11, tried on the Air Jordans his parents had promised him for basketball camp, his 8-year-old sister, Kate, fondled the little-girl-sized Reebok Pump from the display. It's her dream shoe, but at $ 80, her parents won't go for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes it so cool?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When you push the pump button,&quot; she explained, &quot;it makes you, like, run faster, or it makes you, like, jump better. It helps you do aerobics. It feels like air is floating inside of your shoe.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, &quot;when you don't want to run real fast or jump, you press the button&quot; and the sneaker deflates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does she know all this if she has never worn a pair?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everybody knows about them,&quot; she said, clearly appalled that I'd had to ask. &quot;Like, it's a popular shoe.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more child hornswoggled by advertising, you might think: but no. Reebok's ads don't claim the Pump which pumps air into bladders in the shoe's lining to create a closer fit makes you run faster or jump higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reebok's John Morgan admits right up front that it doesn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's right. Zillions, the kidversion of Consumer Reports, proved it. They heard the same run-faster, jump-higher playground myth and decided to test it out. When they outfitted their kid testers in three kinds of shoes the Reebok Pump, theNikeAir Jordan and theNikeQuantum Force they found that the kids jumped to exactly the same heights in all three models, and actually ran a little bit slower in the Pumps, which were noticeably heavier than the other two. When the testers were told they could keep the shoes they liked best, nobody chose Pumps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Morgan, those results may need updating soon. Since Reebok introduced the first Pump, he says, they've streamlined its air-pump technology. The Pump they'll introduce in August, he says, weighs only 15 ounces per shoe, more than five ounces lighter than the model Zillions tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still won't make you run faster or jump higher. What it does do, Morgan says, is reduce ankle injuries. He says tests at the University of California at Berkeley matched 200 kids in low-tops against 200 kids in regular high-tops and 200 kids in Pumps and found that the Pump cut ankle injuries by 60 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where did the run-faster, jump-higher rap come from? Morgan doesn't know, but it doesn't surprise him. Kids, he says, &quot;have a tendency to build stories around shoes.&quot; For instance, a black high-top basketball shoe Reebok happened to introduce shortly after the death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias came to be known in the Washington, D.C., area as the Len Bias Memorial Shoe. And, on New England playgrounds, the black high-top Pump that the Boston Celtics' Dee Brown wears and that he so effectively called attention to during the NBA All Stars Slam-Dunk Contest last February by pumping and repumping before every try is known as the Deebok.- Patricia McLaughlin has written for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Washington Post and Rolling Stone magazine.",0.185628106461,0.472020880354,513 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","August 15, 1991 Thursday",208 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;Nancy Daniels, a former star runner and an exercise physiologist for theNikecompetitive team, said Wednesday she has been hired as the University of South Florida's first full-time cross country and track assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm really excited to be here; I used to run Division I and I'm excited to be back to Division I in a big way,&quot; Daniels said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniels had been informally assisting her husband, Jack, at Cortland State, N.Y., since 1986. The women's team there won the NCAA Division III cross-country championships in 1989 and 1990 and the indoor track title in 1990-91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We struggled with it for a week,&quot; Daniels said of leaving New York and her husband, who will retire from coaching at the end of this school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USF coach Bob Braman, whohas run both the men's and women's programs over the years, echoed those sentiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's got the credentials to really help us,&quot; he said. &quot;Her teams were Division III, but they were good enough to be top 10 in Division I. She's going to be a strong draw for us and she's strong in areas I'm not.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniels, 32, formerly Nancy Scardina, was one of the University of New Hampshire's best runners ever. She led the team to the NCAA cross-country championships in 1981 and to the NCAA outdoor track championships in 1982. In 1988, she qualified for the U.S.  Olympic Trials in the marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then worked physiologically and nutritionally with the nation's premier runners, including Mary Decker and Joan Benoit while atNike'sAthletes West from 1983-86. She also has published numerous papers on the exercise physiology of runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's helped,&quot; she said. &quot;I like giving people facts about running and see their eyes open. People don't like to believe you, but they can't dispute scientific facts and say, &quot;That's not what my high school coach told me.' I really love working with the kids.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USF women's program, just four years old, won its first cross-country title of any kind, the Sun Belt Conference crown, last fall under part-time assistant Judy Bogenschutz.

"&nbsp;If the prospect of Thanksgiving overindulgence leaves you feeling guilty, here's one way to ease a calorie-counting conscience and help others, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thanksgiving morning, Tuff Stuff exercise coordinators Joan Kilpatrick and Susan Harrod will conduct a special bench workout at Shore Acres Community Center. A donation of one non-perishable food item gets you in the class. Bring four more and you'll be eligible for door prizes that include exercise tapes, massages, pastries, free Tuff Stuff classes andNikesneakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's not enough, consider this: The food you bring will help fill the cupboards of the St. Petersburg Free Clinic Food Bank and feed those who won't have the same opportunities to indulge during the holiday season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it will be particularly helpful this year because the need is so great,&quot; said Sister Margaret Freeman, executive director of St.  Petersburg's Free Clinic. &quot;They (Kilpatrick and Harrod) are doing a great job of creating interest.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workout began six years ago and has become a Shore Acres tradition. Last year, 102 participants brought so much food it took four cars to haul it away. Harrod said the class began as a way to get people exercising during the holidays. A food drive was added the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We started going crazy (with activities),&quot; Harrod said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workout got bigger and busier every Thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the workout's door prizes are donated by radio stations, national exercise programs and local businesses. A chef will prepare strudels and Napoleons on site during the workout, then donate them as prizes. David Pittman will bring in a sound system for an added boost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's kind of exciting,&quot; Harrod said. &quot;The person who donates the most canned goods we crown her the Can Queen. Last year, the Can Queen brought in something like 70 cans.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being crowned queen has benefits. This year's prize package includes a pair ofNikes,a leotard and three months of Tuff Stuff classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happens if the person bringing the most cans is male?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's still the Can Queen,&quot; Harrod said. &quot;That's what the sash says.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the jovial atmosphere, Harrod and Kilpatrick are serious about their mission. Kilpatrick said she hopes participants will try to bring the foods needed most. Peanut butter, jelly, rice, soup, beans, powdered milk, dry cereal, canned meats and vegetables, dried or canned fruits, and boxed macaroni and cheese head the list.  If possible, bring the food in large paper bags that can be reused when the food is distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items with limited value are gourmet foods, such as caviar; foods that require added meat or have an expired freshness date; refrigerated products; and foods that must be prepared in a microwave. The Food Bank already has a good supply of baby food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is any indication, the class should fill up quickly. Harrod said about 85 benches from community centers throughout St.  Petersburg have been brought in for the step up/step down workout. Because each person needs a bench, the class size is limited to the number of benches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the workout so popular? &quot;I think it's just that there's nothing to do (on Thanksgiving morning),&quot; Harrod said, &quot;and plus, they feel guilty (about overeating).&quot;",0.127649077649,0.50089017589,568 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","May 14, 1991, Tuesday, North Suncoast Edition",211 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Americans understand this, we usedifferent lasts than they do in Italy. Italian lasts are more tapered fromthe ball of the foot to the toe, we make a fuller toe. Italian lasts areshallow at the toe, ours are much higher for comfort.&quot;That doesn't mean they sacrifice style. For all the firm has been ownedbyNikeInc. since 1988, there's no sign of the runners in the Cole-Haanstores. &quot;We operate as two separate companies. We do have a group ofproducts - Tensile Air - which putsNiketechnology into a dress shoe.&quot;The examples look just like any other street shoes but inside, they'recushioned &quot;they have the air built in, they will never deflate.&quot;That's just one group among many: everything from classic Americancountry footwear to sleek Italian slip-ons. Many of the shoes, as well ashandbags, come in woven leather and the same technique is applied to satinfor the perfect tuxedo pumps.Prices, she figures, will be about 17 per cent higher than in theUnited States, to cover the difference in the dollar and the higher costof doing business here. Stock for their Canadian wholesale accounts willbe housed in the basement. (&quot;No, I don't think that makes us competitorswith stores like Harry Rosen, we've been selling to him for years. It justmeans greater recognition of our name.&quot;)There are at present no plans to open other Canadian stores. &quot;You'vegot to have a starting point. You've got to do well before you go on.

Even senior adults liketo have nifty, new-technology gear, apparently ignoring the adage,&quot;comfortable as an old shoe.&quot;There's not much difference between shoes. If they fit and feel good,who cares what name they carry? Lots of people obviously care a lot.Reebok is suing other companies for copyright infringement.

Put the shoe on, pump inair for a tight fit, and win a gold medal.In the mid-1950s, European ski boots that pioneered the technology wereavailable in North America - although we can remember one broken anklethat they did not prevent.The shoe business is basically an advertising game. The company withthe best marketing strategy wins, and right now Reebok is the leader.Its shares trade at $30.75 (U.S.) in New York, an amazing recovery fromthe 52-week low of $8.87. Can it go any higher?Yes, says Value Line Inc. of New York. Reebok has introduced a productknown as Blacktop, a shoe for youngsters who play hockey, baseball,football and basketball on driveways and roads.Naturally, kids who love asphalt sports will play them, no matter whatthey wear on their feet. Blacktop shoes should appeal to the ones whodon't, but pretend they do.Reebok's competitors include the following:L.A. Gear Inc. of Los Angeles. It was saved from bankruptcy this weekby selling $100-million worth of shares to Trefoil Capital Investors. DoesTrefoil have marketing smarts? Probably not, but L.A.

"BY SUEIN L. HWANGThe Wall Street JournalNew YorkFORGET leg lifts and abdominal crunches. Today's aerobics instructors areturning to reggae, tai chi, hip hop and even prayer to lure aging babyboomers back into the fold.&quot;You wouldn't believe the goofy stuff we've seen,&quot; says Gordie Nye,marketing director for Reebok International Ltd., which is always on thelookout for new fitness routines that it can promote.&nbsp;Ten years ago, it took little more than a slim figure, a loud voice anda disco beat to get fat-obsessed yuppies to go for the burn. Aerobicsroutines, the invention of a California housewife, began with the simplemarriage of music and calisthenics. Aerobics introduced a generation ofwomen to the world of fitness and created a $1-billion (U.S.) market.Now, the recession, concern about possible injury and general boredomwith aerobics have led to a slide in participation. A recent survey in theUnited States by the National Sporting Goods Association found that thenumber of people performing aerobics more than once in the past year hasfallen 2.8 per cent since 1985 and sales of aerobics footwear in 1990dropped to 9.8 million pairs from 10.8 million in 1986.Many sports researchers believe the aerobics boom has come and gone.Many of the women who started working out in aerobics classes have beenlured away by stair-climbing machines, Rollerblading and other forms ofexercise.&quot;There's a faddist group among active people and they've already goneon to a third and fourth thing,&quot; says Thomas Doyle, research director atthe National Sporting Goods Association.But even skeptics concede that the aerobics industry has succeeded inmaintaining a loyal following by reinventing itself when necessary.Aerobics routines, at one time little more than a series of kicks andjumps, have grown more sophisticated, integrating jazzier moves and safer&quot;low-impact&quot; approaches.Some ambitious entrepreneurs are promoting what they hope will be thenext successful incarnation of aerobics. Reebok succeeded in promotingstep aerobics - stepping on and off an elevated bench - and now it iswilling to invest millions of dollars on promotion if it can come up witha promising new form of exercise that will help sell sportswear.What does it take to gain attention? First, find a gimmick. Reebok, ofCanton, Mass., experimented with a California-born notion calledKneedspeed, in which the exerciser makes skating motions on a piece oflinoleum in stocking feet. But the company finally abandoned the conceptbecause it didn't seem to have strong appeal.In Washington, D.C., the Synergy Studio offers a &quot;holistic&quot; approach.&quot;There's a spiritual need for people to connect with their bodies,&quot; saysRoger Piantadosi, co-owner of the studio.Classes begin with meditative quiet and are designed around fivenatural elements, such as water. In one recent class, a group of mostlyaffluent professionals in their 30s pounded their bare feet to the beat ofAfrican drums and slapped their stomachs while emitting hoarse grunts.&quot;Around the fire and the Earth,&quot; commanded instructor Charmaine Schore asthe women shook convulsively while lying on their backs. &quot;Draw the spiritto you!&quot;Synergy Studio grossed $195,000 in 1990, up 30 per cent from the yearbefore, and it now has plans to develop videos and train more instructors.Others take a celestial approach.As instructor Jeannie Blocher leads a class at Body &amp; Soul MinistriesInc. in Germantown, Md., the words to a song blare out: &quot;It won't be long'til we see Jesus. It won't be long 'til He'll be here, yeah, yeah.&quot;This non-profit program counts more than 200 aerobics teachers in itsnon-denominational clergy. Ms. Blocher hopes to expand the program andplans a video release. &quot;I would like to see it spread and just continue asthe Lord wishes,&quot; says the 42-year-old mother of three. &quot;We call ourselvesBody and Soul Missionaries.&quot;Deferring to the aging of their target market, many programs haveeliminated difficult jumping or kicking moves while focusing on new ethnicbeats. Esther Gutierrez-Sloan, a Colombian immigrant and president ofSalsarobics Inc., hopes her Latin-styled aerobics will help her rumbaright past the competition.The former computer consultant is looking for outside investors tofinance an ambitious business plan that includes franchises and a line ofworkout wear. &quot;The music's very unique and culturally educational,&quot; shesays. &quot;And it makes women feel sensual.&quot;Not everybody's convinced that new forms of aerobics will have mucheffect on demand. &quot;Yes, you're going to bring in different kinds ofpeople,&quot; says Kathie Davis, executive director of IDEA, an industry group.&quot;But you aren't going to have a massive effect on the numbers.&quot;Rather than promote specialized aerobics routines, Reebok rivalNikeInc. is focusing on the versatility of its aerobics shoes.Nike, of Beaverton, Ore., says sales of its cross-training shoes are up&quot;very significantly&quot; from past years and it has started a marketingcampaign featuring its Elite aerobic shoes in a variety of workouts.&quot;Women do many things in their lives and a step-aerobics shoe isn'tthat uniquely different&quot; from other aerobics shoes, saysNike'saerobicsapparel marketing manager. &quot;We can't all own five pairs of shoes.&quot;Reprinted with permission of The Wall Street Journal1991 Dow Jones &amp; Co.

"BY MARTY YORKIS the Rocket on the verge of flying off to the National Football League?Well, one of the premier football reporters in the United States istelling his viewers and readers that he has definite and irrefutableinformation that Raghib Ismail - otherwise known as the Rocket - will beemployed in the NFL by next season.&quot;And maybe even before the end of this NFL season,&quot; Fred Edelstein saidin a telephone interview yesterday.&nbsp;&quot;Every piece of information I have indicates that the length ofRocket's career with the Toronto Argonauts will be exactly one season.&quot;He's on his way to the Los Angeles Raiders. I wouldn't be surprised,in fact, if the Raiders have him in a uniform by next month.&quot;Edelstein's track record on football scoops is outstanding. Viewers ofhis weekly program on ESPN and readers of the well-circulated EdelsteinPro Football Letter can attest to that.And Don Crump didn't do much to dispel Edelstein's information when Ispoke to him yesterday. In fact, the Canadian Football League commissionerbacked it up pretty well when he admitted that Argo governor Sue Waksrecently told him in an angry moment that club owner Bruce McNall wasconsidering the notion of sending Ismail to the Raiders.&quot;She said, 'Don't think Bruce won't send Rocket over to Al,' &quot; Crumpsaid. &quot;She meant Al, as in Al Davis (owner of the Raiders).&quot;Who knows? If the Rocket leaves, maybe it'll be the start of a trendfor the CFL. Maybe a lot of big-name players will come over for one seasonand then go to the NFL.&quot;Reached in Los Angeles yesterday, Waks denied making any threats aboutIsmail to Crump. She also said Ismail has enjoyed his rookie season withthe Argos and that she would be &quot;shocked&quot; if he jumped to the Raidersafter the CFL season.Beverly Ballard, whom Ismail employs as a public-relations aide, echoedWaks's sentiments, saying that the Rocket intends to honour all fourseasons of his $18-million, Argonaut contract.&quot;But what you must understand,&quot; Edelstein said, &quot;is that the NFL andthe CFL are leagues of denial. They deny everything. It's just a mode ofoperation for them. The fact that they deny something doesn't meananything.&quot;If I were operating the Argos, or if I were the Rocket, I'd deny thewhole thing, too. What purpose would it serve to confirm that he's leavingright before the playoffs?&quot;But you can be sure it's happening. The Rocket will end up with about$6-million from McNall and will then accept a deal for a lot less fromDavis.&quot;Hey, if things were gangbusters in Toronto, if the Argos were sellingout the place and there was Argomania, it would be incumbent to continuethe deal. But being that none of this has happened, that the signingreally hasn't produced an outstanding television deal in the States,McNall has a nice parachute. He can just hand the Rocket over to theRaiders, and the Rocket won't mind, no matter what anyone else sayspublicly.&quot;In the latest edition of his publication, Edelstein wrote:&quot;We hear Ismail is definitely hot on joining the Raiders next year. Oursources say he is having fun in Canada and that his relationship withBruce McNall is pretty good. But the CFL isn't the NFL and Rocketapparently misses the United States and the bright lights.&quot;Technically, players are not permitted to toil in the CFL and NFL inthe same year.&quot;But,&quot; Edelstein said, &quot;when it becomes clear that Rocket's not comingback to Toronto and that he can get out of his CFL deal and his personalservices contract with McNall, it might be possible for the Raiders tomake a strong argument for getting him before the end of this year.&quot;From what I'm hearing out of the Raiders and people who are close tothe Rocket, this is the way it's going. I won't say it's a done deal, butunderstand that Al Davis is a shrewd man. He knows that the Rocket wantsto play in the NFL. He knows exactly to the dime how much McNall islosing. And he has a friendship with McNall in Los Angeles. He knows aboutthe escape clauses in Rocket's deal. This would not be a hostilesituation.&quot;Look, McNall has taken a bit of a bath on this thing. He took acourageous shot and it didn't really pay off the way he'd hoped. Theeasiest way to get out of this is to let Rocket go to the Raiders.&quot;By selecting Rocket in the last NFL draft, Al Davis has him exactlywhere he wants him. He's not going to bring in the Rocket and pay him $3-million a year. He doesn't have to. If he pays him any more than $1.5-million a year, I'd be shocked.&quot;Edelstein, incidentally, also reported that the Rocket has fired hisagent, Ed Abrams, over a decision to turn down aNikecommercial.&quot;Remember the recentNikecommercial with Bo Jackson dancing in abroadway show set?&quot; Edelstein wrote. &quot;Sources close to the Ismailsituation say that was supposed to be Rocket's commercial.&quot;The way we hear it, Rocket's mother was furious over the decision toblow offNikeand that the Rocket fired Abrams at his mother's urging.&quot;Preferred Management, a firm put together in part by former tennis starArthur Ashe, is now handling Ismail's finances.

He hobbled&nbsp;everywhere Thursday. The man of two sports and a zillion products was on&nbsp;crutches, the result of a hip injury last month in a Los Angeles Raiders&nbsp;playoff game. He will be on crutches for four weeks and may, according to&nbsp;a team doctor for his other employer, the Kansas City Royals, miss the&nbsp;season opener.But that didn't stop the dominant sports figure from enhancing his&nbsp;dominant marketing presence. Jackson flew into Atlanta from Auburn about&nbsp;1 p.m. and in the next eight hours: (1) posed for publicity pictures with&nbsp;a young boy for the March of Dimes, (2) held a fireside chat with top&nbsp;Nikeexecutives and buyers in conjunction with the Super Show (he was not&nbsp;out for public or media display), (3) was introduced as the part owner&nbsp;and product spokesman for &quot;Bo Med,&quot; a sports medicine line manufactured&nbsp;by Cramer Products, at a Georgia World Congress Center news conference,&nbsp;(4) was introduced in grand style at the Westin as part owner and chief&nbsp;spokesman for a new line of weightlifting equipment to be manufactured by&nbsp;DP.And then? Bo hobbled into a waiting limo at about 9 p.m. and was&nbsp;whisked to the airport, where he caught a return flight to Auburn. Why&nbsp;the rush?&quot;He has a final exam to take tomorrow,&quot; said Susann McKee, who as an&nbsp;associate to Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, is charged with making sure&nbsp;Bo knows punctuality. &quot;He's still working on his degree in child and&nbsp;family development.&quot;Bo needs no courses on income development. He will earn nearly $ 4&nbsp;million in the next baseball and football seasons from the Royals ($ 2.375&nbsp;million) and the Raiders ($ 1.6175 million) - and that is dwarfed by his&nbsp;off-field(s) earnings. Bo also has become quite polished on speaking to&nbsp;business executives.But he wouldn't discuss his injury Thursday. Royals trainer Steve&nbsp;Joyce said Jackson &quot;isn't in the mild injury category.&quot; But when asked at&nbsp;the &quot;Bo Med&quot; gathering if he would be ready in time for the Royals season&nbsp;opener, Jackson said, &quot;Man, I'm not here to talk about that.&quot;However, when explaining the advantages of his &quot;Bo Med&quot; ankle brace,&nbsp;Jackson joked, &quot;We need to make one of these for a hip injury.&quot;More jokes flowed at the DP cocktail party. &quot;I never knew DP made&nbsp;more weights than anybody in the country,&quot; Bo said. &quot;See, that's&nbsp;something Bo doesn't know.&quot;",0.0310606060606,0.419385026738,533 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","September 13, 1991 Friday",218 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Others are more high profile - Bobby Knight and John&nbsp;Thompson, Dick Vitale, and a large number of coaches and scouts from the&nbsp;NBA.Yet as Nevada-Las Vegas pursues its second consecutive national&nbsp;championship this weekend in Indianapolis, Tarkanian's friends join his&nbsp;foes in wondering whether the NCAA's pursuit of the embattled coach - and&nbsp;anticipated sanctions at season's end - finally will prompt either his&nbsp;retirement or a departure to the NBA.Tark isn't telling.Perhaps it's because he himself is uncertain. On a given day, he&nbsp;professes to be a college coaching lifer, best suited for 40 minutes of&nbsp;frenzy and 30-odd games in a community that is appreciative, if not&nbsp;always approving, of his methods. (He has his detractors in Las Vegas,&nbsp;too.) Yet, on another day, Tarkanian ponders life after Vegas.&nbsp;&quot;Maybe I should go to the NBA,&quot; he offers, frowning. &quot;I don't need&nbsp;all this.&quot;At 60, Tarkanian clearly could rest on his coaching laurels. He has&nbsp;a career record of 811-145, is the second-winningest active Division I&nbsp;coach with 598 victories and has guided the Runnin' Rebels to 45&nbsp;consecutive wins, one NCAA title and a second straight trip to the Final&nbsp;Four.He earns $ 203,000 in salary, $ 200,000 for a shoe contract and&nbsp;approximately $ 250,000 in free tickets to UNLV games. But he also has&nbsp;received 19 years of intense scrutiny and an assortment of penalties&nbsp;levied by the NCAA. This year, for instance, the Rebels were banned from&nbsp;appearing on television in 1992 and from participating in the postseason&nbsp;tournament, sanctions levied for violations dating back to the 1970s. The&nbsp;Rebels also are confronting 29 new allegations pertaining to the&nbsp;recruitment of New York prep star Lloyd Daniel, and reportedly are being&nbsp;investigated again for the recruitment of Los Angeles area prep star Ed&nbsp;O'Bannon.&quot;There is no program in the country that receives one-tenth the&nbsp;scrutiny we do,&quot; said Tarkanian. &quot;Every player who leaves our program,&nbsp;they are trying to find something on. Our kids don't deserve this.&quot;But does Tarkanian? While his national image may be tarnished, he&nbsp;enjoys surprisingly strong support from unlikely sources, including&nbsp;Thompson, Knight, former UCLA coach John Wooden, former Cal coach Pete&nbsp;Newell, Seton Hall's P.J. Carlesimo and Utah's Rick Majerus. &quot;I'm not&nbsp;anti-NCAA or anything,&quot; Majerus said recently, &quot;but most of the coaches&nbsp;really like Tark. They think he's a good guy, a very decent person.&quot;Accordingly, those close to him are alert for signs of trouble, for&nbsp;any indications that the pressure finally has worn him down. Yet they say&nbsp;none is visible. Tarkanian has no hair to lose (he shaves his head), is&nbsp;not a heavy drinker and remains in relatively good shape for his years.&nbsp;Even his warm and engaging personality, they maintain, has remained&nbsp;consistent, as has his professional persona.While Tarkanian capitalizes on every opportunity to publicly flail&nbsp;the NCAA for its &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and plead his case to every reporter and&nbsp;for any interested publication, he responds to attacks on his program and&nbsp;his character with an amazing grace. For those who have yet to meet&nbsp;Tarkanian, the publicity staff schedules individual interviews like an&nbsp;all-comers' meet: You come to UNLV, you meet Tark. And even his most&nbsp;relentless critics relate how he continues to accept their phone calls,&nbsp;and often engages them in conversation.&quot;Jerry doesn't stay mad at anybody,&quot; said UNLV publicist Joe Hawk.A former Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter who wrote a damaging&nbsp;article in December 1989 about the high-priced cars several of the Rebel&nbsp;players were driving around town, Hawk subsequently was hired as the&nbsp;school's sports information director without opposition from Tarkanian.&nbsp;&quot;It was a little awkward at first,&quot; said Hawk, &quot;but Jerry's been very&nbsp;good to me.&quot;If anyone appears to have succumbed to the pressure, it would be a&nbsp;few of the players, though even this is arguable. After Hawk's story&nbsp;broke, Stacey Augmon and Larry Johnson initiated a team-wide ban on&nbsp;speaking to the media, though most of the Rebels relented during last&nbsp;year's postseason tournament. Augmon again refused to speak with&nbsp;reporters for most of this past season, despite encouragement to do so by&nbsp;Tarkanian.To a player, the Rebels remain true to their coach and his cause. At&nbsp;times, Johnson said, the controversy served only to strengthen their&nbsp;resolve and unite an already close-knit group. Before the tip-off of each&nbsp;game during the NCAA Tournament, for instance, the players embrace&nbsp;quietly, seemingly for themselves rather than for effect.Tarkanian, too, sees this, and it makes him wonder even further&nbsp;about the NBA. At UNLV, he rules not unlike Knight, Thompson, or any&nbsp;number of other major-college coaches. He controls. He dictates. He&nbsp;doesn't like a player, the player isn't around the following year. He&nbsp;doesn't like the schedule, the schedule is altered. He doesn't like the&nbsp;uniforms, new ones are on order.Can he claim this power in the NBA? Not likely, and he knows it.&quot;I just don't see him leaving,&quot; Sonny Vaccaro, theNikeexecutive,&nbsp;said last weekend in Seattle. &quot;He's got it made in Vegas. Why would he&nbsp;want to leave?&quot;What if the NCAA assesses a lengthy penalty based on various&nbsp;allegations involving Lloyd Daniels and others?&quot;I . . . still don't see him leaving,&quot; persisted Vaccaro.Yet the speculation continues. Within the past few months, he has&nbsp;been rumored reuniting with former Long Beach State athletics director&nbsp;Fred Miller at San Diego State, although that possibility appears moot&nbsp;now that head coach Jim Brandenburg signed a one-year contract extension.&nbsp;Tarkanian's name also has been linked to a pair of the NBA's troubled&nbsp;franchises, the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers.One current NBA head coach - another friend of Tarkanian's - says&nbsp;that coaching in the NBA &quot;would kill Tark. He could never accept all the&nbsp;losses.&quot; Atlanta Hawks general manager Pete Babcock notes that &quot;coaches&nbsp;who have been very successful, and used to winning 90 percent of games,&nbsp;come into the league and you don't win 90 percent of your games. All of&nbsp;the ex-college coaches I've talked to acknowledge how shocked they are at&nbsp;how different and how demanding the game is.&quot;As for Tarkanian, &quot;He's definitely capable,&quot; continued Babcock.&nbsp;&quot;He's an outstanding coach. If you look at his team, his team concept of&nbsp;defense is so impressive. He does a terrific job. But typically, a new&nbsp;NBA head coach goes to a struggling team. Would he want that?&quot;; Runnin' Rebels triviaThe Runnin' Rebels' unblemished 27-0 regular-season record was the&nbsp;first in Division I since Alcorn State and Indiana State in 1979. Larry&nbsp;Bird's Indiana State team went 33-1, the sole defeat was against Magic&nbsp;Johnson's Michigan State club in the NCAA title game. The rest, as they&nbsp;say, is history.- According to the 1990-91 media guide, reserve forward Chris Jeter&nbsp;of Morse High in San Diego was recruited by Georgia and lists his&nbsp;favorite player as the Atlanta Hawks' Cliff Levingston, who was his &quot;Big&nbsp;Brother&quot; during his childhood. Someone forgot to mention that Levingston&nbsp;changed teams in the offseason.- Seldom-used guard David Rice made the only start of his career&nbsp;Feb. 23 against UC Irvine - on the annual Seniors Night. While the NBA&nbsp;will not come calling, law schools will. Rice was a Rhodes Scholar&nbsp;finalist with a 3.96 grade point average in business and political&nbsp;science.- Besides improving his overall shooting percentage from .553 to&nbsp;.594 this season, Stacey Augmon bettered his 3-point accuracy from .320&nbsp;to .458, further enhancing his prospects as an NBA lottery pick.- Coach Jerry Tarkanian says that reserve center Elmore Spencer of&nbsp;Atlanta, a former Georgia Bulldog, has always excelled in practice, but&nbsp;struggled in games. &quot;Poor Elmore,&quot; said Tarkanian. &quot;One of these games&nbsp;he's going to play well, though.&quot; He did, being named Player of the Game&nbsp;against Utah.- UNLV was limited to single-digits in offensive rebounding only&nbsp;three times this season, but twice against schools from New Jersey. The&nbsp;Rebels claimed a season-low four offensive rebounds against Princeton and&nbsp;nine against Rutgers.

"Despite the recession, Americans are opening their wallets to help&nbsp;those in dire straits at home and abroad, representatives from relief&nbsp;organizations said Thursday.&quot;When Americans see a problem and a concern, they want to respond,&quot;&nbsp;said Kenneth H.

"PHILADELPHIA - Sales ofNikeInc.'s new cross-training athletic shoe&nbsp;went from zero in 1987 to an estimated $ 400 million this year, and Bo and&nbsp;everybody else know one big reason why.In addition to selling a lot of shoes, the advertising campaign&nbsp;featuring athlete Bo Jackson firmly established the small ad shop of&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy as undoubtedly the hottest agency in Portland, Ore.Now Wieden &amp; Kennedy has taken on another challenge, that of trying&nbsp;to get Subaru of America out of reverse. As a result of its landing the&nbsp;high-profile, high-billing account, Wieden &amp; Kennedy is opening a&nbsp;Philadelphia branch, which, by itself, will rank as one of the city's&nbsp;largest agencies.&nbsp;The first Subaru ads by Wieden &amp; Kennedy are to appear around Labor&nbsp;Day. Both the car company and the agency are mum on the content, but&nbsp;Subaru's director of advertising, Mark Dunn, promises that &quot;they're&nbsp;definitely something completely different&quot; from other auto ads.The campaign already is something different in one respect.&nbsp;Virtually all automotive advertising has been done by big Madison Avenue-&nbsp;based agencies. Nine-year-old Wieden &amp; Kennedy, by contrast, had never&nbsp;had a nationwide client until it won the account ofNike, based in&nbsp;Beaverton, Ore.; Bo knows' brought attentionThe overwhelming success of the &quot;Bo knows&quot; ads brought prosperity&nbsp;and rapid growth to Wieden &amp; Kennedy. For several years, the agency had&nbsp;all it could handle just keeping up with its star account.But when Subaru went looking for a new agency about three months&nbsp;ago, Wieden &amp; Kennedy felt it was ready for another big account. And&nbsp;Subaru, suffering from losses and shrinking market share, was ready to&nbsp;try something fresh.Subaru of America, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., took off in the 1970s&nbsp;with what was then a unique product, an inexpensive four-wheel-drive&nbsp;passenger car. With Subaru all the way was its New York ad agency,&nbsp;Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver.But Subaru went into a skid in the mid-'80s. Other carmakers brought&nbsp;out and elaborated on four-wheel-drive models, and they had other models&nbsp;and better-established corporate identities to lure customers.Subaru of America began suffering losses and shrinking sales, and,&nbsp;last fall, the parent carmaker back in Japan, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.,&nbsp;took matters into its own hands. It bought the Subaru of America stock&nbsp;that had been publicly held and began direct operation of the subsidiary.; Wanted to be major accountOn April 11, Subaru put its advertising account &quot;into review,&quot;&nbsp;meaning it was up for grabs. Subaru was looking for some specific traits&nbsp;in its agency, said spokesman Richard Marshall.&quot;We wanted to be a major account but not their sole account,&quot; he&nbsp;said. Nor did Subaru want to be one of many sizable accounts held by an&nbsp;agency.The strategy was to find an agency big enough to have the resources&nbsp;to service a national account but small enough that Subaru would command&nbsp;management's undivided attention.A consultant helped narrow the list to a half-dozen candidates. One&nbsp;by one, they trooped to a meeting room in the Hyatt Cherry Hill to make a&nbsp;presentation for about nine top-ranking Subaru executives.David Luhr led Wieden &amp; Kennedy's four-hour presentation. Although&nbsp;he can't discuss the creative concepts he pitched, he says that the&nbsp;presentation was built around the idea that &quot;Subaru always has had a&nbsp;distinct personality. It was not a Honda, not a Toyota; it was always&nbsp;styled a little differently.&quot;; Basic, reliable, but dullSubaru has always been thought of as a car that was &quot;basic, Spartan,&nbsp;durable and reliable, but not very pretty to look at,&quot; says Mr. Marshall&nbsp;of Subaru.Indeed, that is the theme of Levine, Huntley's last work for Subaru,&nbsp;the &quot;Never Die&quot; commercials that depict latter-day, upscale Subaru&nbsp;drivers discomfited to run across battered but hard-working old Subarus&nbsp;that look as if they are being driven by Okies escaping the Dust Bowl.The ads clearly say that Subaru wants a new image. It now falls to&nbsp;Wieden &amp; Kennedy to determine what that image will be.The market for compact and subcompact cars is extremely competitive,&nbsp;with literally dozens of similarly priced and equipped contenders.In that kind of market, &quot;advertising can really make a difference,&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Luhr says, so Wieden &amp; Kennedy can rightly claim credit if Subaru's&nbsp;fortunes begin to turn around. By the same token, Subaru has placed a&nbsp;great chunk of its fate in the agency's hands.Wieden &amp; Kennedy promised Subaru that it would open a branch near&nbsp;Cherry Hill to service the account.; Philadelphia office plannedBid the middle of July, Mr. Luhr also plans to staff an office of&nbsp;about 40. Enough people will be brought in from Portland to assure that&nbsp;the new office really is a Wieden &amp; Kennedy site, but the majority are&nbsp;expected to be new hires.The Philadelphia office will be a branch, but one that could grow as&nbsp;large as its home office. The Portland office has about 120 employees and&nbsp;handles $ 250 million in annual billings.The Subaru account alone will have 40 employees and up to $ 70&nbsp;million in billings. In Philadelphia, where relatively few agencies&nbsp;handle national accounts, few shops have billings of more than $ 100&nbsp;million from all sources.Mr. Luhr says the Philadelphia office eventually will look for other&nbsp;accounts, but for about a year or so, it will handle only Subaru.&quot;This is a huge account for us, and we're going to get comfortable&nbsp;with it first,&quot; he says.Larry Fish writes for Knight-Ridder Newspapers.",0.0635975352772,0.406753402847,929 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","February 13, 1991, Wednesday",223 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"WASHINGTON - Americans' exhilaration about communism's collapse is&nbsp;mingled with dismay about facets of their capitalism. Americans are not&nbsp;toppling statues of tycoons - there aren't many - the way Russians are&nbsp;venting their anger against Lenin's statues. But there is anger, about&nbsp;the BCCI and Salomon Brothers scandals, the S&amp;L debacle and soon perhaps&nbsp;about the way some corporate leaders are paying themselves.The compensation of CEOs is often ludicrous in light of corporate&nbsp;performance. Often it is difficult to determine how much CEOs are paid.&nbsp;Compensation packages can be wondrously difficult to decipher. But&nbsp;America's CEOs are paid two to three times more than Japan's or&nbsp;Germany's.&nbsp;In Japan, the compensation of major CEOs is 17 times that of the&nbsp;average worker; in France and Germany, 23-25 times; in Britain, 35 times;&nbsp;in America, between 85 and 100 times. The American CEO/worker disparity&nbsp;doubled during the '80s.How do you appropriately reward individuals' contributions at the&nbsp;pinnacle of complex, sprawling corporations? The slogan &quot;pay for&nbsp;performance&quot; does not take us far. Madonna made $ 25 million last year?&nbsp;Fine. Her pay is directly a function of performances. If Roger Clemens&nbsp;stops winning, his $ 5 million salary will stop. Not so with CEOs.The CEO of Eagle Picher Industries got a 38 percent raise while&nbsp;profits were falling 27 percent. Because times are hard for the&nbsp;automobile industry, Ford's CEO took a pay cut last year. But Chrysler's&nbsp;Lee Iacocca took a 25 percent raise - while earnings were falling 17&nbsp;percent.According to Business Week, in 1990 Disney's CEO made more in a day&nbsp;than the average Disney employee made in the year. Is there an economic&nbsp;or moral justification for that, or just a power explanation?Business Week reports that since 1988 Reebok's CEO has received&nbsp;$ 40.9 million. But $ 100 invested in Reebok stock in 1988 was worth only&nbsp;$ 117 by 1990.Nike, which passed Reebok as leader in the sneaker industry&nbsp;as Reebok profits were growing just 1 percent last year, has a CEO who&nbsp;made a three-year total of $ 1 million in 1988-90 whileNike'sreturn on&nbsp;equity averaged a robust 23 percent a year. Perhaps Reebok's CEO was&nbsp;worth $ 14.8 million in 1990, but why, precisely? He would have done his&nbsp;job less well for a piddling, oh, $ 7 million? Would the company have done&nbsp;worse with a $ 7 million - or even $ 1 million - replacement? Time may&nbsp;tell: His new contract limits his pay, or at least cash pay, to $ 2&nbsp;million.Topping Business Week's annual survey of executive compensation for&nbsp;1990 is United Airlines' CEO. He received $ 18.3 million in salary,&nbsp;bonuses and an incentive plan. United's profits fell 71 percent.The word &quot;incentives&quot; is prominent in CEO compensation packages.&nbsp;Think about that. Incentives to do what, exactly? One's job? One's job&nbsp;well? Or better than one would unless lethargy were conquered by lots of&nbsp;cash? Economists worry that many incentive plans encourage a short-term&nbsp;focus on a few numerical goals, such as stock prices. Those can be&nbsp;floated up by a general market rise unrelated to executive performances.Congress is considering requiring better disclosure of compensation&nbsp;and strengthening stockholders' powers to control it.

"&nbsp;'THE ARM is a billboard,' drawled Pro Serve's good-natured press officer James Jolly. The Washington-based management company has four of the priciest billboards in tennis; two belong to Gabriela Sabatini and two to Stefan Edberg.Where better to showcase these admirable advertising hoardings than at Wimbledon, the competition Jolly describes as 'the jewel in the crown of tennis'. Despite the higher prize money of some US tournaments and blanket TV coverage of the French Open, it is still Wimbledon that the key players want to win most and that includes the marketing and management companies.&nbsp;Only Edberg's shock defeat by Michael Stich in the semi-finals stopped the Pro Serve from 'doing the double' with two Wimbledon finalists. Edberg might have missed out on the big prize at Wimbledon, but his bank balance will not be unduly troubled by the absence of the pounds 240,000 winner's cheque.Edberg was tennis's top earner last year with prize money of pounds 1.2million. Add payments for exhibition matches, the sponsorship deals with Adidas, Wilson, Ebel watches, Fuji and Volvo and the figure approaches the pounds 5million mark.Sabatini has a similarly impressive number of motifs adorning her person courtesy of Sergio Tacchini (clothes), Seat, Avis, Longines (watches) and in her spare time promotes her eponymous brand of perfume. Sabatini is the marketing man's dream, a feminine, popular and successful tennis star. And answers to journalists' inquiries about her lifestyle read like a brand directory: she has a Walkman, 30 pairs of Ray-Bans, a white Seat, a Longines watch, and she shops at The Gap. Hardly surprising that her pounds 600,000 tennis earnings last year can be computed into a net worth closer to pounds 10million.But the marketing coup of the Wimbledon championships was the deal Procter &amp; Gamble struck with 15-year old wunderkind Jennifer Capriati to publicise Oil of Ulay skin cream. Capriati lost to Sabatini in the semi-finals, but the youngster wore her art clearly on her sleeve, albeit with the product's US brand name 'Oil of Olay'. There was no mistaking the brand's pink and black lettering, however.Capriati's defeat of Navratilova (who has won pounds 9million in prize money during her career) in the quarter-finals was heaven-sent for P&amp;G's marketing. The next day their agency, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, placed press ads in the Evening Standard showing Capriati in full flight, captioned 'Jennifer Capriati always wears white at Wimbledon'.P&amp;G will not discuss the value of the contract but, combined with a clothing contract from Diadora, Capriati is estimated to pull in pounds 4million from long-term contracts. As long as Capriati does not suffer juvenile burn-out, experts estimate that her earning potential will be around dollars 20million over the next ten years good news for her management company, Mark McCormack's IMG.The undisputed king of the sponsorship contract is the colourful Andre Agassi. Sports clothing companyNikepays the long-haired star around pounds 1million a year for wearing its luminous shirts and eye-catching two-in-one 'liner shorts' a combination of baggy denim shorts and tight black lycra cycling shorts. Before the Wimbledon fortnight, the mere thought of such garish outfits appearing on Centre Court was enough to send the denizens of the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club into a frenzy of indignation.No such outrage occurred. The young American appeared in virgin white from head to toe; only the navyNike'tick' emblem stood out from the gleaming background.To some, pounds 1million a year for swanking around in two pairs of shorts makes running a water company for pounds 200,000 a year seem like slave labour. But the manufacturers paying for a piece of the Agassi action are convinced they are getting value for money.A spokesman forNikein the UK says that the impact of Agassi and John McEnroe's appearances are already increasing sales. 'We have had requests for the shirts they wore, though they are not yet available in the UK. The colourful side of Agassi has been invaluable for us at Wimbledon, and brand awareness has been incredibly high.'&nbsp;Nikecannot put a number on the players sporting its logo at Wimbledon, as it supplies all players without clothing or shoe contracts with equipment for the tourn- ament.Any well-managed player in the top twenty in the world rankings should be turning over millions of dollars, and for any player in the top hundred there is a more than decent living. Mal Washington, who almost pushed Lendl out of Wimbledon, is ranked 60th. In 1990 he earned dollars 150,000, with a similar amount from sponsorships and exhibitions.Agassi is not on Pro Serve's books, but the company shared the general delight at his success. 'The spirit of Agassi is good for tennis and good for sponsors. People will always watch players like Agassi and McEnroe, who is now seen as part of the old guard,' says Jolly. Sponsors will still pay pounds 25,000 per match to have a small patch of the right player, and one German manufacturer sends its scouts to sign up players on the spot if they are playing on a show court or being televised.But sponsors also want to see value for money; players are increasingly asked to participate in 'meet and greet' events run by their paymasters. And while swearing on court is generally good for publicity and profile, overly wayward or immoral behaviour off-court might cost a player a contract.But tennis is not the hot property it once was. In the late 1970s, when McEnroe and Borg had their epic, absorbing struggles, sponsors were more eager to buy into the sport.'Golf is now the hottest property sport by quite a long way', says Jolly. The pastel pants brigade has overtaken the tennis court warriors in the marketability stakes, partly because of the lack of personalities in the past decade.The 'robots' as some unkindly brand them came from a tradition started by Ivan Lendl. Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Jim Courier, and Michael Stich do not have the same crowd-pleasing capacity as McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Vitas Gerulaitis or Ilie Nastase.Wimbledon has, however, lost none of its prestige. Despite the British weather, expensive strawberries and infuriating ticket touts, it is still the two weeks of tennis that can make or break a player's career, and bank balance.",0.131342139596,0.403238747554,1071 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","March 29, 1991, Friday",226 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;I WONDERED why Channel 4 screened Lloyd's Of London at 3.55pm on Sunday - curious timing for a documentary about chicanery in the insurance industry. But presumably they wanted something sensational to enliven the pre-Christmas doldrums of celebrity quizzes and old movies.Despite its lingering reputation as a bastion of pinstriped Britishness, Lloyd's in fact appears to have been a labyrinth of leather-upholstered corruption into which regulators and current chairman David Coleridge are struggling to insert safeguards and renewed credibility. The posher a chap's voice, the deeper in the mire he probably was.&nbsp;Take Ian Posgate, for example. Afflicted with an inbred accent borrowed equally from Lord St John of Fawsley and Wilfrid Hyde-White, Posgate looks and sounds like an archbishop or a professor of ancient Greek literature, but he was heaved out of Lloyd's for unsportsmanlike aggression and for syphoning money into overseas accounts. Former Lloyd's chairman Sir Peter Green, who resembles one of Harry Enfield's bumbling toffs, was fired in 1987 and fined pounds 33,000 for discreditable conduct.This sort of thing was so rife it barely seems to have provoked a raised eyebrow. A common trick was for Lloyd's insiders to form 'Baby Syndicates' of perhaps half a dozen members, using their influence and contacts to funnel lucrative business their way. The larger syndicates featuring the much-publicised 'names' were left to shoulder the everyday mass of business and its potential losses.The names have been up in arms of late, crying foul because they've been called upon to honour their pledge to cover all losses incurred by their syndicates. Most of them signed up with Lloyd's in the expectation of earning fast, easy money, but now they've been painfully reminded of what 'unlimited liability' means. They've fallen foul of insurance swindles, claims from American workers suffering asbestos-related diseases, and the consequences of Lloyd's decision to diversify into 'catastrophe insurance'.Some of them claim they were misled and robbed, and find they have to sell their houses and family silver. But as Mary Archer, who runs Lloyd's Hardship Committee, observed, 'I don't feel terribly sorry for rich people who have lost a fair amount of money. It is a bit like gambling on the horses - you may lose.' The question now is whether the rich will decide insurance is no longer worth a flutter and move their money elsewhere. If they do, it's goodnight Lloyd's. After this expose, one might be tempted to add: 'And good riddance.'The Trainer Wars (Channel 4) probed behind the flashy and hi-tech facades of the global giants of athletic footwear.Nikeare currently top dogs, with a 30 per cent share of the booming American market, with Reebok hyperventilating along just behind.Partly, this was just another story of capitalism red in tooth and claw, to set alongside the Cola and Burger Wars. The days of the humble Dunlop plimsoll or the American canvas baseball boot have been blown away by a blizzard of foot-technology, superstar endorsements, and ruthlessly targeted commercials which make pop videos look like the Test Card.BUT where the whole lot is beginning to gape at the seams is in the ghettos and inner cities, where sportswear-envy has become the regular flashpoint for drive-by killings and gang wars. Suddenly,Nike- who claim, improbably, that they're primarily in sports and fitness, rather than street fashion - find their crusade for the feet and minds of American teenagers has plunged them into the social chaos of an underworld where the major cause of death for black males aged 15-25 is murder, and where black kids on the streets of Chicago's south side are more at risk than soldiers were in Vietnam. A new category of 'sportswear-related deaths' has been invented.ANikead on a street-gang theme was banned in the US, but the company argues it can't be blamed for America's social crisis. Yet it has spent millions promoting its goods as the epitome of all-American health, fitness and success, and has built itself into the grassroots of college and high-school sport, funding summer camps and providing free merchandise to cash-starved campuses.Nikehas created role-models to aspire to and status symbols to acquire.

"&nbsp;I HAVE been reading shoeboxes. Usually I prefer books but a particular shoebox caught my attention. I have been ill since last week and, once I'd let off some bile against the Royal Family, also bored. So I cleared out the cupboard and that's when I found the box. It had once contained a pair ofNikeAir Pegasus trainers, bought at some expense to protect my knees whilst my feet pound the streets and parks of north London. Since the purchase, a week of snow and a week of 'flu had protected my knees very well so I hadn't got much use out of the trainers. The box proved excellent value for money though.&nbsp;Emblazoned on it, along with a lot of other stuff, was the legend 'Just Do It'. Just do what? These three little words, along with their close cousin 'Go For It', are responsible for a great deal of confusion among us New Men as we jog through this vale of tears. I have never known what I am supposed to be just doing and going for. I wish I could find out, because I think I'd be a lot happier and more successful. I suppose it has something to do with either spending money or becoming a health fascist, both of which I try to avoid. It may have something to do with getting a proper job. I hope not. Perhaps someone atNikecan help me.STILL perplexed, I answered the telephone. It's a new telephone, equipped with a squawk-box facility. Very posh. The caller's voice comes out of a loudspeaker and I can reply without picking up the receiver. But technology usually lets you down. The squawk-box doesn't work. My half of any conversation sounds like it's coming from the bottom of a mineshaft. The call was from my friend Marc. 'Hello Marc,' I said, feeling high-powered. 'Pick the phone up, Robert' he said, having met my squawk-box before. So I did. He offered me a lift to Sainsburys to do the shopping. What could New Man do but accept, much as I didn't want to go?I'm glad I did go, because I met Michael Ignatieff Late Show presenter, Observer columnist and recently published novelist. Well, I didn't exactly meet him, more saw him from a distance disappearing down the first aisle (tins, tea and coffee). 'That's Michael Ignatieff,' I said to Marc, trying to sound off-hand. 'You're right,' said Marc, who was genuinely off-hand, probably because he lives with someone much more famous than Michael Ignatieff and prats like me in supermarkets are a constant source of harassment. But there's something about famous people, isn't there? Heedless of my fevered state, I dashed, trolley suspiciously empty, along the second aisle (biscuits and condiments) in order to come back up the first and catch Ignatieff full frontal. I persuaded myself that I wanted to ask him about that weekend's column but was really seized by an irrational desire to see what he had in his trolley. Would he have bought the own-brand soups, the Baxter 69p a tin range or the ultra-posh New Covent Garden Soup Co variety?I never found out. Ignatieff, well disciplined Renaissance New Man, obviously an older hand at the Sainsburys game than I, was too quick for me. In myNikeAir Pegasus trainers, maybe I would have caught him. As it was, he was away to the delicatessen before I turned the corner. Too embarrassed to follow him further, instead I had an argument at the bakery over the custard tart I was buying for the little snack 'Er Outdoors likes when she gets in from her proper job. Such are the travails of New Men.SPEAKING of new men, we had an unlikely recruit to our ranks last week. Up until Friday, I had thought Justin Fashanu was the bravest man in football for revealing he was gay on the front page of the Sun. Anyone who has witnessed the machismo of a football team's dressing room will appreciate that this was a very courageous thing to do. Now his bravery has been equalled by Kenny Dalglish, who came out in a different way when he resigned as manager of Liverpool FC. Dalglish rejected the value system of the world he has been steeped in since signing on for Celtic at the age of 16. For 20-odd years, Dalglish has been Going For It and Just Doing It with incomparable skill. Now it seems maybe even King Kenny didn't know what it was all for either. I hope he finds out.A question in the admirable Junior Gunners section of Arsenal's match programme last Saturday: name at least eight towns in England which have more than two football teams.

"An ad for Diet Pepsi that sent viewers around the world was the world- beater in USA TODAY's Ad Meter survey of Super Bowl commercials.&nbsp;The bubbly soft-drink ad topped the list of 46 Super Sunday ads watched and rated by 55 residents of Arlington, Va., for the third annual Ad Meter. Like many of the other high-scoring ads, Diet Pepsi's 60-second spot rewarded viewers with large doses of star power (singer Ray Charles), humor (monks chanting an ad jingle) and warmth (a singing cowboy and a church choir).&nbsp;''When it started, I thought, 'Here we go again. I've seen this before.' But they were just building up to it,'' said Kerry Tymchuk, 32, a lawyer.If the gulf war had any impact on the Ad Meter audience, it's not evident from the results. The highest ranked ad taking the crisis into account - a Diet Coke ad announcing a $ 1 million donation to the USO - came in ninth. Indeed, the cola warriors took different stances on the war (Story, 1B) - and their Ad Meter showings differ dramatically as a result.Pepsi-Cola Co. aired its original ads but canceled its contest. Coca-Cola USA yanked its original funny ads for serious ones but went ahead with its contest.Ad Meter viewers preferred Pepsi's approach. Of the top four ads, three were Diet Pepsi ads - all the ads that Diet Pepsi ran. And while Diet Coke's USO ad finished ninth, a second ad - to play the ''Crack the code for real refreshment'' game - tied for 22nd. (However, the Ad Meter audience did not have the game pieces for the Coke game.)Other ads rating high were stuffed with sure-fire crowd pleasers, such as celebrities, laughs and good feelings:- A McDonald's Corp. ad spotlighting Mike Sewell, a 19-year-old with Down's Syndrome who works for the fast-food giant in Cary, N.C.''It tugs at your heart,'' said Gwenda Ayres, 34, an accountant.- Two ads for Panasonic that humanized electronics products by showing a small-town parade and youngsters fumbling their way through a peewee football game.- A warm, low-key ad forNikeInc. that saluted the shoe firm's famous athletes. The 90-second ad, launchingNike'sAir 180 line, displayed giant images of Bo Jackson, Michael Jackson and other superstars at play.Nike'sshowing was good for 10th place. The company was the Ad Meter winner in 1990 with a wildly funny spoof of sports and sportscasters.On the other end of the Ad Meter spectrum was Bud Bowl 3. The third annual mega-promotion from Anheuser-Busch Inc. - matching bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light beer in a mock football game - was more a Dud Bowl than a Bud Bowl to Ad Meter viewers.Of six Bud Bowl ads during the game, three landed with a thud among the Ad Meter's bottom four. The highest rated was the Bud Bowl's finale - in which Bud Light won its first Bud Bowl, 23-21. That was 34th.''They're not just silly, they're stupid,'' said Mike Drillings, 45, a psychologist.The Ad Meter audience was randomly selected. While such groups are frequently used for national marketing surveys, the small size (55 people) means the results don't necessarily represent the opinions of all U.S. consumers.",0.0448346560847,0.534877645503,522 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES","October 25, 1991, Friday",230 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"courier business.Coke's message ''sounds a little like moralizing, disapproving of anyone having a good time,'' says Judith Langer, head of the Langer Associates market-research consultancy. The fact that the Super Bowl ''went on was saying we wanted to keep America going as usual and we wanted to have fun.''Langer had a warning for advertisers who like Coke are thinking of creating war-themed ads: The public is ''wary of marketers climbing on any bandwagon, whether it's green (environmental marketing) or pro-war.'' Those who want to pitch patriotically ought to run such ads during war coverage instead of during a festive Super Bowl, she says.Some ads that said hooray for the USA - in a more low-key way - fared better with the Ad Meter viewers. Of five ads run by Panasonic Co., two that spotlighted small-town consumers and their kids ranked fifth and sixth.''Patriotic feelings seemed to be running high,'' said Bob Greenberg, Panasonic's communications general manager. But he noted that Panasonic created the ads before the war began. Like the electronics marketer's other Super Sunday ads, the spots have been airing since October.Panasonic isn't the only advertiser who chose to air previously run spots. Among others: Anheuser-Busch Inc., which aired a patriotic ''Here's to you, America'' ad from the late 1980s, and Master Lock, which ran a torture- test ad it aired during Super Bowl XXIV a year ago.At Anheuser, ''our feeling is not so much, 'Is it new vs. is it old?' but, 'How strong is it? How compelling is it?' '' says Tom Sharbaugh, vice president of Budweiser brands. That's why the beer giant mixed ads of varying ages: the older ''Here's to you'' ad, a current ''Nothing beats a Bud'' ad and the new Bud Bowl 3 ads.Recycling ads is one way to keep down the cost of participating in the Super Bowl, especially as the cost of a 30-second ad keeps soaring: Sunday's $ 800,000 price tag was up a whopping 14.5% from the $ 700,000 charged last year.Still, most marketing titans see the Super Bowl as a showcase that demands the unveiling of blockbuster commercials. Of the 10 ads liked best by the Ad Meter audience, seven made their debuts Sunday.''There are two games that go on. One is in the Super Bowl. The other is in the advertising,'' says David Novak, executive vice president of marketing and sales for Pepsi. Other advertisers who aired all-new ads included Audi of America Inc. andNikeInc.Among other key ad issues on the post-game agenda:- Exclusivity. Some companies are the only ones in their categories to advertise during the game. Anheuser, for instance, is the exclusive beer advertiser.Pepsi, by contrast, prefers to confront its cola-wars opponent within the game. ''We welcome the competition,'' Novak says. ''We believe we always have a great opportunity whenever we go head-to-head with Coca-Cola.'' Indeed, the three Diet Pepsi ads averaged 8.14 with the Ad Meter viewers, vs.  6.68 for Diet Coke's two ads.And L.A. Gear Inc. - another first-time Super Sunday advertiser - was glad that the sneaker wars raged during the game. The No. 3 sneaker firm faced No. 1Nike- each ran one ad - and No. 2 Reebok International Ltd., which ran two ads.''I think (viewers) can sort it out by the creativity of the",0.119458423521,0.533713924964,1366 words,"NIKEJUMPS, LA VANISHES",July 7 1991,231 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Although Adi Dassler made his first gym shoe in 1920, adidas had a puny 4% share of the U.S. market last year - compared withNike's28% and Reebok's 21%.While those giants tweak each other with mild wisecracks in TV ads, Strasser helped create a new adidas Equipment brand that will be rolled out nationally by August with a back-to-basics pitch. One Equipment ad, for instance, says sports isn't about ''greed ... arrogance (or) fashion.''It's a pitch meant to attract baby boomers, many of whom are presumably becoming more sensible at the expense of their fashion sense. The shoemaker will rely on relatively low-key endorsers such as marathoner Grete Waitz. Laughs Strasser: ''The baby boomers are going to set the trends until the last one is dead.''Another underdog, Converse, is relying on a practical pitch: It has launched a new ad campaign with the tagline ''It's What's Inside that Counts''.But last night, adidas and Converse managed to score a conventional marketing coup in their uphill battle against the U.S. sneaker giants. Duke's basketball team wore adidas, Kansas wore Converse.CHEST MATCH: Sam Marion recalls it as ''a hell of an experience.''About 15 years ago, a player on a Little League team Marion managed was hit in the chest - and nearly died being rushed to the hospital.Marion didn't forget. After borrowing heavily, Marion's International Protective Athletic Safety Corp. of Fraser, Mich., developed a $ 70 kids' safety vest suitable for baseball and other sports.Marion's safety vest weighs 1.5 pounds and is made of compressed foam. They're available in about 50 stores so far.They're overdue. The Consumer Products Safety Commission reports 51 baseball-related deaths between 1974 and 1984, and at least 13 in 1989-90. Last Saturday, a 15-year-old New Hampshire hockey player died after being hit with a puck in the chest.Marion says he also has sold the Seattle Mariners on using his $ 80 adult safety jacket in practice. ''It won't be long,'' says ex-major leaguer Lary Sorensen, ''until you see most pro clubs using them.''BLOW OUT: Smokefree Educational Services, a health advocacy group, says it will include Little Leaguers as protesters in an opening day demonstration Monday against the Marlboro billboard in New York's Shea Stadium.

Now, women's water polo hopes to become the latest.The FINA women's water polo World Cup, an eight-nation tournament, continues through Sunday in Long Beach, Calif.&nbsp;U.S. officials are using the event to showcase the sport and boost their campaign to get women's water polo on the schedule of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.''Women have been playing the sport internationally in Europe since 1928, and it's now being played in 35 countries on five continents,'' said former national team player Theresa Breckon, vice president for women with U.S. Water Polo.''We feel we have all the requirements necessary to be an Olympic sport.

"So much for the romance of the road. A new ad campaign for Subaru takes a determinedly realistic, if wry, approach.&nbsp;''You can drive it so fast you'll get so many tickets you'll lose your license,'' warns a magazine ad for the SVX sports coupe. Of course, doing so is ''stupid, dangerous and a waste of precious fossil fuels...  Not to mention the type of person you meet in prison.''This is post-'80 s advertising: pushing reliability and value.''A car is a car,'' says the narrator in ads showing Subaru's assembly line in Lafayette, Ind. ''It won't make you look handsome or prettier or younger, and if it improves your standing with the neighbors, then you live among snobs with distorted values.''The ads are the first for Subaru by its new agency, Portland, Ore.-based Wieden &amp; Kennedy. Subaru's $ 60 million account is the first auto client for the agency, now known mainly for itsNikeInc. campaigns - ''Just do it'' and ''Bo knows.''Nikeis the agency's only other large client.The ads keep Subaru's ''idiosyncratic'' appeal, but are aimed at buyers made value-conscious by a white-collar recession. ''It was not really a repositioning but saying, 'Your time has come,' '' says agency head Dan Wieden. Subaru even got its ownNike-like tag line: ''Subaru.

"A daredevil leaps from a plane with a snowboard strapped to his Reebok Pump cross-trainers. He twists, turns and flips in a demonstration of sky surfing.It's a commercial, but it looks and sounds like the opening of a James Bond movie, right down to the dramatic parachute landing. The message also is worthy of 007: &quot;Life is Short. Play Hard.&quot;&nbsp;That's the cornerstone of Reebok International's new corporate image campaign, the latest attempt by the Stoughton, Mass., athletic shoe manufacturer to latch on to a successful marketing theme, vault out of the No. 2 spot and overtake its rival,Nike.The sky-surfing ad, a 60-second commercial that debuted on Monday Night Football, is one of three new ads created for Reebok by the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency of New York. The second spot, still being produced by the company run by film maker George Lucas, will feature tennis player Ann White hitting balls animated with the faces of annoying people and pets in her life; the third will show tourists in Central America deciding whether to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of a pyramid.The new ads come as Reebok is riding high with the success of its patented Pump technology. The company surprised Wall Street with strong second-quarter sales and effective cost-cutting efforts, including a pay cut for chief executive Paul Fireman.But the question that has dogged Reebok is, when will it find a corporate image, a campaign theme and an advertising agency it can live with for the long haul?For example, the new ads follow a long line of Reebok campaigns that, for a variety of reasons, fell short ofNike'subiquitous &quot;Just Do It&quot; campaign, which achieved the ultimate success: adding a phrase to the common lexicon. As a result, it has become the standard against which others are measured.Among Reebok's also-rans were the &quot;U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which was widely thought to be inspired but too offbeat, and the more recent &quot;Time to Play&quot; ads, which never caught on. Reebok also was caught last year in a controversy with a campaign that depicted bungee jumping, an activity in which participants strap elastic cords to their legs and jump from bridges.At the same time, Reebok has been labeled a revolving-door client by ad agencies. The firm Ammirati &amp; Puris had the account briefly, then it went to Chiat/Day, which produced the bunjee jumping ad. Next was Boston's Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., but that didn't last, and Reebok went back to Chiat/Day. Lois/GGK of New York also was expected to have a piece of the action, but that apparently fell by the wayside.Even company executives acknowledge the fits and starts of the past. But they are pinning their hopes, and for some, their jobs, on the latest effort, which they label a long-term theme.&quot;Reebok has been like a teen-ager,&quot; said David Ropes, the company's new marketing director, who is directing the Life Is Short campaign. &quot;It grew up really fast, was having a lot of fun and trying new things. Now it's decided what it wants to be when it grows up.&quot;Analysts and advertising executives say it will be months before there are clear signs whether the campaign will create a new high- water mark for athletic shoe ads. But most reacted positively to Reebok's approach.&quot;I've seen the line and I like it. In the context of sports, and of trying to have the maximum performance, I think it works,&quot; said Joe Grimaldi, chief operating officer of Mullen Advertising Inc. of Wenham, Mass.Several wondered privately whether Reebok's new theme is more attuned to the go-go 1980s than the presumably more laid-back 1990s. But the consensus was that it would appeal to the active and would-be athletes Reebok is trying to reach, especially if the company doesn't put the campaign on the shelf too soon.&quot;I wouldn't be too literal about the line. It could do for them what 'Just Do It' does forNike. It's a call to action, an invitation to get out there and play some sports,&quot; said Ron Lawner, chairman and creative director at the Lawner Reingold Britton agency in Boston.&quot;It seems they are introducing a campaign idea that they are going to stay with, and I think that's even more important than the campaign itself,&quot; said Steve Encarnacao, Reebok's chief marketing officer from 1985-87, and now chief executive of Stonemark Inc., which produces Carter's children shoes.Encarnacao suggested the new campaign harks back to an early, successful effort by Reebok, entitled &quot;Because Life Is Not a Spectator Sport.&quot;",0.115561475561,0.409402449402,755 words,Valvano set to coachNikestars,"August 15, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",243 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

On Feb. 3, 1990, Concordia ended a five-year, 0-47 losing streak.It's Hickey's second time as head coach of the Stingers. He coached the women's team from 1976 to 1985, during which Concordia reached the CIAU national tournament four times.Upon his return, Hickey said his first priorities were to make the women's program &quot;enjoyable again&quot; and Concordia the class of the Quebec league.He appears to have succeeded on the first matter, but returning Concordia to its previous glory days might take longer than anticipated.",0.125449810606,0.322940340909,466 words,Valvano set to coachNikestars,"September 27, 1991, Friday, FINAL EDITION",244 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Shoes are responsible for the majority of foot deformities and problems that physicians encounter in women.That's the main finding of a U.S. survey by a group of orthopedic surgeons.&quot;It's a real problem; shoe wear has its impacts on women's feet,&quot; says Seattle's Dr. John E. McDermott, incoming president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, the study's sponsor.It's also a problem that results in women being by far the majority of patients visiting orthopedists with foot complaints, McDermott says.&nbsp;Some 80 per cent of the study's 356 women reported foot pain. Count their agonies: bunions, hammertoes, pinched nerves, corns and calluses.And all this from individuals, ages 20-60, who reported no previous foot trauma or surgery and no medical conditions that may affect foot health, like arthritis or diabetes.&quot;There's always been a lot of suspicions and accusations that women's footwear causes a lot of problems, but there were no studies to back up those accusations,&quot; says the report's primary author, Dr. Carol Frey, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Medicine.The study found enough blame to go around, spreading it among shoe manufacturers, retailers, and omen themselves.To begin with, when doctors measured the subjects' feet, they found 88 per cent were wearing shoes too small. But the problem wasn't in the length so much as the width. While the average woman in the study said she was an 8B, in fact she was an 8C.The crunch comes when women try to find dress shoes that fit their heel snugly but leave room for their toes. Although most women have narrow heels, manufacturers commonly give wide shoes wide heels.&quot;For a shoe to give support or help, it has to give you heel control,&quot; McDermott says. To get this, many women buy shoes too tight across the base of their toes.In addition, shoe manufacturers commonly buy their dress-shoe lasts - the form upon which the shoe is modeled - in Asia, where women have narrower feet. The result is a slender shoe, which manufacturers believe U.S. women find more appealing.Style also conspires to cause problems. Is there a woman alive who hasn't painfully regretted buying a pair of cruel shoes, those high-heeled killers that thrust her weight into pointed toes?&quot;The shoe should be longest at the great toe - not in the center of the shoe,&quot; McDermott says. &quot;That's one of the big problems of design. The big toe is pushed over toward the other toes by the shape of the shoe, and you end up with a deformed foot.&quot;Commonly the damage is done gradually, over years and sometimes painlessly, resulting in a bunion at the base of the big toe, a misshapen big toe, and smaller toes that have clawed under and developed calluses on top. These are called hammertoes.In the study, women come in for their share of the blame. Although 60 per cent believed their shoe size had increased since age 20, some 75 per cent had not had their feet professionally measured in five years.Indeed, the women were right about the increase. The doctors found that by age 29, 18 per cent had larger feet. By age 50, 69 per cent had experienced an increase. And by 60, some 95 per cent had larger feet than when they were 20.&quot;Women's feet can go up about a size to a size and a half as they age,&quot; McDermott says. s, it takes about seven years for a manufacturer to make significant changes in shoe fit. Still, Frey says some companies already are realizing the need and trying to fill it.She gives kudos toNike, Easy Spirit, Rockport, New Balance, Naturalizer, and Soft Spots, among others, for trying to make fashionable, well-fitting shoes.Oregon'sNike, in particular, recently bought Cole-Haan, a fashion manufacturer. For several months, Cole-Haan has been selling women's pumps bearingNike'sAir-Sole technology, says John Barbour,Nikeproduct line manager.

"First-time participants who weren't sure what to expect yesterday in the 15th annual Ed Barron Hangover Classic run probably got a good clue as they lined up for the start of the eight-kilometer run around the Reflecting Pool on the Mall.The announcer advised runners who were &quot;pushing a baby carriage or with a dog, or other, I hate to say it, hindrances,&quot; to please run off to the side so as not to impede unencumbered runners.On a glorious crisp, sunny New Year's afternoon, 1,328 men, women and children, and several dogs on leashes and babies in strollers, participated in the run, a fund-raiser for the American Cancer Society sponsored by the Potomac Valley Seniors Track Club. The race was expected to yield a $ 1,300 donation, organizers said.&nbsp;The annual exercise in healthy irreverence is held in honor of former club member Ed Barron, who died of cancer 11 years ago.Jeff Darman, who has organized several races in Washington, including theNikeWomen's Challenge and theNikeCapital Challenge, said the Hangover Classic is more about fun than serious racing.&quot;It's more of a celebration race,&quot; Darman said. &quot;A higher proportion of people are out there to celebrate the New Year, not so much to run their personal best.&quot;While serious runners participate yearly in the Hangover event, it is more informal than many other Washington races, with many runners competing in costumes or forming &quot;centipede&quot; teams in which they run the course linked by ropes or chains.Because of its relatively short distance -- the Marine Corps Marathon is 26.2 miles, for instance -- it is one of the more accessible of Washington's better-known races. In addition, it is not as competitive to enter as some other well known races, such as theNikeCherry Blossom 10-mile road race, which each April draws an international field of top runners and an overflow of applicants for 5,000 coveted slots. The Marine Corps Marathon drew 13,000 runners last fall.The Hangover route started at the Lincoln Memorial playing fields on the west side of the Reflecting Pool, went past the memorial and through the park along Independence Avenue and back to the Reflecting Pool. The course consisted of two laps.The field of participants included grim-faced serious runners, occasional joggers and a few people whose pained expressions suggested they may not be back for the 16th annual classic.And though it was not necessary to be suffering a hangover to compete, a number of participants said they did feel the effects of the previous night's reverie.&quot;Oh man, that's not easy to do after you've been out 'til 3 in the morning,&quot; said D.C. physician Paul Rudolf, moments after completing the 4.97-mile run.Regina Powell, of Bowie, had other worries after completing the race.&quot;I want my mommy,&quot; the 8-year-old said after finishing in about 39 minutes, well ahead of many adults.Regina, who has a running trainer, said she liked the race &quot;a little bit.&quot; Her favorite part? &quot;Going around the pond.&quot;The event kicked off with a costume contest, judged by crowd applause, in which dressing suitable to one's gender appeared to be a disadvantage. The winner in the women's category, Becky Bosley, of Falls Church, sported a Fidel Castro mask and military uniform, while the men's winner wore a black dress, black fishnet stockings, silver-colored beads and running shoes that matched neither the dress nor each other.&quot;I went to a costume shop for the outfit, though the shoes are mine,&quot; said Warren Snaider, of the District, the men's costume winner. Snaider beat out a man dressed in a waiter's outfit who sported a tray with drinks and offered to quench the thirst of anyone who applauded for him.As for the race, Lynn Patterson, of Fairfax, was the first woman to finish, with a time of 28:28.The race was one of the closest ever, with Michael Regan, of the District, edging Trevor Nelson, of Berkeley, Calif., by two seconds. Regan's time was 24:43.Regan said he entered the Hangover because &quot;it seemed like a fun way to start the New Year.&quot;Nelson, who was in town visiting friends, had another motive. &quot;My girlfriend's dad is running, so I figured I'd look good for him,&quot; he said.",0.120408027645,0.402968279284,701 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"August 29, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",247 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Howard Shaffer left a comfortable job with theNikecompany in 1985 to start a new business here in partnership with a sleepy Chinese concern called the Long March Leather Shoe Factory. What happened over the next few years illustrates why industrial output in this region in southern China is now soaring at more than 25 percent per year.Shaffer said he began his joint venture here by insisting on modern, capitalist management techniques and &quot;breaking bad habits&quot; among the Chinese workers, such as sleeping on the job. After just three months, productivity had quadrupled, to about six pairs of shoes per day for each employee from Long March's old level of 1.5 pairs.By the end of the decade, Shaffer had expanded his operations to three factories here, and was making up to 650,000 pairs of shoes a month for such U.S. companies as Timberland, Thom McAn and Stride Rite -- and for his old employer,Nike. His sales in 1990 totaled $ 74 million. Asked about profits, Shaffer just smiled.&nbsp;Welcome to Guangdong Province, the freewheeling, free-market area along China's southern coast that, by local estimates, is currently among the fastest-growing economic regions in the world. A banner in the center of its capital, Guangzhou -- formerly known as Canton -- proclaims in big characters: &quot;Unity, Progress, Friendship.&quot; But a better slogan for the new Guangdong might be: &quot;Money, Money, Money.&quot;Guangdong's real industrial output grew during the 1980s at an average annual rate of 19.7 percent, which analysts here said was by far the fastest of any province in China. The growth rate jumped from that already high level during the past 12 months, to 27.7 percent. The province's savings rate last year was a stupendous 32.8 percent.This booming area won't be on the itinerary of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrives in Beijing Friday to meet with China's hard-line Communist Party leaders. So Baker won't see the economic whirlwind that, in the view of many experts, is transforming southern China despite Beijing's efforts to contain it.Economic reforms were launched here in the late 1970s, when Guangdong was permitted to go &quot;one step ahead&quot; of the rest of China in experimenting with free-market reforms. At first, foreign investment was largely limited to three special zones along the coast -- Shantou, Shenzen and Zhuhai -- but it has spread to most of the province. In the years since, Guangdong's economy has been moving outside the supervision or control of the Communist central government in Beijing. Last year, for example, just 3 percent of the province's total investment came out of the national budget.According to several Westerners here, there are signs that the region may also be moving beyond Beijing's political control.As evidence of Guangdong's growing political independence, analysts here point to the battle that raged last year over the appointment of a new provincial governor to replace Ye Xuanping, a reformer who had reached retirement age. Hard-liners in Beijing wanted to name one of their own, government spokesman Yuan Mu, in the hope that an outsider could slow the province's pace of economic liberalization.But Beijing's bid to install its hard-line candidate failed, according to local political observers. The central government eventually accepted a compromise candidate, Zhu Shenlin, technically an outsider because he was not born in the region, but a resident for 40 years.Guangdong's officials &quot;no longer feel that Beijing can destroy them,&quot; said one Westerner here.Another sign that the Communist Party leadership is grudgingly coming to accept the freewheeling economy here came last month when hard-line Prime Minister Li Peng paid a visit. Li was taken to see the Guangzhou Soap Factory -- a local example of Beijing's current campaign for &quot;revitalization&quot; of state enterprises.Guangdong's pet revitalization project, it turned out, was a joint venture with Procter &amp; Gamble that is producing such items as Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and Oil of Olay for the domestic market. The factory was hugely profitable last year, sending Beijing about $ 19 million in taxes -- or more than three times what the Guangzhou Soap Factory had contributed in its previous 35 years, according to local observers.Li is said to have remarked approvingly at the end of the factory visit, &quot;They are taking Chinese workers and training them to an international standard.&quot; And according to local residents, he later told a meeting of the Guangzhou city leadership: &quot;Reform is the road from which we will not veer.&quot;Guangdong already is far enough down the capitalist road that it would be hard for the province to turn back, even at Li's insistence. The psychology of entrepreneurship has begun to take hold here and residents are aggressively seeking new ways to make money.One local businessman, for example, established a small factory here employing 100 seamstresses from Sichuan Province to make swimsuits, using fabric and patterns imported from Hong Kong. To help expand his operations, he is said to have arranged for a Hong Kong businessman to invest the equivalent of about $ 65,000.Sometimes, according to local observers, the money being invested here from Hong Kong is actually Guangdong money that has been exported to the British colony, then re-imported so it will appear to be foreign investment and qualify for special privileges. This process is known here as creating &quot;false foreign devils.&quot; Other clever Guangdong businessmen have found ways to create &quot;false collectives&quot; to take advantage of special breaks.Even state-run businesses here are trying to get in on the action. An example is the Guangdong Silk Co. In the old days, the company's exports were handled by just one foreign-trade company. Then someone suggested that a little competition would help move the merchandise. In place of the old monopoly, 17 export companies were licensed. The following year, exports tripled, according to one observer of the local business scene.Shaffer, a no-nonsense 43-year-old from New York state, jumped into Guangdong seven years ago with his Taiwanese wife to &quot;prove to ourselves we could do it.&quot; He had initially hoped for financial backing fromNike, but when it fell through he came anyway. &quot;We decided it was time to take a chance,&quot; he said.His management secret, he said, was that he and his Taiwanese managers &quot;worked like madmen.&quot; He explained: &quot;What I changed was every little detail. I taught them exactly how to cement the bottom of the shoes. Not sort of the way, but exactly the way. . . . By the sheer force of our efforts, we got them to do what we wanted.&quot;One of his unexpected problems, Shaffer said, was breaking through the stratification of Chinese society -- in which workers are treated differently depending on their Communist Party credentials and their links with the party-run &quot;work unit.&quot; Shaffer said he tried to foster more egalitarianism -- for example, by having workers and managers eat together, rather than in separate dining rooms.One worry for Shaffer and other investors in this Chinese boom area is the push in the U.S. Congress to withdraw China's most-favored-nation trade status, which allows goods produced here to be sold competitively in American markets.China's trade status survived this year, but Shaffer said the mere threat that it might be withdrawn led one of his customers, Payless shoe stores, to award a contract for 1.5 million pairs of athletic shoes to a company in Indonesia rather than to his firm.The one issue the otherwise garrulous Shaffer won't discuss is the profitability of his company, which he named Sabry Trading Co. -- after his children, Sabrina and Ryan -- in part &quot;because no one would know where it was from.&quot; He said he would prefer not to give any profit figures because to do so would weaken his hand in negotiating with Western buyers.&quot;American manufacturing and Asian manufacturing are very different,&quot; Shaffer said in an interview in his office just off the shop floor. &quot;American manufacturers work on much tighter margins, because labor costs are much higher. The shoe business is not very sophisticated, and there are a lot of risks in starting up a business here. But when things go well, they go real well.&quot;",0.0285313079941,0.291140411471,1386 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"April 13, 1991, Saturday, Final Edition",252 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Early in his sophomore year at Auburn University, Vincent Edward Jackson was on the losing end of a collision, one of the few times a football tackle would get the best of him. His collarbone had been completely sheared from his shoulder, and Jackson suffered massive ligament damage.The injury came in the second game of the Tigers' season. Immediately after surgery, doctors told Jackson he would not play again that year. Only four games later, he was back and stronger than ever. Only a few years later, millions of people around the country would come to know him simply as Bo.It has come to mean magic and power and anything goes, this name Bo. It is slight arrogance backed by unmitigated action and talent. Bo means Just Do It, Did He Really Do That, and please Do It Again.&nbsp;Bo is a phenomenon, evidence of just what nature is capable of making. Bo is professional football with the Los Angeles Raiders and professional baseball with the Kansas City Royals. Bo is scaling 15-foot outfield walls to catch a fly ball the way normal people run up the stairs to grab a ringing telephone. Bo is a huge home run leading off his first all-star game. Bo can fly at warp factor six, but on the football field, Bo prefers the more direct route, just ask Brian Bosworth. Bo knows running people over.And don't forget. Bo knows everything.Bo knows physics. Bo knows rock and roll. Bo knows tennis and Diddley. Bo knows . . .&quot;Bo can do anything,&quot; said Auburn track and field coach Mel Rosen. &quot;As I've told a lot of people, if Bo didn't play football and baseball he would have been a world-class sprinter. He could have made millions running&quot; sprints.And last week it was shown that Bo is human too, though since he won the Heisman Trophy in 1985 his image has suggested anything but. The two-sport star was released on Monday by the Royals for a hip injury he suffered playing for the Raiders. The Royals believe the injury is so severe he might never play baseball again.On Wednesday, informed sources said cartilage damage in the hip is so bad that he will never play football or baseball again.&quot;The cartilage has sort of wasted away&quot; since the injury, the source said. &quot;In reality, he has an old man's arthritic hip.&quot;And on Friday, the New York Yankees, backed by an army of orthopedic specialists, decided it was too risky to claim Jackson off waivers. So did the other 24 major league clubs who followed the Yankees in priority.&quot;We wanted to be able to sign him,&quot; Yankees General Manager Gene Michael said. &quot;We just felt the risk was too great for us.&quot;Quite possibly, the week saw the passing of a living legend. Bo is no longer solely sportingNikecross training shoes, but sporting crutches as well. He has faced and overcome many difficult challenges before -- poverty, for instance -- but this by far is probably his biggest hurdle.&quot;My relationship with Bo . . . it's special,&quot; said Auburn trainer Herb Waldrop, who tended Jackson through all his collegiate bumps and bruises. &quot;We share a lot of private things. I care about him and his future, and I don't want to say anything that would jeopardize his future. It's better for me to just not say anything about if I think he can come back or not.&quot;But what I will say is that a challenge affecting his athletic ability is one thing; a physical disability like he might have, that's another thing. This may be tough for even Bo. But if anyone can come back from it, it's Bo.&quot;&quot;I'm not going to sit here and say he's going to come back,&quot; said Dallas Cowboys fullback Tommie Agee, who was Bo's roommate and running mate at Auburn and spoke with him this week. &quot;But I hope and pray that he will.&quot;Today, and for many days to come, people everywhere are pondering the possibility of life without Bo as athlete.&quot;When it's all said and done, when I'm sitting home, and limping, my knee torn up at the age of 23, these sportswriters and these fans are still going to be up in the stands, ripping someone else. I know what my body can do and what my body can't do -- I know better than anyone else -- and I'm not going to go out and force my body to do some superhuman thing just to please a sportswriter.&quot;-- Bo in his book, &quot;Bo Knows Bo&quot;Monday:This was the day that the seriousness of Jackson's injury really began to become public. But it was Jan. 13 in a Raiders-Cincinnati Bengals NFL playoff game that the tragedy really began. It was then on a breakaway run down the right sideline, a 34-yard gainer, that he injured the hip. The leg was pulled on from behind and, so it now appears, was pulled completely out of the socket.After the game the Raiders' medical staff diagnosed a hip pointer, a rather common football injury without complications.It wasn't until this past Monday that the Royals confirmed what had been speculated over last weekend -- this was much more serious than a hip pointer.Royals' team physician Steve Joyce said Jackson had a fracture dislocation of the left hip and the result was cartilage damage in the hip socket. He felt Bo would not be able play baseball this year and possibly ever again.One hour before the Royals' announcement, Bo appeared with his personal physician, James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center. Andrews said Bo had a &quot;significant injury&quot; and blood flow to the hip is being monitored.&quot;Don't count me out,&quot; Bo said.Andrews still has not given a specific diagnosis of the injury.Tuesday:Bo spent much of his childhood in a tiny town in Alabama called Raimond. At one point, as he relates in his book, he lived with his mother and a total of eight brothers and sisters in a three-bedroom house. The bathroom was an outhouse. Dinner was sometimes nothing more than grits and margarine.&quot;Sometimes at night we used to sit around and talk about his childhood,&quot; said Agee, who blocked for Bo at Auburn. Bo says Agee is the main reason he won the Heisman.&quot;He went through some incredible things,&quot; Agee said.Now, Bo is wealthy. And much of his money comes from the creativeNikeadvertising that made Bo a household name. Many people know Bo more from the &quot;Bo knows . . . &quot; commercials than from his athletic exploits.But there is the possibility that the injury could hurt Jackson'sNikecontract. Asked if the injury could cost Bo money should he be forced to retire, Liz Dolan,Nikevice president and director of corporate communications, said, &quot;I don't want to say yes or no because it's still early.&quot;Meanwhile, Bo cleaned out his Royals locker. And cried.&quot;I still have my home, my family,&quot; he said. &quot;Business deals down the road. Starting a family business, that's in the works. I'm not really dependent on baseball at this point.&quot;I love the sport. I'd love to play until I'm 70, but that's not possible. I won't pull a [Jim] Palmer and try to come back when I'm 45. When the Man Upstairs says it's over, it's over.&quot;Wednesday:Bo went fishing.It's one of his favorite loves -- second perhaps only to running.&quot;One, he feels frustrated,&quot; said Dick Schaap, who co-authored Bo's book and speaks with him frequently. &quot;Two, he's angry at himself for allowing himself to be hurt. I think that's a natural reaction for any athlete to have.&quot;Thirdly, the thing he misses more than anything else is running. Running is his love and passion. It's something he has done all of his life. And now he can't do it. He can fish, but he can't run.&quot;Thursday:It was reported more strongly that Bo may never be able to play professional sports again, something his agent, Richard Woods, disputed.Without an adequate blood supply, the cartilage in the hip begins to die, a condition called chondrolysis. Cartilage rarely grows back and in the few cases when it has, Harvard Medical School's Lyle Micheli said, it happened in athletes age 16 to 18. Jackson is 28.&quot;The fact there is a great interruption in his career,&quot; Schaap said, &quot;it's a loss for a lot of people.&quot;Friday:No team in baseball proved willing to take a risk and claim Bo off waivers. The Yankees had the first chance because of their record last year, worst in the Royals' league, the American. Many expected the Yankees -- who have taken gambles with less talented players -- to file their claim. But even the Yankees, who drafted Jackson out of high school in 1982 and considered trading for him a few years ago, wouldn't touch Bo. They said six orthopedic specialists told them not to. Not with a $ 2.375 million contract for 1991, the one he and the Royals agreed upon in February when they didn't know how badly he was damaged, to be picked up with him.Said Woods: &quot;I talked with Bo and I told him I thought he would be picked up by the Yankees. But I told him that there was a chance he would not be claimed, and he was not shocked when no one did.&quot;The waiver price was $ 1 and 25 teams looked at $ 2,375,001 and said, &quot;No.&quot;Saturday:Now people wonder what is ahead. Will Bo no longer be Bo, the man who showed us that so much more is possible than we imagined? Will he be able to show us one more time?&quot;I think that he has always shown in the past that there is nothing he likes better than a clear challenge,&quot; said Schaap. &quot;He has spent most of his life and most of his career proving people wrong. He would like nothing better than to come back and hit a home run against the Royals.&quot;&quot;Bo being the type of person he is, he didn't want to leave Kansas City in that fashion,&quot; said Agee. &quot;That's not how Bo wants to leave the scene.&quot;Bo is one of a kind. Not too many come around like Bo, and not many more will come around like Bo.&quot;",0.120025647868,0.438725142818,1606 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"May 25, 1991, Saturday, Final Edition",253 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Baseball and football star Bo Jackson delighted a group of high school journalists yesterday stories about his rise to fame and comments on his career.Jackson held a news conference for the students atNikeTown, the new shoe store opened last fall byNikeInc., one of Jackson's advertising employers.&nbsp;Jackson continually spoke with wonder about how a poor boy from rural Alabama could grow up and become a rich, famous man. &quot;A nappy-headed kid who threw rocks better than some people could shoot a gun,&quot; is how Jackson described himself then, and a family man who loves children is how he sees himself now.A charmerWith two of his own children watching from a balcony above, Jackson charmed the group with an easy demeanor - a contrast to his sometimes shy and surly dealings with professional media.Jackson walked in toNikeTown wearing an earring and a sweatsuit. As soon as he started joking about the &quot;nice, sunny city of Portland,&quot; he put the students at ease.When asked to introduce his family, Jackson said his oldest son was nicknamed &quot;Spud,&quot; his younger son was &quot;a human tornado,&quot; and his infant daughter decided herself not to fly to Portland because of an ear infection.Jackson's humor continually broke through a deadpan delivery and a grave expression. A student asked what Jackson wanted to be remembered for, and the response was a furrowed brow, a glare and a mock-serious:&quot;Am I going anywhere I should know about?&quot;Some of the questions were facile:Which is Jackson's favorite TV commercial?&quot;The last one I did, the multisport Jackson. They wedged me in that sports car, and it took three people to pull me out. The Indy 500 is not in my future.&quot;Some were serious:What about the use of steroids in sports?&quot;I don't know anything about that. I would not know what a steroid is if you came up here and smacked me in the face with it. Go ask (sprinter) Ben Johnson about that. Bo don't know steroids.&quot;Enjoys his workAnd some were obvious:Which sport do you enjoy more, football or baseball?&quot;You wouldn't believe how many times I've been asked that.

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a visit to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, the other day I found myself reflecting upon what a bittersweet experience it has become to see wild animals in captivity.While this zoo is considered to be among the finest in the United States, most of the species in it are threatened, endangered or already extinct in the wild.Lately, I've been keeping track of Associated Press reports on the subject of how the human race is treating earth's wild creatures. You may not be surprised to learn that much of the news ranges from bad to horrifying.&nbsp;A few examples. . .* Charles &quot;Bart&quot; Bartholomew, owner of the 160-acre Texoma Hunting Wilderness near Bennington in southern Oklahoma, has been jailed for six months for cruelty after an estimated 200 animals, all protected under state or federal laws, were killed at the preserve.The animals, including grizzly bears, black bears, elk, deer and cougars, were kept in cages so small that they could barely fit inside, and deprived of adequate food and water.Hunters paid up to $6,000 to have an animal released from its cage into a fenced-in field, where it was shot. One tame bear was enticed to follow a trail of marshmallows, and was killed as it bent to pick one up.* The world's largest oceanarium, Shedd Aquarium, opened recently in Chicago. Audiences sit on seats carved out of a man-made cliff and watch dolphins and beluga whales perform.Aquarium spokesperson Betsey Raymond said, &quot;We want visitors to gain an appreciation of the fragility of the northwest coast environment.&quot;Some of the oceanarium's residents have already learned that particular lesson. The belugas were captured from Churchill River in Canada, and the dolphins from Monterey Bay off California.* A dolphin named Pollyanna has died at Ocean World in Fort Lauderdale. She was captured in 1966 near the Florida Keys, and spent the rest of her life in a tank the size of a backyard swimming pool.Ocean World has been the target of many protests, as well as a federal investigation into animal abuses. A larger dolphin pool is currently under construction.* Teneiya, a condor chick, has hatched at the Los Angeles Zoo, and is believed to be the 50th California condor in existence. These huge carrion-eating birds, with wingspans of almost 10 feet, are almost extinct in the wild. Directly and indirectly, human predators are the reason.Many condors died of lead poisoning after swallowing shot while eating dead game.* The world population of endangered whooping cranes has apparently suffered a record winter loss. According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, 12 of the 146 cranes counted last fall have died or disappeared. About 50 years ago, when the birds were rescued from extinction, there were only 16 left.The whoopers spend the winter at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge along the Texas Gulf Coast, and the summer at Wood Buffalo National Park in northwestern Canada.* In northwestern Zimbabwe, paramilitary police recently shot to death four poachers, part of a gang known to have killed at least five black rhinos in the Hwange wildlife preserve. Since 1984, Zimbabwean police have killed more than 90 poachers.* Last but not least, Greenpeace has singled out Antarctic research stations abandoned by Britain, Chile and Argentina as the &quot;most disgusting&quot; of a bad lot.

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIMBLEDON - Leave it to Andre Agassi.Or perhaps, to be more accurate,Nike.First, the swashbuckling Las Vegan turns the stuffy tennis world on its ear with his tousled tie-dyed hair and stone-washed denim shorts. Not satisfied with this tradition-flaunting attire, he then - with the blessing ofNike,his clothier of record - adds Day-Glo cycling shorts and crop-topped shirts.&nbsp;Then, just when purists have reluctantly started to resign themselves to this godawful apparition, the born-again Agassi embraces . . . tradition.In keeping with his image as a creature of extremes, for his maiden appearance yesterday at centre court at the All England Club the clean-shaven Agassi wore (gasp) white.White warmup suit. White crop-topped shirt. White shorts with white lycra cycling shorts. White socks. White tennis shoes. White headband.A contrast was Grant Connell, Agassi's Canadian-born opponent who was also dressed byNike.He looked like a peacock - even though he conformed to Wimbledon's &quot;predominantly white&quot; clothing rules. That is to say, the Vancouver southpaw's shoes had jade green markings and his first shirt was splashed with blue and hot pink.At 3:45 p.m., Agassi, swathed in a white nylon warmup suit, arrived on centre court to a swell of applause from a gallery that included the Duchess of Kent.Milking the occasion for all it was worth, Agassi went over to his chair and slowly, like a stripper, began to disrobe. As he took off his pants, revealing his white look, there were wolf whistles, cheers, applause.When rain began again at 5:08 p.m., washing out play for the rest of the day with but a meager six matches completed, Agassi and Connell were level at one set each and 1-1 in games in the third. The No. 73-ranked Connell took the first 6-4 and the fifth-seeded Agassi the second 6-1.In what had to be most distracting and intimidating circumstances, Connell did himself proud. He kept his poise, served and volleyed well and moved confidently on the slippery grass. He broke Agassi in the seventh game, then conceded just three more points on his own serve en route to claiming the first set.Agassi, who had not played a grass court match since losing in the first round here in 1987, started out looking uncomfortable on the unfamiliar turf but grew increasingly comfortable and aggressive as the match progressed. By the second set, he'd harnessed his errant first serve and begun whaling his returns of serve, racking up 16 winners, and broke Connell twice to build a 5-0 lead. When Agassi is firing at that level, no one can blunt his attack.But while Agassi had the momentum when play stopped, he is vulnerable on grass. There is no evidence that his volleying has improved. He still tends to wind up and take a big swing in mid-court, rarely comes in to crowd the net, rarely opts to come in to volley off his serve. In other words, he has made few adjustments to his normal hard-hitting style to accommodate the vagaries of grass.He might beat Connell. But he's won't be a serious contender for the men's title.Connell is not throwing in the towel. Having put to rest his pre- match jitters and having had some time to assess the match, he's not pessimistic that he can come back and win - weather permitting.&quot;It was a great feeling. I loved it. But he's damn good, so I have to get in my first serves and then it's down to two out of three.&quot;In other matches, top-seeded defending champion Stefan Edberg finally finished the match he started Tuesday, defeating Swiss Marc Rosset 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Eight- seeded U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras won his first Wimbledon match - 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 over Brazilian Danilo Marcelino - and sixth-seeded German Michael Stich removed American Dan Goldie 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.None of the other Canadians finished.

"WHEN BBDO/Los Angeles abruptly resigned the $60 million L.A. Gear account on Friday after only a little more than two months on the job, many industry executives were not surprised.The relationship was probably doomed from the start, some executives said. L.A. Gear, the country's third-largest athletic shoe company, afterNikeand Reebok, had been creating its own ads for years. Except for a two-week stint with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the company had never worked with an established agency like BBDO. One of the country's biggest agencies, BBDO creates ads for Apple Computer, Pepsi and General Electric.&nbsp;BBDO cited fundamental creative differences as the cause of its resignation.For its part, L.A. Gear said it thought everything had been going just fine. Sandy Saemann, a founder of L.A. Gear and an executive vice president, said the company was shocked by BBDO's resignation.BBDO had been hired as a creative consultant, but agency executives said the problem was that L.A. Gear simply did not want any advice. L.A. Gear still insisted on controlling every aspect of its advertising, they said, and would not allow BBDO to hire commercial production companies, directors or film editors it had successfully used for other clients.These executives said they found one L.A. Gear practice particularly irksome: The company was said to order top agency executives to come over for meetings, then keep them waiting for several hours while L.A. Gear executives attended to other business.But the agency executives said the final blow came when L.A. Gear insisted on using a commercial for its new Catapult shoe that BBDO executives thought was inappropriate. The commercial was first shown during the telecast of the Super Bowl.Steve Hayden, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO/Los Angeles, said the agency was particularly unhappy that L.A. Gear insisted on using the theme line &quot;Everything else is just hot air&quot; in the Catapult commercials. The agency had advised L.A. Gear not to use the theme, which takes a swipe atNikeand its spokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls professional basketball team.In addition, Mr. Hayden said the agency had also told L.A. Gear that the Asics Tiger Corporation, a Japanese athletic shoe company, was using the &quot;hot air&quot; line in commercials in California.Both NBC and CBS refused to run the ad, saying it was an unsubstantiated potshot at a competitor. NBC later reversed its decision.&quot;We thought the commercial was a cheap shot,&quot; Mr. Hayden said. &quot;We saw it as a public relations gimmick, and that is not our style.&quot;Mr. Hayden also said the advertising for L.A. Gear that was being presented as BBDO's work had been substantially altered by L.A. Gear and was &quot;not up to BBDO's standards.&quot;In his statement, Mr. Saemann said the Catapult commercial had been one of the company's most effective ads. &quot;We see the Catapult commercial as a pivotal point in the evolvement of our company,&quot; he said. &quot;We feel we know our audience best and chose to override some of BBDO's creative decisions.&quot;L.A. Gear would not say whether it would seek another agency.The company has indicated that it will fight a patent infringement lawsuit filed last week in Federal District Court in Los Angeles byNike,which contends that the Catapult shoe infringesNikepatents for a heel spring and lace system.",0.183107864358,0.493532261389,564 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 8, 1991, Saturday, SATURDAY SECOND EDITION",262 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Reebok International abruptly pulled its $40 million account from Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos yesterday and split the business between the New York agencies Chiat/Day/Mojo and Lois/GGK.Reebok would not comment on its reasons for dismissing Hill, Holiday, a move that comes a little less than a year after the Boston agency won the account in a highly publicized review. But agency executives said Reebok had made the move because Hill, Holiday's ads failed to create any excitement for the company's athletic shoes and failed to gain ground onNike,which is No. 1.&nbsp;Executives at Hill, Holiday would not comment. The agency had produced only one big campaign for Reebok. With the tagline &quot;It's time to play,&quot; the ads showed athletes and others playing in their Reeboks.Some agency executives said Reebok had become desperate to find a hard-hitting campaign to use against the comparative ads from some of its competitors, and it turned to Lois/ GGK late last year to produce commercials for its &quot;pump&quot; shoes.&nbsp;'They Created a Buzz'The campaign from Lois/GGK, called &quot;Pump up and Air out,&quot; featured athletes taking a swipe atNike'sspokesman, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association, and the maker's Air Jordan shoes. The campaign was criticized by its competitors and some agency executives because it took what they said was an unwarranted potshot at Mr. Jordan.Bernadette Mansur, a spokeswoman for Reebok, said the company was pleased with the ads from Lois/ GGK. &quot;They created a buzz about Reebok with retailers and consumers,&quot; she said.Although Chiat/Day had resigned the bulk of the Reebok account in January 1990 after it was put in review, the agency has continued to create advertising for the company's Weebok's children's shoes and for its business outside the United States.Agency executives said Reebok was a difficult client. The company demands innovative approaches, they said, but then often criticizes an agency for &quot;being too creative.&quot;Chiat/Day, which had the entire Reebok account for three years before the bulk of it went to Hill, Holiday, lost the account in large part because of its quirky &quot;Reebok lets U.B.U.&quot; campaign, which Reebok executives reportedly thought was too far out.The commercials showed people doing idiosyncratic things like vacuuming a carpet on a lawn. The ads were criticized within the advertising industry for not focusing on the performance of the athletic shoes and for not increasing sales. While Chiat/Day had the account, Reebok lost its No. 1 position toNike.Now that Reebok is back, Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive worldwide of Chiat/Day/Mojo, said he was pleased. &quot;It's great,&quot; he said. &quot;Clients don't often return to an agency.&quot;Reebok is the latest in a number of clients who have split their accounts between agencies to double their chances of getting good work. During the last several years both Burger King and I.B.M. have divided their business.Although this setup could obviously foster competitive rivalries, George Lois, the chairman and chief executive of Lois/GGK, said he was not worried. &quot;There is no reason we can't be a great team,&quot; he said. &quot;Agencies are going to have to become comfortable with these kinds of arrangements, because it's obviously a direction more clients are moving in.&quot;",0.0645903843631,0.534791420701,561 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 8, 1991, Saturday, SATURDAY EDITION",263 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"After more than 70 years in the sneaker business, Converse Inc. is pinning its future on five words.Caught flatfooted in the great sneaker war of the 80's, the company has been eating the dust raised byNike,Reebok and L.A. Gear for five years. Using glitzy, celebrity-studded commercials to push one new line of high-performance sneakers after another, the Big Three have grabbed two-thirds of the athletic shoe business while helping to triple its size, to $5.6 billion annually in the United States. Meanwhile, Converse, hobbled by a scattershot approach to marketing, has been stuck with a 2 percent share.&nbsp;Now the company is gambling $22 million on a new ad campaign built around the slogan, &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts.&quot; The campaign, which begins Thursday, is designed to highlight the company's long tradition of making solid, if unexciting, sneakers -- at a price lower than the Big Three.The campaign, which features basketball stars Larry Bird and Bernard King, is particularly important to Converse, which has recently been operating in the troubled shadow of its parent, Interco Inc. The St. Louis-based furniture and footwear company, weighed down with debt in fighting off a hostile takeover 1988 attempt, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.The Boston-based advertising agency that is producing the commercials, Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, has a lot riding on the campaign as well. The second-largest agency in New England after Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., IQ&amp;J has represented Converse for eight years and counts it as one of its most important national clients. Although IQ&amp;J largely escaped blame for past marketing failings -- Converse says a lack of direction on its own part was the chief villain -- the agency is under intense pressure to deliver the goods with the new campaign. Just last Friday, the point was underscored when Hill, Holiday lost its Reebok account.How Converse and IQ&amp;J worked together is a tale of creative chaos, tight deadlines and taut nerves. The three-month the effort tested the resources -- and the patience -- of client and agency both.The effort began in earnest last September. Gordon Tucker, Converse's fourth marketing director in as many years, had concluded a summer of research with a list of adjectives that encapsulated consumer and trade perceptions of the company's major products, which include Magic Johnson basketball shoes and Chuck Taylor All Stars.The company had been marketing its brands separately, diluting the impact of the Converse name. The adjectives -- confident, passionate, hard-working, tough, selfish and genuine -- were to be used as guidelines for pushing the Converse name itself, particularly with the key buying group, teen-agers.IQ&amp;J assigned two creative teams to the project to compete in coming up with the campaign, a traditional industry practice. The teams were a study in contrasts.One paired Don Pogany, a copywriter who recently left the agency, with Peter Favat, an art director. Both men wear faded blue jeans to work; Mr. Favat accents his with cowboy boots and a small gold earring. They had made ads before for Converse, marked by fast-paced editing and clever punch lines.The second team, new to the Converse account, consisted of Mike Sheehan, in the copywriter slot, and Robert Rich as the art director, both of whom are more conservative in dress and taste. They favor a simple, direct approach in their ads.While some agencies devise campaigns on their own and present finished ideas to clients, IQ&amp;J executives prefer to hold a series of sessions in which they show their work in progress. At these, the &quot;tissue meetings,&quot; concepts are explored through drawings on tissue paper.&quot;Involving the client in the creative process means there are no surprises,&quot; said Bruce Kelley, IQ&amp;J's president.The first meeting was scheduled for Nov. 13. Mr. Tucker wanted a finished campaign idea by the end of that month, in time for Converse's annual sales meeting on Dec. 2.The two creative teams plowed through newspapers, magazines and books looking for sports images. They devised three potential campaigns, tried to eliminate one but finally decided to present all three.The morning of the first tissue meeting was cold even by Massachusetts standards. About a dozen executives met in a cramped conference room at Converse headquarters in North Reading, Mass., about 20 miles north of Boston. The atmosphere was casual. IQ&amp;J's executive creative director, Christine Chamberlin, explained the ground rules: a first tissue meeting was meant to be a broad review, a place to discard concepts the client didn't like.The agency opened with &quot;Worn in the USA,&quot; which everyone agreed was the wildest but weakest idea. Mr. Favat turned on a boom box and danced around the room in flawless imitation of a team mascot at a half-time show. The campaign, he said, would depict fans of a high school football team readying themselves for the game. Mr. Tucker laughed, but it was clear he didn't take the approach seriously.Then came a campaign built around a school locker room. One ad closed with a voice reminiscing, &quot;The moments are temporary but some things are permanent. Converse -- some things never wear out.&quot;To present the third concept, &quot;The Original,&quot; Mr. Sheehan also took his audience inside a school locker room. A coach tossed boxes of Converse sneakers at his players. &quot;We play as a team, we dress as a team,&quot; he tells them. The tagline: &quot;Converse -- The Original.&quot;Mr. Tucker asked the agency people which approach they preferred and Mr. Kelley pushed hard for &quot;The Original.&quot;&quot;It shows there is us and there is them,&quot; Mr. Kelley said, explaining that it set Converse apart from other brands with its &quot;pre-emptive statement&quot; that it was the original sneaker. Mr. Tucker was unconvinced, arguing that such a distinction had little meaning outside the industry. But he liked the idea of associating Converse with the timeless moments and youthful exuberance of sports. &quot;Sports teach kids about values,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That image fits us.&quot;The four members of the creative teams smiled politely like small children chastised by their mothers.The second tissue meeting was scheduled at IQ&amp;J's offices for 5:30 P.M. on Nov. 20, two days before Thanksgiving. The meeting started about an hour late because the agency people simply couldn't agree on what to present. Some thought Mr. Tucker's suggestion of associating sports with values was hokey. Some felt Converse needed to outdo the stylized approach of other sneaker companies. Some refused to give up on &quot;The Original.&quot;Mr. Kelley tried to start the meeting off on a positive note by introducing an idea for a new Magic Johnson billboard. Mr. Tucker hated it. The agency then tried to salvage &quot;The Original&quot; theme. Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Rich had discovered that several Larry Birds were listed in local phone books. They envisioned ads asking &quot;What is an original?&quot; in which these noncelebrities would discuss their feelings about sports. But the consensus was that the idea closely resembled Reebok's unsuccessful &quot;UBU&quot; (you-be-you) campaign from a couple of years earlier.Ms. Chamberlin addressed Mr. Tucker's values issue head-on with an idea entitled &quot;Stand for Something.&quot; She offered examples of coaches lecturing athletes on the sins of being late to practice and letting the team down. Mr. Tucker politely suggested it was too preachy.After four hours, Mr. Tucker was frustrated. The agency had presented a jumble of ideas. He liked the regular guy approach and was still attached to looking inside the minds of young athletes and examining their feelings about sports. Ms. Chamberlin told her staff to enjoy Thanksgiving and come in over the weekend.But early on Monday, the 26th, Ms. Chamberlin told IQ&amp;J's chairman, Richard C. Garrison, that her staff was still at odds.Mr. Garrison drove to Converse's offices in an attempt to buy more time. Mr. Tucker refused. Mr. Garrison then vowed that by the time Mr. Tucker left Friday for his sales meeting in Miami, IQ&amp;J would have sold him a finished campaign.Mr. Garrison returned to IQ&amp;J and tersely told the Converse team they needed to stop bickering and find an answer.The next day, the group went back to its list of 300 taglines and finally saw what it had been looking for. &quot;It's What's Inside That Counts&quot; had been analyzed, re-analyzed and finally dumped shortly before the previous meeting. Now, it fit the bill. It addressed the values issue that Mr. Tucker insisted upon. And the word &quot;inside&quot; gave Converse an opportunity to sell specific product benefits of its shoes.Armed with the tagline, the creative teams dusted off the second version of &quot;The Original&quot; campaign, devising a number of ads featuring noncelebrities talking about sports. (The focus ultimately changed to celebrities discussing their lives.) The campaign's tone belonged to the Sheehan-Rich team. The proposed look -- including a reliance on fast-paced editing -- came from Mr. Pogany and Mr. Favat.Mr. Garrison called Mr. Tucker to say the agency had found the answer. Privately, he and Mr. Kelley kept their fingers crossed.Mr. Tucker arrived at IQ&amp;J at precisely 8 A.M. on Friday, and two hours later he bought the campaign. When he left, he found a limousine with champagne waiting at the curb, courtesy of Mr. Garrison, to take him to the airport.It was Mr. Tucker's turn to sell the campaign, to Converse's president, Gilbert Ford. On Saturday, Mr. Ford signed on. On Sunday, so did the sales force. Now, after nearly four months of production, the question is whether the public will sign on, too.&nbsp;MAKING IT -- OFF MAD. AVE.Richard C. Garrison, the chairman and chief executive of Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, is determined to hold onto the Converse account, which, after Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and T. J. Maxx, a national chain of discount apparel stores, is the biggest client at the Boston-based agency.Moreover, Mr. Garrison wants to use the new Converse campaign as a national showcase for IQ&amp;J.&quot;The creative element of the advertising is particularly powerful in the sneaker wars,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to deal with accounts that have high-quality brand names and high visibility as national players.&quot;Mr. Garrison's notion of national prominence does not include moving out of Boston, however. Although many regional agencies expand by opening offices in other cities, Mr. Garrison believes national accounts will come to him.He wants his firm to remain a single office focusing on large accounts in the Northeast corridor and linking up with international agency networks at his clients' request. He dubs IQ&amp;J a mini-network because it provides a range of communications services -- public relations, design and direct response -- in addition to advertising.IQ&amp;J's turbulent recent history makes Mr. Garrison leery of rapid expansion. In 1986, Quinn &amp; Johnson/BBDO, a small Boston subsidiary of the large New York agency, BBDO Inc., bought 80-year-old Ingalls Associates to create Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson. But then BBDO merged with two other mega-agencies, Doyle Dane Bernbach of New York and Needham Harper Worldwide of Chicago, to form the Omnicom Group, which had $8.4 billion in billings last year.The 42-year-old Mr. Garrison, who had become president of the combined IQ&amp;J, quickly discovered he was a very small fish in a huge pond. So in February 1989, he and four partners borrowed $4.5 million to purchase IQ&amp;J. The five felt that conflicts of interest with Omnicom accounts restricted the agency's growth. Since the firm became independent, its total billings have grown 14 percent, to $134 million last year.Freedom also allowed Mr. Garrison to infuse the agency with an entrepreneurial spirit. &quot;There's a lot of screaming and yelling and passion flowing in the halls,&quot; Mr. Garrison says with a mischievous grin. &quot;But we don't have that many jerks.&quot;",0.0954269907724,0.465758099722,2001 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 28, 1991, Friday, ME2",264 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"ROBERT Y. GREENBERG sold wigs, roller skates and shoe laces before founding L.A. Gear Inc. in 1985, and since then he has sold enough sneakers to make the company third in the athletic footwear market, behindNikeand Reebok. But having been battered recently by poor merchandising and marketing and a weak economy, Mr. Greenberg said last week that L.A. Gear is now trying to sell a &quot;substantial&quot; minority stake in the company in what analysts say is an effort to keep it afloat.Over the last few years, L.A. Gear was one of the fastest-growing companies in the country. Sales grew from $70.6 million in 1987 to $902.2 million last year behind Mr. Greenberg's strategy of offering a cross between the performance athletic shoes ofNikeand Reebok and a fashion shoe. But then, analysts said, Mr. Greenberg's fashion sense deserted him. The company got caught with an excessive inventory heading into the recession. And Mr. Greenberg may have compounded his problems by competing directly withNikeand Reebok in performance shoes.&nbsp;L.A. Gear moved earlier this year to slash its payroll, and Mr. Greenberg promised to forgo his $1.5 million salary until the company moved out of the red for a full quarter. A spokesman said Mr. Greenberg, who is 51 and owns a 20 percent stake in the company that is currently worth more than $40 million, was traveling and not available for comment.Kevin J. Ventrudo, chief financial officer, said suggestions that L.A. Gear is struggling to survive are way off the mark and that new products and marketing would allow it to keep growing. Even so, some analysts question whether any new minority owner and the company's banks will let Mr. Greenberg continue to call the shots.",-0.0143939393939,0.337337662338,289 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 28, 1991, Friday, METRO EDITION",265 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"The high school coach saw a future for his slow, frail point guard that had nothing to do with professional basketball or the United States Olympic team. The kid reminded him of himself, years before, a 5-foot-9-inch scrapper just grateful for the chance to play, be it at a blip in the college basketball universe known as Henderson State.Donald Wayne's coach at that tiny Arkansas college, Donald Dyer, had since moved on to Central Arkansas, a power in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Wayne had ended up in Hamburg (population 3,000) in the southeastern corner of the state. Now he placed a call to Dyer to sell him on Scottie Pippen, his 5-11, 145-pound scholarship-less senior.&nbsp;The coach from the nearest state campus, at Monticello, had already told Pippen, sorry, no vacancies. South Arkansas University in Magnolia sent him home after a tryout.&quot;Last shot,&quot; Wayne said of his call to Dyer, who said he, too, had filled his incoming class.Wayne kept talking. &quot;What the heck, send him up,&quot; Dyer said.This was June 1983. Pippen arrived with a sales pitch that went no further than &quot;Yes, sir. No, sir.&quot; He worked out for Dyer, then sat himself in the coach's office and let his older brother, Billy, do the talking.&quot;I can offer you work-study,&quot; Dyer said, finally.&quot;You mean team manager?&quot; big brother Billy asked.As the younger Pippen had experienced no difficulties serving as the manager for Hamburg's football team, dispensing soap and towels as he would the basketball, this was not the insult another player might have taken it to be.Scottie Pippen took the job, and that is how he got to college, last stop before the Chicago Bulls.&quot;Best evaluation of talent I ever made,&quot; said Donald Dyer.&quot;You could make hundreds of dollars playing professional basketball, son,&quot; Scottie Pippen is told at the end of his newNikecommercial, which places him inside a black-and-white, 1940's basketball setting. The commercial was shot in Los Angeles and made its debut during Game 1 of the World Series.&quot;I've come a long way from my first commercials,&quot; Pippen said.Which were?&quot;City Chevrolet of Chicago,&quot; he said. &quot;And Mr. Submarine.&quot;This endorsement business, of course, is relative. Eight years ago, long before his recent five-year, $18 million contract extension and selection to the 1992 United States Olympic team, the tax bracket promised Pippen in theNikecommercial would have bordered on fantasy.Last February, before the Bulls won the franchise's first N.B.A. championship and he played shockingly effective defense in the finals against the Lakers' Magic Johnson, Pippen wasn't even one of 24 N.B.A. All-Stars in Charlotte, N.C.But the 26-year-old Pippen has made the strangest leaps across daunting canyons. If high school to college was unconventional, then how unlikely was his long jump from Central Arkansas to the first round of the National Basketball Association draft in 1987? Seattle picked him fifth over all and then shipped his rights to the Chicago Bulls for another first-rounder, Olden Polynice.Pippen's best friend on the Bulls, power forward Horace Grant, was also a first-round pick by Chicago that year, out of Clemson. &quot;Never heard of him or his school,&quot; Grant said.Pippen then set out on what would become his most spectacular rise. If Michael Jordan with the ball in midflight is beyond description, then Pippen's occupation of neighboring air space is beyond N.B.A. logic. Here is a midsize player who has elevated himself from complete unknown to universally recognized superstar and has done so in the shadow of the most devastating midsize talent the sport has ever produced.&quot;He's one of the stars of this league now,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;He should be treated accordingly.&quot;A person familiar with the United States Olympic selections, while requesting anonymity, said that Pippen was the fourth player chosen, behind Jordan, Patrick Ewing and David Robinson. Pippen interpreted his selection to mean he had &quot;arrived, basically speaking.&quot; Bulls Coach Phil Jackson speaks more expansively. &quot;The reason we were able to win the championship last year was the development of Scottie Pippen,&quot; he said.The Bulls lost two games in four playoff series, with Jordan and Pippen carving up opposing defenses and the outdated thinking of building championship teams around a franchise center, from the inside out. The quick and versatile, they demonstrated, had inherited the hardwood.At 6 feet 8 inches and 215 pounds, angular and muscular, Pippen has grown into the prototypical N.B.A. small forward without surrendering the instincts and skills of a guard. &quot;What people may not yet realize is that what we have here is a Julius Erving-type player,&quot; Jackson said.That name comes to mind when Pippen is attacking the lane, ball firm in his right hand as if magnetically drawn, preparing for one of his patented power dunks. By comparing him with Erving -- Pippen's boyhood idol -- Jackson is painting more than a stately picture. He is saying that Pippen, like Jordan, is a revolutionary talent.&quot;I can tell you the game last year, against the Clippers, when I realized that Scottie had made it to the next level, and I think he only got 8 points,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;He had something like 11 rebounds, 11 assists and was all over the place defensively. He'll probably average something like 18 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists for us this year. If you just go by the numbers, you won't have any idea of his impact on our team.&quot;Scottie Pippen is the youngest of 12 children -- six boys, six girls -- born to Preston and Ethel Pippen. When he was in the ninth grade, his father, a retired factory worker, suffered a stroke and was bedridden or confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, unable to speak. It was a terrible burden for the children, as their father's condition worsened each year. Preston Pippen never attended a game at Central Arkansas, where his son experienced startling growth, on and off the court.&quot;Everyone in my family was pretty tall so we always thought I would get bigger,&quot; Pippen said. He became the tallest Pippen, reaching 6 feet 7 inches by his junior year.By then he was on full basketball scholarship, averaging 18.5 points as a sophomore. Dyer could hardly believe this metamorphosis, and couldn't believe his luck. With his own burgeoning sense of self, Pippen ferociously attacked the weights. When he made out the annual &quot;goal card&quot; that Dyer requested at the start of every season, Pippen wrote: &quot;I would like to be an N.B.A. player.&quot;&quot;It was the first time I'd ever said it,&quot; Pippen said. &quot;Before that, I would've been ashamed.&quot;In his senior year, still playing guard, he averaged 23 points and made almost 60 percent of his shots. He went to the post-season N.B.A. audition camps and sent general managers and scouts scrambling to the telephones. &quot;They didn't know who to call,&quot; said Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton. &quot;No one from the network -- Bobby Knight, Dean Smith -- knew who he was.&quot;Better than the Olympic selection, better than the N.B.A. championship, better even than hisNikecommercial, was the moment he called home after being picked in the draft. His mother told him: &quot;Your daddy watched you on TV. He's got tears running down his face.&quot;It was during a playoff series with Philadelphia in 1990 that Pippen's father died. A short while later, on the day of a seventh game against defending champion Detroit, Pippen suffered his infamous headache, paralyzing him for much of a depressing defeat. The year before, he suffered a concussion after taking an elbow to the head during another losing playoff series against the bruising Pistons.Finally, last spring, came revenge, a four-game sweep of the Pistons, their hated Central Division rival, in the Eastern Conference finals. This time, when Pippen was knocked down by Dennis Rodman, he got up and laughed a champion's last laugh. His line for 17 playoff games averaged out to 21 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists per game.&quot;Scottie's breakthrough was the Detroit series, no question,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;He dominated them. He made them respect him.&quot;In the Bulls' locker room one night before a recent exhibition game, a portrait of Pippen soaring to the basket was presented to him by Rick Lighton, a Michigan artist.&quot;Too much muscle in the arms and legs,&quot; said Chuck Nevitt, the 7-5 journeyman center, standing nearby.&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Pippen said. He pulled off the right sleeve of his warm-up jacket. Striking a pose next to the portrait, he flexed a sculptured muscle.Nevitt looked impressed. The artist, Lighton, smiled at the accuracy of his brush. From 145-pound team manager, Scottie Pippen had become quite a piece of work.",0.0524859457672,0.439366732804,1459 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 23, 1991, Saturday, Late Edition - Final",267 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"he Brandenburg Gate is 200 years old this week and, in celebration, it has been awarded the Iron Cross.The cross in question is firmly grasped by Berlin's ''victory goddess'', who has been restored and placed in her original position, crowning the edifice. The restoration is, however, causing a good deal of angst in a city that has long seen the Brandenburg Gate as a symbol for the militarism of the past and the murder of its own citizens during the division of Berlin.Standing in the ''zentrale Bereich'' - a huge bomb site in the city centre where the new government quarter will eventually be built - the gate has also powerfully symbolised German nationhood. Once cut off from West Berlin by the infamous Wall, the Brandenburg Gate is now in the centre of the reunited city.&nbsp;While it was part of the fabric of the Iron Curtain, it stood for division. ''As long as the Brandenburg Gate remains shut the German question will remain open,'' once wrote President Richard von Weizsacker. The gate was opened again in December 1989 but for some this simply posed a new ''German question''.Resplendent after a 15-month restoration, the gate has found itself at the centre of controversy. Should the gate, topped by the victory goddess's staff with its Prussian eagle and Iron Cross (the medal designed to commemorate the German victory over Napoleon), be allowed to continue a symbol of military might at a time of the greatest, democratic, citizens' revolution since 1945?The goddess herself is a schizophrenic creature. She has had two incarnations - asNike(Berliners refer to her as ''Victoria''), goddess of victory, and as Eireni, goddess of peace.The restoration was planned and would have gone ahead - eventually - in its present form under the old East German regime. It was brought forward because of unification, its impending bicentennial and the damage done by hundreds of New Year's revellers who had wrought considerable damage by clambering on to the gate and, in the process, pruning and pocketing laurel leaves from the goddess's crown.Fierce debate was sparked by the decision to return the sculpture to its pre-Second World War appearance - the last historical phase for which there are records. It was done for reasons of authenticity and because there are no records of the gate's original appearance.The original designers of the gate would have been bemused by the controversy. They certainly did not intend to create a national monument, nor even a triumphal arch. Das Brandenburger Tor was simply one of 18 gates set into the Berlin ramparts. It was particularly fine because it terminated the main avenue, Unter den Linden, leading from the royal palace and was situated on the main route to Brandenburg.The design by Carl G Langhans was inspired by the propylaeum, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. It reflected Prussia's aspirations at the time towards the ideals of Greek culture - peace, order, democracy - rather than military Roman ones with which it has become associated.The quadriga, the four-horsed chariot driven by the goddess, was created by Johann Gottfried Schadow, the foremost Prussian sculptor of the day. Before the image of the Greek goddess of peace, Eireni, was finally chosen, other candidates to be formed in copper included an allegorical figure of Berlin accompanied by a bear (pet symbol of Berlin) and a figure representing the river Spree with a swan.A government decree declared that the gate should be called the Tor des Frieden - ''Gate of Peace'' - and the words were to have been carved on the structure. But, just 15 years after its completion, the structure's significance was totally transformed: after Napoleon's victory at Jena, when he entered Berlin through the Brandenburg Gate, he took the quadriga back to Paris as a trophy - where, apparently, it was stored in boxes in the orangery of the Louvre.When the quadriga came back to Berlin in a triumphant procession in 1815 the Brandenburg Gate was ready to become the symbol of victory: a popular war of liberation against Napoleon had been won and Eireni changed her identity toNike,goddess of victory.Before the quadriga was put back, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the great Prussian Neo-Classical architect responsible for the remodelling of central Berlin (whose work is currently being celebrated in an exhibition at the V &amp; A), replaced the staff that the goddess held. It remained in this form - surmounted by a Prussian eagle, a laurel wreath and an Iron Cross - until the Second World War.The significance of the gate underwent further transformation during the nineteenth century. As Berlin grew and the old ramparts disappeared, the gate was detached from its walls and became a freestanding monument.Prussia finally had its revenge on France in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the square on the gate's eastern side was renamed Pariser Platz, the equivalent of Trafalgar Square. It was under Bismarck that Prussia's symbol became identified with German imperialism.During the Third Reich the gate became a focus of Nazi propaganda, part of the link Hitler sought with Prussian militarism. By 1945, however, the quadriga was totally destroyed and the gate very battered. The city was divided and initially there were no plans for the gate, which was in the East, to be rebuilt.It more than a decade before the quadriga was returned to the reconstructed gate. East Germany had been reluctant to accept a version made in West Berlin from casts taken in 1942; there had even been suggestions that new symbols should be used - a model socialist family watching a rising sun was one idea. In the end, there was only one significant alteration: because of their associations, the Iron Cross and the Prussian eagle were cut out.The latest restoration has restored the omissions made previously for ideological reasons. But what is the identity of the goddess in the united Berlin of 1991? Eirene orNike?To most people such symbolism would be meaningless. Who today ponders the symbolism of the much bigger victory arch at Hyde Park Corner in London? But in Berlin - a city where the meaning of buildings and monuments is being reassessed - it still matters.''Peace'' or ''victory''? No one really knows whether to love or hate the Brandenburg Gate. Perhaps there is a case for giving it back the name it was originally intended to bear: Tor des Frieden - the Gate of Peace.",0.102964312111,0.402486537852,1076 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"May 26, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final",269 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Seven years after he sold Van Kampen Merritt Inc. to Xerox Financial Services, and less than a month after the firm announced it was ceasing its investment banking operations, Bob Van Kampen is ready to plunge back into the municipal bond business.Mr. Van Kampen said yesterday that he is in the process of setting a up new firm with four former Van Kampen Merritt employees. The firm -NikeSecurities -will concentrate initially on trading, underwriting, and the sale of tax-exempt and taxable bonds to institutions and retail investors, he said.His former firm, Lisle, Ill.-based Van Kampen Merritt, abruptly quit the municipal and corporate investment banking business on April 16 to concentrate on the development and distribution of its asset management products, including mutual funds and unit investment trusts, for individuals and institutions.&nbsp;Mr. Van Kampen said discussions with some former longtime Van Kampen Merritt employees led to the decision to start a new firm.&quot;Three weeks ago, the last thing on my mind was to start a new business,&quot; he recalled. &quot;My intention was to help these guys.&quot;Mr. Van Kampen said his loyalty to them was reinforced after he learned that the management at Van Kampen Merritt had called the staff into a hotel room to announce the decision to shut down the investment banking operation, and once they returned, the staff members found their desks locked and security guards posted at the door.The men who had built that company were treated like criminals, he said. &quot;It so bothered me that I said I would do whatever I could do to help.&quot;His partners in the new venture are Ron McAlister and Richard Olson, former vice presidents in institutional sales; Frank Fichera, the former head of national sales; and Scott Hall, a former first vice president of unit investment trust distribution. With the exception of Mr. Hall, the other men were members of the 80-employee investment banking group that Van Kampen Merritt discontinued.Ronald Nyberg, a senior vice president at Van Kampen Merritt, said the security procedures were in place only for 24 hours, to ensure that files were in place to &quot;protect the interests of our customers.&quot;Mr. Van Kampen said he has not been &quot;active&quot; in his former firm for five years. He said he thought it was a joke when he was reached on April 16 with the news that Van Kampen Merritt was discontinuing its investment banking business, effective immediately.However, Mr. Van Kampen pointed out that he had no quarrel with Xerox, saying the decision to drop the investment banking business came from Van Kampen Merritt's management and not the parent company.He also noted thatNikeSecurities would not be competing with Van Kampen Merritt, since it would be concentrating on areas the other firm has discontinued. However, he did leave open the possibility that the new firm could encroach on Van Kampen Merritt's territory in the future.&quot;We have to look at all opportunities,&quot; he stated.Mr. Nyberg concurred with Mr. Van Kampen's observation that the decision to get out of investment banking came from within Van Kampen Merritt. He mentioned that &quot;a number of former&quot; corporate bond traders and salespeople would likely be picked up by Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney Inc., another Xerox subsidiary, and that 10 other investment banking employees were reemployed in other areas of Van Kampen Merritt. He also agreed with Mr. Van Kampen that the new firm would not be viewed as competition, sayingNikeSecurities would be dealing in the capital markets, &quot;a business (Van Kampen Merritt) decided to exit.&quot;While Mr. Van Kampen said his family's trust fund was a major source of investment in the new firm, which will be privately held by the partners, he pointed out that the other partners were also coming up with capital.&quot;The capital, for whatever we want to do, will be there,&quot; he stated.Besides the capital infusion through the trust, Mr. Van Kampen said his role as one of the partners will be to chart the direction of what he said would be a lean operation.&quot;We are not going to try to get there fast, but right,&quot; he pointed out.Mr. Van Kampen traced his loyalty to his new partners back to the late 1970s, when they originally joined Van Kampen Merritt, saying that the firm built its base in the investment banking business with the help of those men. However, under the chairmanship of John C. Merritt, there was a change in the firm's business strategy away from the investment banking side and toward a greater concentration on asset management, Mr. Van Kampen said, adding that &quot;the tail began wagging the dog.&quot;He pointed to the philosophy of life and &quot;spiritual grounding&quot; of his partners in the new venture, saying that the firm would seek &quot;like-minded&quot; people.He said his philosophy placed &quot;a commitment to God&quot; as the highest priority, followed by a commitment to family, and then a commitment to work.&quot;If (a person's) relationship to God is healthy, and (his) marriage is happy, then you have a good employee,&quot; he explained.NikeSecurities, which Mr. McAlister said was named after the Greek word for achiever, is currently operating out of Mr. Van Kampen's West Chicago office in the Chicago suburbs.Despite the ongoing retrenchment and lack of profitability in the industry, Mr. Van Kampen was optimistic about his newest venture.&quot;I said to the guys, 'I'm not coming out of retirement to get beat. I'm coming out to win,' &quot; he said.Mr. Van Kampen began his career in municipal finance with John Nuveen &amp; Co. in 1961. In 1967, he started a bond firm called Van Kampen Wauterlek &amp; Co., which was joined by Clayton Brown six months later, he said. Seven years later, the firm was divided into two separate companies - Van Kampen Merritt and Clayton Brown &amp; Associates. In January 1984, Van Kampen Merritt was sold to Xerox. In 1989, Mr. Van Kampen's family trust became a major investor in Fitch Investors Service Inc.",0.019478365747,0.370842755917,395 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 27, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final",271 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Just like people, more companies are using physical fitness to stay in good shape.The growing trend toward the sponsorship of fitness-related events points to a healthy desire by Canadian companies to raise their profiles among conscious consumers.''The growth in sponsorship reflects a trend through the 1980s, when the public was becoming more aware of fitness,'' says Graham Fraser, owner of TriSport Promotions Inc. of Grimsby, Ont., a promoter of triathlon events across the country. ''Ten years ago, most of our sponsors wouldn't have talked to us. Now they like to sell the fact they're associated with a fitness-related event.''&nbsp;In some cases, boosting exposure through spectator or participant sports is a natural.Athletic-wear companies, such asNikeInc., have developed multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns featuring professional athletes like football and baseball star Bo Jackson and basketball player Michael Jordan to win over aspiring athletes across the continent.Regionally, smaller promotional events, such as community coaching clinics and local sporting events, bring the corporate message closer to consumers.''The big, international sponsorships are well known, but we try to bring to make the brand more personal by sponsoring local events, too,'' says Roy Agostino, promotions co-ordinator forNikeCanada Ltd.'s Eastern region.''This is the bread-and-butter of our business,'' says Murray Souter, vice-president of marketing at Toronto-based Reebok Canada, a division of Avrecan International Inc. ''It's much like automakers sponsoring pro car racing - we need to be involved.''For such companies, athletic sponsorships take on a practical quality. By providing top-flight athletes with their product, the shoe companies get wear-testing data and free expert design input in return.But for others, the connection isn't so apparent.In 1990, for example, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. spent more than $500,000 on sponsorship of a nationwide triathlon series in conjunction with Reebok, Toshiba and other sponsors, and plans to continue its association with the sport for another three years.COMMON THEMEMoncton-based Cavendish Farms sponsors a junior ski-racing program at selected resorts across the country; McKenzie Financial Corp. in Toronto does the same at Ontario resorts.And Crown Life Insurance Co. sponsors the Participaction Challenge, in which more than four million Canadians register 15 minutes of physical activity on a specified date each year.Emphasizing their commitment to local communities is a common theme among corporate sponsors.''As an insurance company, we like people to be well,'' says Barry Francis, assistant vice-president of corporate communications at Crown Life, which spends about $500,000 on the event annually. ''But it's also a great way to enhance the image of the company. Our representatives get a higher profile in the communities where they live and work.''While the public-relations aspect of promoting a healthy clientele can'tbe underestimated, few sponsors would deny that they're cashing in on the high-profile nature of sports. In most cases, decision-makers look for well-advertised events with high attendance figures to get the most bang for their buck.NOTHING IN STONEAnd when considering a fitness-related sponsorship, few firms will take the initiative and organize an event on their own. In most cases, the sport's national association, or a promotional company like TriSport, takes care of the organization, advertising, and promotion, while the company provides the funding.Though companies will often maintain an association with a particular event for several years, the value of their commitment is rarely written in stone, Fraser says. Given the current recession, therefore, some athletic events may see the level of sponsorship drop considerably over the next year.''One of the first things to go when times get tough is usually discretionary spending, and sponsorship often fits into that category,'' Fraser points out. ''Some companies may find it hard to justify spending a lot of money on sponsorship, but they'll still want the exposure. It'll be a tough time for anyone just getting into the game.''",0.141564854898,0.355831443689,718 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 4, 1991",272 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian retailers may be putting on a brave face but therecession-weary industry is bracing itself for yet another threat.Spurred on by attractive real estate deals and the need to expand beyond local markets, more and more international retailers are planning to open stores in Canada.At a recent seminar hosted by The Fashion Group International, a capacity crowd heard presentations from the four latest entrants: Talbots, Tiffany &amp; Co., Harrods and Cole-Haan.They join invaders such as The Gap, Ikea, Price Club and HMV that have succeeded with clearly defined concepts targeting specific niches.&nbsp;But industry studies, including a recent report by Deloitte &amp; Touche, indicate Canadian retailers do not see this trend as a threat and, in fact, are welcoming the competition.Shirley Dawe, president of retail consultants Shirley Dawe Associates in Toronto, says Canadian retailers are ''putting their heads in the sand'' if they believe international competition will not affect their operations.''They've got stronger retail concepts and there's no misunderstanding about what the operations stand for,'' she says.She thinks this will force Canadian retailers to ''get into the real world,'' spruce up their concepts and stress the importance of service.Women's wear retailer Talbots plans to open three stores in Toronto in September, including a downtown outlet located on upscale Bloor St. West.The Hingham, Mass.-based company has a five-year international expansion plan, which began last year with a store in Toyko.Paul Kastner, vice-president, new business, says Talbots hopes to have 15 to 20 stores in Canada by 1995.''Canada is an important part of our international expansion plans,'' he says. ''Our research indicated the need in Toronto for classic apparel at reasonable price points.''Yarmouth, Me.-based Cole-Haan, an upscale shoe retailer owned byNikeInc., is opening its first Canadian outlet, also on Bloor St. W., after studying the market for five years.This is the third international market the Yarmouth, Me.-based company has entered - it follows forays into Japan, where it operates three stores, and Italy.Cathy Taylor, vice-president, retail, says the chain was reluctant to open a store in Canada unless an ideal location became available.''I won't take on a location unless it's 100%,'' she says. ''I want an expression for Cole-Haan in a grand way. We're not a boutique but a large specialty house in it for the long run.''Tiffany, the internationally renowned jewelry retailer, will open a 13,000 square-foot store in Toronto in November while Harrods International operates a small outlet in Terminal Three of Toronto's Pearson International Airport.Despite the free trade agreement, U.S. retailers find entering the Canadian market difficult.Jane Baldwin, president of The Matrix Group in Toronto, said the surprises of doing business in Canada include higher taxes, real estate and labor costs that make retail prices 15% to 30% higher than in the U.S.''The major companies are very sophisticated but when you first start talking to them they haven't considered Canada to be that complex,'' she says. ''In order to execute plans they need some local help to make it happen.''Matrix, which specializes in retail locations, has been approached recently by more U.S. retailers, Baldwin said, because they are a lot more optimistic and see Canada as a key part of international expansion.She helped Talbots come to Canada and is now working with another ''major'' U.S. retailer interested in setting up shop in Vancouver.Howard Schultz, president and CEO of Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co., which has 15 outlets in Vancouver, says it's important to recognize the cultural differences between the two countries.''We spent a great deal of time in planning and, as a result, we were very prepared to understand the differences in perception of the product,'' he says. ''We were highly sensitive to aligning ourselves to Canadian vendors and becoming deeply rooted in the community.''Other international retailers, such as Japanese department stores Sogo Co. Ltd. and Yaohan, are rumored to be looking at sites in downtown Vancouver.And while there has been much speculation about Seattle-based Nordstrom coming to Vancouver, Peter Hume, a senior consultant with Thomas Consultants in Vancouver, expects Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chain to move into Vancouver or Southern Ontario first.",0.171265449526,0.397098312316,761 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"August 7, 1991, Wednesday",273 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"TODAY'S Tweed Valley triathlon will have some of the big names from the Gold Coast missing, but organisers of the event say they are not too concerned.Many top Gold Coast triathletes have chosen to compete at Taree or in the second race of theNikeseries in Sydney.&nbsp;One of the Tweed Valley race organisers, John Hanley, said they had close to 300 nominations, with the race growing in popularity for the past three years.&quot;The whole event is aimed at the average triathlete and not for the big names who chase the big purses,&quot; Hanley said.&quot;The Tweed Valey triathlon carries $2,000 in prize money, with $300 going to the open male winner,&quot; he said.Triathletes start and finish at the Murwillumbah Rowing Club after swimming 1,500m in the Tweed River, cycling 40km past Chillingham, and then running 10km through the sugar cane fields.&quot;Both the cycle and run legs take the triathletes through the main street, so spectators are well looked after,&quot; Hanley said.Last year's winner, Miles Stewart, has not been nominated.His father and manager, Col Stewart, said Miles - who won the first race of theNikeseries on the Gold Coast last weekend - would either compete at Taree or in Sydney.Tweed Heads-based triathlete Mike Doyle, who won the Tweed race in 1989, will be looking to break his course record of 1:55.11.His training partner, Glenn Forbes, from Benora Point, is another definite starter.Forbes is preparing for the national long-course championships in South Australia next February, followed by the Canberra Sri Chimori Triathlon a week later.The triathlon has six divisions, with the over-45s and women's sections strongly supported.

"&quot;If they can't be safe at school, where can they be safe?&quot;A distressed Mr Emanuel Alexis was speaking after a playground brawl which left one of his sons, George, 19, in hospital with a broken jaw and fractured skull.&nbsp;His other son Con, 17, has a cut face and a black eye.The brawl erupted at Glebe High School about 11 am yesterday after six gang youths came into the playground and allegedly threw a metal garbage bin at a Year 12 student.George and Con went to help the student, and the scuffle escalated to a brawl within seconds.One Year 10 student, who did not want to be named, said he had seen George fall to the ground convulsing after he was kicked in the head by one of the gang members.&quot;His head hit the pavement and I just heard this crack. I went over to him and pulled his tongue from the back of his mouth because he wasn't breathing at all.&quot;The whole thing happened so quickly it's hard to say what really caused it... we just thought the gang was trying to roll them for theirNikeAirs.&quot;Two teachers and a clerical assistant tried to break up the fight and detain the gang members until the police arrived.An ambulance spokesman said nine people had been taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the Children's Hospital, Camperdown, including the two teachers and clerical assistant. Several others were treated at the scene.A Year 10 student, Brad Leung, also saw the fight. He said the gang members were wearing black and blue bandanas favoured by a local gang called the City Crew Cribs.Brad, 17, said that Glebe High students were involved in rumbles with local standover gangs &quot;at least once a week&quot;.&quot;Usually all they want are your Reeboks orNikes,&quot; he said.However, according to the principal of Glebe High, Mr Pat Kidd, the attack was an isolated incident which had been &quot;blown out of proportion&quot;.Mr Tim Mack, the father of an injured Year 12 student, agreed. &quot;There are rough heads wherever you go ... it's just a fact of life,&quot; he said. &quot;These kids are nearly 18: you can't keep them at home until they are 50 to protect them.&quot;The Minister for School Education, Mrs Chadwick, yesterday commended the school staff for their &quot;courage&quot; in acting swiftly to protect students.The brawl will be the subject of a full Department of Education investigation.By late last night, one person, a 19-year-old, had been charged with assault. Another two youths were being detained for questioning and police were still scouring the area for three other suspects.The charged youth was released on bail to appear in Balmain Local Court on March 26.The brawl is at least the third serious violent incident in Sydney schools in the past 13 months. In February last year, eight teenagers were injured in a battle between 60 students from Blacktown Boys' High and Patrician Brothers School.

"THE two-match series against Czechoslovakia is going to be a huge test for the Socceroo side being assembled by new national coach Eddie Thomson.That warning came from Socceroo veteran Paul Wade as the countdown starts to the first internationals of the year.Wade made his international debut against the Czechoslovakians in 1986 and has no doubts they will mean business when they arrive. &quot;In '86, they turned up in the morning and were still good value in a 1-1 draw when they played us the same day after the long flight from Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;They tore us apart in the later games, thrashing us 3-0 in the game in Sydney.&nbsp;&quot;They were so fit and so good on the ball, they didn't give you time to close down. If we let them get control, they might not let us get a touch of the ball for 90 minutes.&quot;I don't say that to scare anyone - I just think it is the preparation we need for finding the squad which can cope with international competition.&quot;While the internationals are something to look forward to, Wade is still basking in the glory of scoring one of the best goals of the season to give South Melbourne a 1-0 win over Melita Eagles last weekend.The midfielder ran on to a lay-off from Paul Wade to hit a scorcher on the volley into the top corner.&quot;My calling for the ball has become known as the 'Wadey scream' around the club and I made one of them as I ran forward while Paul had two or three players bearing down on him,&quot; Wade said.&quot;I didn't have time to control as the lay-off came and it could have ended in the Middle Park lake but I hit it sweetly.&quot; The effort and Wade's midfield performance has earned him the player of the week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.&quot;Some of our supporters weren't too happy with our performance but we came up against a good side in Melita,&quot; Wade said.&quot;They made us look ordinary in the first half but I felt we turned up the heat as the game wore on. We deserved both points.&quot; Wade feels his good performance was helped by his move to central midfield - and is hoping to hang on to the position at least for another week.&quot;Mike Petersen, Steve Tasios and myself all prefer the central midfield spot because of the added freedom.&quot;Petersen and Tasios were missing through illness last week but are expected to be back jostling for the spot for this weekend's trip to Adelaide City.Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.

"THE lure of European soccer is among the main reasons behind Ivan Kelic's rise among the top scorers of the National Soccer League.Kelic is the third highest scorer, with 10 goals in 15 games, and providing he keeps up the average, he should at least double his NSL career tally of 16.He is one of the tall strikers in the league and, with partner Frances Awaritefe, used his aerial skill to break down Sunshine's rearguard at the weekend.&nbsp;His efforts have earned him the player-of-the-week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award.As the winner he receives a pair ofNikeAir runners retailing at $280.Kelic harbors the desire to finish the season at the top of the scorers list to give him added ammunition for his ulterior aim.&quot;I'd love to do it (be top scorer), but the main aim is to help Melbourne Croatia finish in the top three and then have a serious go at winning the league in the championship play-offs,&quot; he said yesterday.His confidence comes from a trip with the combined Melbourne-Sydney Croatia team to Europe to play five games against the likes of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb in the NSL close season.&quot;I was virtually scoring in every game and once I was able to do so against overseas players, I knew I had the capability to approach the NSL confidently,&quot; he said.The unexpected reward from the trip was an invitation from Hajduk to spend time with the club pre-season this coming July-August.&quot;Vedran Rozic, the former coach of Sydney Croatia, is now the vice-president at Hajduk and he had a chat with me and invited me to give him a call at the end of our season,&quot; Kelic said.Kelic believes this is Melbourne Croatia's best ever chance of winning the title.&quot;If we don't win it now, I don't know if and when the club will come close to it again,&quot; he said.END OF STORY",0.199768518519,0.435300925926,308 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,Nike - European Apparel - GmbH,279 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"A GREATER control over his playing career and a change of direction in future plans have brought about Craig Foster's imminent transfer to Singapore.The midfielder yesterday received the signed contract and the flight tickets to go to Singapore on April 2, only a day after he completes his NSL commitments with Sunshine George Cross.Foster is buying his own contract from Sunshine for $15,000 to have a higher degree of control on his playing future.&nbsp;&quot;I've signed to play for Singapore between May and October but if the team qualifies for the finals it could extend to December,&quot; Foster said.&quot;And I don't want to get into the same trouble that Alistair Edwards and Abbas Saad got into, with Sydney Olympic putting the pressure on them to return prematurely.&quot; Foster is one of the three imports allowed to play for Singapore's national side, which competes in the Malaysian national league.He first made contact with the team while flying back from a stint in Germany and the Singapore FA has been chasing his signature for the past three months.Before his Singapore mission, there is the job in hand, and that is to get as many points for bottom side Sunshine in the remaining five weeks of the season.The rescue mission does not look as impossible after the 5-0 away win against Sydney Croatia last Sunday.Foster was regarded as the lynch-pin of the victory and has earned the player of the week title in the Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot award as a result.Herald-SunNikeAir Golden Boot Award.

"FORGET the tennis - one of the most constantly asked questions as the countdown to Wimbledon hits top gear is &quot;just what will Andre Agassi be wearing?&quot; Not since Gussie Moran outraged the establishment with her lace pants in 1949 has fashion been so prominent in pre-Wimbledon discussions.While Agassi licks his wounds over losing last week's French Open final to fellow American Jim Courier, it seems almost everyone else is licking their lips in anticipation of what the luminous lad from Las Vegas will turn out in when he makes his much-anticipated Wimbledon return in 11 days time.&nbsp;So just what will Agassi, or rather his sponsors,Nike, come up with for the All England Championships, which start on Monday week? The man himself is not saying.&quot;You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,&quot; Agassi said when asked in Paris.The word, according to one media hound, is that the Las Vegas showman will turn out for his first match in classical white from his headband down to his cycling shorts.After that, he said, Agassi was likely to introduce a lightly colored outfit.Reports this week saidNike, after discussing designs with Agassi, had been putting alternatives to the All England Committee and referee Alan Mills for approval.Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, admits that officials do not think it right to stipulate any percentage of white.&quot;A very small amount of psychedelic coloring can be off-putting, while a pastel-colored shirt could be perfectly acceptable,&quot; he said.&quot;We feel - and I think the players feel too - that this is one of our better traditions.&quot; - AAPEND OF STORY",0.112150415722,0.470377928949,281 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,Nike Aktiebolaget,281 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Record falls to Matthews in all-the-way triathlon win MARK MATTHEWS continued his winning run in the first race of the Blackstone HeightsNikeTriathlon Series in Launceston yesterday.Louise Fairfax broke through for her first win in the women's section.Matthews led the 79 starters from the start and completed the 500m swim, 5km run and 18km cycle sections in 51m31s - a race record.&nbsp;Devonport's Scott Russell was second, 2m11s behind Matthews. He was followed by Devonport's Glen Fairbrother (55.09), Launceston's Grant Titmus (56.06) and coastal athletes Darren Turner (56.12) and Doug Watts (56.13).Fairfax was 10th after the swim and run but faded in the cycle to finish in 1.03.39 in 25th place overall.She finished well in front of second placegetter Margaret Taplin (1.08.36). Then came Megan MacPherson (1.09.25), Bernadette Matthews (1.13.35), Michelle Carrington-Smith (1.14.02) and Ellen Whinnett (1.16.03).State champion Matthews was first out of the water, swimming the 500m in 7m49s, which included the swim-run transition.He was followed by junior Jason Hawke (7.52), Malcolm Wells (8.04) and northern tennis star Andrew Youl (8.16).Matthews then took off in the run to open a commanding 1m24s lead over Scott Russell, who had moved from seventh after the swim to second.He was followed into the run-bike transition by Malcolm Wells, a further minute back. He led a pack of seven athletes, including Fairfax, who had moved from 23rd after the swim into 10th with one of the fastest run splits of the day.On the bike, Matthews extended his lead by 48 seconds over Russell to win the first race in the $5000 three-race series.Both Fairfax and Matthews won a pair ofNikeAir Pegasus running shoes worth $160 and $70 cash.The first veteran (40 and over) was Jeff James (57.47), who was ninth overall.There was a three-way battle in the junior section.

"Dashing Andre Agassi, the heart-throb of world-class tennis,is a hit at Wimbledon - especially with the women who adorehis rebellious, way-out style and flowing locks.But the real man behind the wild images - in fashion and behavior- and who amazed fans by adhering to club rules, turning outin virginal all-white on Centre Court this weekend - has revealedhow drink and drugs threatened to claim his explosive talentbefore he discovered religion.Agassi, three times a finalist in his past three Grand Slamtournaments, who went on to win his rain-interrupted lead-upmatch, sat with girlfriend Wendy Stewart at his side and said:&quot;I have experienced drugs and excessive drinking.&quot;&nbsp;What did he drink? &quot;Everything,&quot; he says. &quot;At times, I coulddrink without stopping.&quot;At 13, he was enrolled at Nick Bollettieri's famous TennisAcademy in Florida - a world away from his Las Vegas roots.Agassi confesses: &quot;I used to rebel against everything. I grewmy hair long because school said you couldn't have it that way.Drank winewith the guys&quot;I got to drinking wine when I hung out with the other academyguys. I enjoyed it just because you weren't supposed to.

Runaway winner of theNikesprint series this year despite missing the first leg of the four-race series.Brad Beven (Qld). Runner-up to Welch in Orlando and an outstanding swimmer. With be right up with the lead going into the bike leg and should be hard to run down.Stephen Foster (Vic). The third leg of Australia's 1-2-3 finish in Orlando, but most likely to suffer from the heat during the killer bike leg.Miles Stewart (Qld). Has a big advantage through his local knowledge and training on the course. Won the first leg of theNikeseries in Welch's absence and the man most likely to challenge the top three seeds.Nick Croft (Qld). Experienced competitor who will captain the Queensland team in this event. Top swimmer who will battle with Beven to be first out of the water going into the bike leg.Women: Liz Hepple (Qld). Olympic cyclist who finished third in the 1988 women's Tour de France. A dominant force since switching to triathlons and named the 1990 Triathlete of the Year.Bianca van Woesick (Qld).

"&nbsp;Saturday. The sun punches through slightly drawn curtains, birds are chirping on the patio, jazz piano plays on the stereo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Fred Dyles' day to himself, a release from high school basketball, from coaching Gibbs, the marquee team in Pinellas County&nbsp;with 29 wins and just two losses, with three senior stars headed for Division I universities, a favorite in its division of the state tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the way I relax,&quot; said Dyles, whose leisure clothes include a blue sweatshirt with &quot;Gladiator basketball&quot; on the left chest and theNikecoaching shoes he wears at practices. &quot;Of course, I go fishing quite a bit. And there are other things too.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the phone rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Teal, Gibbs' point guard and one of those three seniors, is several hours from boarding a plane for his official visit to the University of Arkansas, and he is calling Dyles for last-minute advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles talks like a concerned father: &quot;Are you going to wear that new track suit? You better dress warm because it's cooler up there.&nbsp; Do you have enough money?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no getting away from the game. He has done these same things at the same school for 27 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles relationship with his players is more than just basketball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972 when Dan Wright's mother died, Dyles drove him to Valdosta, Ga. For the two weeks after her death, Wright stayed with Dyles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm their father, their brother and their best friend,&quot; said Dyles, married for 10 years and stepfather to two children. &quot;If they have a problem or need some help or something, I want to know about it. I guess I was put on this earth to work with children.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little more to it than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has won 544 games (third among active coaches in Florida) and three state championships and coached numerous college prospects. (Along with Teal this year, the other Division I prospects are Dwight Brown and Pat Lawrence.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles' career began during the civil rights movement and the subsequent integration of state schools, and Gibbs was St.  Petersburg's predominant black high school team. In 1966, his team won the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association (FIAA) crown for all-black schools; in 1967, Gibbs won the Florida High School Activities Association (FHSAA) championship in the school's first season of integrated athletics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Winning back-to-back titles, it was real special,&quot; said Elbert Crumb, a player on those teams and now the head basketball coach at Osceola. &quot;It was black versus white, but that talk never entered the locker room. Coach (Dyles) didn't allow that.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His approach was that you had to be twice as good,&quot; said Wright, a 1972 Gibbs alumnus and now the Lakewood coach, &quot;the same as it is in the real world.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles graduated from Gibbs in 1951. Although a military obligation (from 1954 to 1957) split his collegiate career at Florida A&amp;M, Dyles returned and was an All-American during his junior and senior years. After graduation, Dyles began teaching at 16th Street Junior High in St. Petersburg and was also an assistant basketball coach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 16th Street coach Sidney Campbell got sick at midseason, Dyles became the interim coach. &quot;When Sidney got well, he came to me and said that he was a football coach and that he'd recommend me for the job,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;I've been rolling ever since.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three years, 16th Street's basketball team was undefeated (96-0) and won three junior high school state championships. And when his ninth-graders at 16th Street graduated to Gibbs in 1964, Dyles returned to his alma mater with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of segregation, Gibbs was St. Petersburg's only all-black high school and its athletic teams competed in the FIAA. During his first two seasons, Gibbs made the FIAA's semifinals and won the 1966 state title.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You just couldn't imagine how much talent was there,&quot; said Dyles, referring to the competition in the FIAA. &quot;Because you could only keep 15 players, there was some good talent left off our team. I welcomed integration (court-ordered for Pinellas County in 1972) because it allowed more players an opportunity to play.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By fall 1966, Gibbs became the first all-black school integrated into the FHSAA. Later that year, the two associations (FIAA and FSHAA) merged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles remembers FHSAA executive secretary Floyd Lay warning him and former Gibbs principal Emmanuel Stewart of racial prejudices his team might experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lay told me what people would say,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;Sure, some people said some things, but I had my troops ready. In fact, I think that we were treated better then than we are now. That's because they (FHSAA officials) wanted it (integration) to work so bad.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But long before the FHSAA integrated, Dyles did. He and former Dixie Hollins coach Roy King conducted secret Saturday practices.  At the time, Dixie Hollins was an all-white school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'd hide our cars, lock up in his gym and scrimmage like hell for a couple of hours,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;We just got tired of scrimmaging against our own people. He wanted to be ready for the Clearwaters and the Dunedins.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dyles has seen the changes in basketball the athleticism of the players, the equipment and the three-point shot but that hasn't altered his teams' style of play or the message for his players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I try to teach a guy not to quit,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;If his family needs food, I don't want him to go hide with his tail between his legs. I want him to be able to go out and get his family some food.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that responsibility, Dyles' system also provides for freedom of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've always been an advocate of what they call the run-and-gun or street ball. I played that way in high school,&quot; said Dyles, who was coached by Joe Johnson. &quot;I always said he (Johnson) was 30 years ahead of his time. But as soon as my white counterparts started doing this, they called it a transition game.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyles' program has been blessed with athletes, but he said his goal is to make them total players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've always stressed conditioning, then have taught players dribbling skills and low-post players the dropstep,&quot; Dyles said. &quot;For example, Bill Teal might make a pass to Pat between his legs, but that's fundamentals. He knows where his teammates are, it's just that his pass has a little extra on it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his success, Dyles has never been asked or invited to coach a state all-star game. But that hasn't hurt his credibility with his peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think that you see lots of coaches come and go,&quot; said FHSAA state basketball chairman and Port St. Lucie coach Ed Kershner, &quot;but he's stood the test of time. Staying with the game, changing with the players and being a coaches' coach is a tribute to the man.  With all the talent that he's coached, he's brought recognition to the state of Florida.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pinellas County, Dyles' coaching influence lives. He coached both of the county's other two black boys basketball coaches Osceola's Crumb and Lakewood's Wright.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a game, Dyles is wide-eyed, leaning toward the court from his seat on the bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a whistle blows stopping play, Dyles waits for the official's call. If he disagrees with it, he'll let it be known.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His motto to his players best describes his personality: &quot;Fight the battles on the court and I'll take care of everything else.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dyles' outspoken nature has been costly. During the past three seasons, he has been fined three times by the FHSAA for criticizing officiating in the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Gibbs, Dyles' actions aren't questioned but appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a game, Dyles draws a bigger crowd than his three stars, Teal, Brown or Lawrence. No matter the outcome, admirers offer congratulatory handshakes and pats on the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past several seasons, Dyles has coached amid speculation that he would retire. Since he loses three starters after the season, the talk has intensified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dyles is quick to deny such comments. &quot;Are you kidding? I'm in good health and I'm still impacting lives,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the playoffs approach, Gibbs focuses on a possible third consecutive trip to the Class 3A final four.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption is that because Gibbs hasn't won a title in its two previous trips, the team has been disappointing. But Dyles offers his perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, getting there is an accomplishment,&quot; he said. &quot;That's something no one can take away from this group and they deserve to be there. I really want this group to win one (state championship).&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pause and then: &quot;I bet you if this group gets there, they'll win it.&quot;FRED DYLES' ALL-TIME GIBBS TEAMPlayer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pos.&nbsp;Ht.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CollegeNorm Stevenson&nbsp;G&nbsp;6-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1969&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oklahoma StateComments: Parade All-American.

"&nbsp;Tusie Menne, a 58-year-old Tampa homemaker, walks five miles a day, rides an exercise bike and works out at a health club.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she is not answeringNike'scalls to &quot;Just do it.&quot; Nor has she heeded Cher's sassy health club plugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those commercials are aimed at people much younger than she.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't pay a lot of attention to them,&quot; Menne said. &quot;In fact, I don't watch much TV.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Menne does notice the Total breakfast cereal commercials.  She said she believes the ads that claim Total is nutritionally superior to other brands, partly because those ads feature people who seem to be her contemporaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total is her favorite cereal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature consumers like Menne are becoming an important group to reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, most marketing companies have been slow about targeting the 50-plus age group. They pursued nearly everyone else teen-agers, dual-income couples, working women and young urban professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next decade, more baby-boomers will graduate into their 50s and marketers will need to cater to these more experienced consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is happening is there will be a great demographic shift,&quot; said Toni J. Pallatto, owner of Gift of Gold, an Ohio-based&nbsp; consumer marketing company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During the 1990s, the number of people 50 and older will increase 76.7 percent. Correspondingly, people in the 18 to 39 cohort whom marketing people typically target that group shrinks by 10 percent.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have much to learn about how to talk to this more active and experienced generation, said marketing experts specializing in older consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot of people over 50 are talking about living into their 90s&quot; said Judith Langer, a consumer marketing consultant in New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They are in better health than previous generations; they exercise, watch their nutrition. They are taking more vacations and spending a lot of money. If you still view them as a bunch of old poops, you're going to miss out on an important market.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-50 group already controls 70 percent of the nation's financial assets and 50 percent of its discretionary income representing a total of $ 130-billion in buying power, according to the National Underwriter-Life &amp; Health, a statistical magazine for the insurance industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Florida provides a crucial testing ground for companies researching ways to appeal to mature consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten of its cities have the oldest populations in the country and the state is home to 6.9 percent of the nation's 64.6-million older adults, according to Sales and Marketing Management, a New York demographics service. In the Tampa Bay area alone, at least six market research companies specialize in polling senior consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift of Gold, an Ohio consumer survey firm, this month is shipping free samples and special offers from national consumer companies to 6,000 senior residents in the Tampa Bay area. The residents have agreed to evaluate brands such as Cheerios cereal, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Pan Am airlines, Hamburger Helper and Guest Quarters Suite Hotels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weitzman &amp; Philip Inc., a Miami market research firm, performs about a quarter of its 400 consumer surveys each year on Florida's senior citizens, said Daniel H. Philip, president. Some of the studies have investigated what kinds of tire treads appeal to senior citizens, what lawn mowers are easiest to use, what liquor they drink, and whether they do their own home maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The senior citizen complexes here are bombarded with Clairol and Mary Kay samples,&quot; Philip said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the research tools available to them, some consumer goods companies still manage to offend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern Maturity, the American Association of Retired Persons' monthly magazine, rejects about 40 percent of advertisements proposed to it because the ads portray the 50-plus reader as weak, doddering or ill. Some of the rejected ads sell hemorrhoid treatments, wheelchairs and tub lifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We feel they drag the book down and depress our readers,&quot; said Leda Sanford, ad director of the 34-million circulation magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Modern Maturity has rejected ads for most incontinence products because they picture the product and feature clinical diagrams that refer to leakage, bladder control and other personal issues. But recently the magazine accepted a Serenity ad by Johnson &amp; Johnson because it showed a woman enjoying life and it suggested that readers see a doctor about the problem, Sanford said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AARP, a national advocacy group, also opposes advertisements that feature scare tactics, such as some commercials for insurance products and medical alert services, Sanford said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you talk to senior citizens in a way that doesn't insult them?&quot; Philip asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Once you get beyond the products that are natural for senior citizens, marketing companies haven't gotten their act together as far as senior citizens' particular habits. They figure they're trying to sell upbeat, cutting-edge products that are hard to market to senior citizens. But they haven't done senior citizen marketing research.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some product managers are just too young to know, Pallatto said. Many brand managers are in their 20s and 30s. Recently she met one who believed senior citizens rarely use deodorant and skin cream and rarely wash their hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some beauty companies think along the same lines, said Sanford of Modern Maturity. Few cosmetics and skin care companies advertise in Modern Maturity, even though some of their products supposedly counteract dry skin and wrinkles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They (beauty companies) have a complex about age,&quot; Sanford said. &quot;They have been worshiping at the altar of youth for so long, they have had a hard time coping with the fact that everybody is getting older.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estee Lauder is one of the few cosmetics and fragrance lines that has a franchise among older women, Sanford and Langer said. The name of its new fragrance, Knowing, subtly signifies that experience and maturity can be sexy and feminine, Langer added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an Estee Lauder Inc. spokeswoman, Marguerite Barney, said the company doesn't market to specific age groups and hadn't targeted Knowing to older women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties in reaching older consumers is in pinpointing their diverse lifestyles and values, Pallatto said. Two women may have the same goals when they're 20 to get married, to have a career or to have a family but chances are by the time they are 40 they have taken distinctly different paths, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is a lot easier marketing to somebody who is 18,&quot; she said.  &quot;Chances are (marketers) have gotten a handle on who they are. We can sell them a pair of jeans. The question is how do you sell jeans to someone 50 and older?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many clothing companies don't know, said William D. Haueisen, president of Sterling Research Group Inc., a St. Petersburg-based retail marketing company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older women, like most men, usually feel less of a need to bow to the whims of fashion. Consequently many clothiers may face leaner years ahead, he predicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical styles that last longer but don't look &quot;old&quot; will be at a premium, he said. Women's business attire will be less in demand, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menne estimated that it has been at least six months since she added to her wardrobe. &quot;I've got better things in my closet from 20 years ago than what they've got in stores today,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food marketers are better at targeting to older consumers. In the past decade, hundreds of foods have been reformulated with lower salt and cholesterol or with more fiber, partly a reflection of food companies' realization that consumers are getting older but want to feel younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell Soup Co.'s V8 juice and Le Menu Healthy dinners are specifically being positioned for the 50-plus consumer. Kellogg Co.  changed its Bran Flakes to 40-Plus Bran Flakes to appeal to older consumers after surveys revealed more than 60 percent of bran eaters are at least 45 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all efforts succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerber Products Co. in the mid-1970s test-marketed a line of pureed foods for adults called Singles. The meals were in glass jars&nbsp; that bore the Gerber label.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They failed because of the onset of microwave foods, said James Lovejoy, a Gerber spokesman. Haueisen disagreed, saying that older people perceived Singles as baby food for adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of today's seniors reject their rocking-chair image, Langer, the marketing consultant, said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 50-plus consumer panel she set up to test senior citizens' attitudes was particularly annoyed by Denny's restaurant ad campaigns, featuring a forgetful woman who calls the chain &quot;Lenny's.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That ad particularly showed an old lady doddering,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Things are going to change dramatically in the next decade, not because people are becoming more moral or more caring, but because they want to make money,&quot; Sanford of Modern Maturity said.Times researchers Debbie Wolfe and Kitty Bennett contributed to this report.Age in AmericaHere are the 10 oldest and youngest areas in the United States, by median age, according to Sales &amp; Marketing Management.The 10 OldestSarasota&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52.1 Bradenton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45.7Fort Myers-Cape Coral&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43.1Daytona Beach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42.2W.

"&nbsp;Pamela Salvo Miller drives up and down Bruce B. Downs Boulevard almost every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only after her brother was shot and killed last week did she learn that he had been living in a home made of plastic sheets in the woods just off the street.&nbsp;v v &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Homeless&quot; that's what the Sheriff's Office and the media have called her brother, a word that seems hard for her to come to terms with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said, &quot;My little brother went back to the campsite (Saturday), and a new little family's already moved in. That's how many of them are out there.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Vincent Salvo, 34, was shot and killed Thursday evening.  Shortly after midnight, agents with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement stopped two men on suspicion of drunken driving near Ocala. When the agents ran the two men's names through a computer, they learned that both were wanted in Salvo's slaying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth Arthur, 41, and James Joseph Mahoney, 50, both of Tampa, were charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. They were being held Sunday night at the Hillsborough County Jail without bail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives say Salvo was killed during a fight at his campsite near the Sunpointe Lake Apartments, 14200 Bruce B. Downs Blvd.  Investigators think the fight stemmed from a quarrel between Arthur and his girlfriend, who had moved in with Salvo on Wednesday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheriff's deputies say it is not clear who fired the gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives did not release the woman's name, but Miller identified her as Brenda Blackburn, a woman her brother had been dating on and off for about eight years. Blackburn also dated Arthur, Miller said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackburn could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said the last time she saw her brother was about a month ago. She said he was on his way to New Port Richey with Blackburn to work at a construction site. He hoped to make enough money to travel to California and join a carnival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Miller learned instead that her brother's plastic tent, outfitted with dishes, utensils and canned food, had been his home for about eight months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They're putting him in the category of the homeless, but this thing was set up like an apartment,&quot; she said. &quot;He had two beds that were made he was always real nice and neat and next to them were hisNikeand Reebok tennis shoes.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said her brother, an alcoholic, apparently chose this lifestyle. She does not consider him someone who was forced to live in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My parents would have helped him out anytime,&quot; she said. &quot;You see, he had that option.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salvos moved to Lutz in 1963. Phillip Salvo went to Lutz Elementary School and Buchanan Junior High School. He was in Little League and Boy Scouts and became avidly interested in electronics, his sister said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was the kind of guy who was always offering to rake the neighbors' leaves,&quot; Miller said. &quot;One Christmas, he got a motorcycle. He was always tearing it apart and putting it back together.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said her brother had some &quot;teen-age problems&quot; and was caught several times burglarizing homes. But then he got married and settled down, living in a home in Lutz that had a swimming pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, he and his wife had a son, but the infant lived only seven days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And that's what sent him off the deep end,&quot; Miller said. &quot;He started going out and coming home drunk. Within months, he was divorced.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived with different friends and worked on and off at an Exxon station in north Tampa. For a time, he worked for Miller at a pub she owned in Lutz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He floated in and out. If he needed something, he'd come by,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his baby died, Miller said, her brother seemed to lose the will to lead the &quot;standard&quot; life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those material things weren't important to him,&quot; she said. &quot;As long as he ate decent and had whatever little things he needed.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller said she and her father found a letter to Brenda Blackburn in her brother's belongings at his campsite. The letter probably was written late last year when Blackburn was visiting her family in Georgia, Miller said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, Salvo mentions Arthur one of the men who is charged with killing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have been very good to Kenny, while you have been gone,&quot; the letter says. &quot;I have bought him food and drink, cooked for him and gave him money. I tried to keep him out of trouble. . . . I guess most of the reason is so I can keep in touch with you through him, and because I have known Kenny for some years. I know how helpless he can be when he drinks.&quot;",0.0394370791246,0.427052819865,786 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"September 23, 1991 Monday",292 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Random thoughts:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't it make you feel good all under that Duke has finally won a basketball championship? Especially since it figures that the bet is now paid off and coach Mike Krzyzewski can get a real haircut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tough as this week must be on former Buccaneers placekicker Donald Igwebuike, what with his heroin trial and all, he can at least take heart in this: Ray Perkins isn't on the jury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Charles Barkley should have been suspended for a lot longer than one game for spitting on a fan in New Jersey. But you have to understand: Charles never expelled anything from his mouth before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the Pirates are trying to get rid of Bobby Bonilla, is it too early for the Tampa Bay baseball franchise to get involved?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anyone else fighting post-Plan B depression?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be deciding if you can tolerate the WLAF, but you have to love this wonderful new toy called the HelmetCam. And you have to figure that, any day, it's going to catch someone like Orlando's Kerwin Bell scoping the cheerleaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a lot easier to feel sorry for Sugar Ray Leonard and his plight with drugs if not for this: The news of his drug use almost obscured his admission that he had physically abused his ex-wife, Juanita. That's where the sympathy stops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case you're wondering, &quot;Krzyzew-ski&quot; would score 126 points on a triple-word score in Scrabble.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With major-league baseball teams cutting high-priced players on the hour, how long do you think it will be before someone actually asks to have his contract reduced? Uh, would someone tell Rafael Ramirez where the line starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sure Rocket Ismail is going to Canada as soon asNikeintroduces a line of snowshoes. Face it, the guy has turned his future over to the cash register, and that spells NFL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jerry Tarkanian really does leave UNLV, what's the bet he ends up as the bad guy in the next James Bond movie? (They lose in the end too).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in case the National League Expansion Committee comes back, shouldn't we make cardboard cutouts of a few skyscrapers and scatter them around St. Petersburg?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world would pay a lot closer attention to the women's tennis tour if a few more of the top 10 players had their drivers' licenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not Bobby Bonilla, could the Tampa Bay baseball team at least sign Bo Jackson? Maybe his rehab would be over in time to help the team in its first run for the pennant. Maybe not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Roger Craig has left the San Francisco 49ers for the L.A.  Raiders, you have to wonder: Are the already pass-happy 49ers ever going to run the ball again?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were Evander Holyfield, I'd rather fight George Foreman twice than mess with ex-wife Paulette. Paulette who sort of comes across as a Robin Givens wannabe had previously agreed to a divorce worth between $ 3-million and $ 4-million, but now she wants to renegotiate. What? Weren't the incentive clauses strong enough?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it. If you had won the $ 15-million Lotto last week, you would still have $ 450,000 less than Dwight Gooden's new contract.

After studying the upside, the downside and having someone translate the medical side, the chairman of the Chicago White Sox made what he termed a sound business decision: His team would go for Bo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White Sox struck a deal with Bo Jackson, the two-sport superstar who was released last month by Kansas City because of a hip injury the team felt would prevent him from playing baseball again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson agreed to terms with the White Sox on a one-year contract with two additional years at the club's option that guarantees him at least $ 700,000 for this season and could be worth $ 8.15-million for the three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think the risk is very large,&quot; Reinsdorf said Wednesday, &quot;and the reward is incredible.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not contractually required to play this season but said he hoped to return to the field sometime after the July 9 All-Star Game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Realistically, we don't expect him until 1992,&quot; said White Sox vice president Ron Schueler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract is keyed to Jackson's recovery from the injury, which could make his hip the most-watched since Madonna's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal includes a guaranteed base salary of $ 700,000 and an additional $ 10,000 for each game he is available to play this season up to 80. He could earn $ 1.5-million, plus the $ 391,484 Kansas City owes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1992 option, Jackson would make his 1991 earnings less $ 100,000, plus bonuses of $ 10,000 for each game available up to 150, for a maximum of $ 2.9-million. Under the 1993 option, he would make his 1992 earnings plus bonuses of $ 10,000 for each game available, with a maximum salary of $ 3.75-million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1992 salary would become guaranteed if Jackson is available for 40 games this season, including 30 after Aug. 31. The 1993 salary would become guaranteed if Jackson plays 125 games in 1992.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is not limited from continuing his football career under the contract and said he would not change his plans to continue his two-sport career. The running back is entering the final season of a five-year deal with the Los Angeles Raiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raiders executive assistant Al LoCasale told the Associated Press the team expects Jackson to play football again and to report at the &quot;middle of the season, just as we have the past four seasons.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Sox have some sort of protection in the contract regarding football, agent Richard Woods said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and Woods said they had been contacted by more than half the 26 major-league teams, but declined to name other suitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was made over the weekend to sign with the White Sox because of the team's talent, youth and potential. &quot;Of all the teams in the league, the White Sox have the best chance of going out and getting the ring,&quot; Jackson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors were the quality of the team's medical and rehabilitative staff, the grass field, the large market, and the chance to stay in the American League, Woods said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This was not an auction to the highest bidder,&quot; Woods said. &quot;We could have gotten a helluva lot more money if we shopped it around like a free-agent situation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is making good progress in recovery from the injury, according to Dr. James Andrews, the Birmingham, Ala., physician supervising Jackson's recovery. Jackson will check in with Andrews in a month and a decision on playing again this season will be made at the All-Star break, Andrews said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinsdorf said that timetable is fine with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I approached this with the idea that he won't play this season and felt it was a sound business decision,&quot; Reinsdorf said. &quot;If he is able to play this year, then that's a bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I also evaluated it on the basis that he might never play and concluded that it was a sound business risk worth trying.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson injured his hip Jan. 13 in the Raiders' playoff victory over Cincinnati and has been on crutches since then. The Royals released him March 18 when their team physician said Jackson should not play baseball this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrews said Jackson has a bruise to the bone in his left hip and damage to the cartilage around the hip socket. But he said it is not a typical avascular necrosis, a disease in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, and thus &quot;not a typical prognosis.&quot; He said there is &quot;excellent potential&quot; for Jackson to heal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson said Wednesday he could walk without crutches and without pain and felt like a &quot;caged animal&quot; waiting for Andrews to give him the okay to begin running.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Sox made the decision to sign Jackson after their orthopedic surgeon, Dr. James Boscardin, examined Jackson's medical records, and after all 26 teams passed on claiming Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson wore a White Sox cap and held a No. 8 jersey at the news conference and made it clear he liked the idea of going to Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll share the spotlight there with Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan. Jackson and Jordan are two of sports' biggest celebrities and are the stars of major advertising campaigns forNike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods said there will be an announcement next week about an unrelated ad campaign involving Jordan and Jackson, and said he would contactNikeabout the possibility of a joint program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Sox players greeted the news of Jackson's signing with mixed reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First baseman Frank Thomas, who played with Jackson at Auburn, said White Sox management asked him last week if Jackson was worth signing. &quot;I said of course,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;He's the type of person who will elevate everyone.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitcher Jack McDowell, one of several young White Sox players who has complained about his salary, was less complimentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to hold my tongue on it now about where this magic money is coming from. There's nothing you can do about it,&quot; McDowell said. &quot;Maybe he can get me a pair of cleats.Nikewon't give me any more because I paint the stripe black.&quot;",0.104298941799,0.288699924414,1025 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 30, 1991 Sunday",294 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Tampa businessman Woody Bell enjoys spending money on his men's all-star team, especially when the returns make Bell Corporation a world slow-pitch power.&nbsp;Bell began his big-dollar spending spree four years ago. The desire to own and operate a powerhouse club that would destroy opposition became an obsession. That's when Bell started scouring the nation and acquiring the superstars of the sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampa-based Bell Corporation is among the top five Super Open Division teams competing under any association Amateur Softball Association, United States Slow-pitch Softball Association or Independent Softball Association.&nbsp;Bell Corporation is rated in the same class as Steele's Sports, which set a world record in 1990 by winning 142 consecutive games. In fact, Woody's Bell Bombers defeated Steele's three times last summer, including the victory halting Steele's amazing win streak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell Corporation has just one local player on its roster, star first baseman Mark Hierlmeier of Tampa. But the team still will be worth watching Saturday night in a three-game exhibition against local all-star teams at the Greco Complex.&nbsp;Bell takes on the Pinellas County All-Stars at 5, the Hillsborough County All-Stars at 7, then a combination of the two teams at 9.  Admission is free.&nbsp;&quot;We hope people in the Bay area who enjoy softball, seeing long home runs and watching some of the world's best players come out and see the team Saturday,&quot; Bell said. &quot;This is our first get-together of the year, and it should be a lot of fun for everyone.&quot;&nbsp;Bell Corporation posted a 71-22 record last season, placing third in the USSSA and ISA Super Open World Tournaments. The team's 13 players averaged 14 home runs and 36 runs per game. Among the top players is former major-league veteran infielder Doug Flynn (shortstop).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players live around the country, traveling by airplane to tournaments. Bell estimates this year's budget will run between $ 175,000 and $ 200,000, but he's receiving major financial support from several national sponsors.&nbsp;Louisville Slugger is supplying money, bats, batting gloves and bat bags. Wilson Sporting Goods is giving money, gloves, uniforms, traveling shirts, warm-ups and balls.Nikeis providing cleats and other footwear.&nbsp;&quot;These people are so important to our success and financial backing,&quot; Bell said. &quot;Without them, we could not get the job done like we do.&quot;&nbsp;Tournament result: Denning's Lounge (32-11) posted a 5-1 record en route to the USSSA men's Class B national-qualifying tournament championship Sunday at the Eddie C. Moore Complex in Clearwater. Denning's, 6-2 and tied for first place in the Tampa City League's Pacific Division, bounced back from an opening-round loss to win five straight and claim the title, plus a national berth Labor Day weekend in Fort Walton Beach.  Sarasota's Babe's Plumbing was second, Tampa's Buddy Bi-Rite placed third and Brandon's Bernico's finished fourth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Denning's, shortstop Chris Gabbard had the most home runs (four), leftfielder Vince Miniet collected the most hits (12-for-20) and pitcher Wilson Feick (12-for-19, 5-1 record) was the most valuable player. Second baseman Mo Collins (10-for-17) and left-centerfielder Billy Turner (12-for-21) also contributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players needed: The Tampa Sharks slow-pitch team is seeking players ages 49 through 59 to play in a 35-team state league. The schedule features monthly tournaments. In addition, 50-and-over and 60-and-over teams play double-headers Saturday mornings.

"&nbsp;The Alamo International diving meet came down to the final dive Sunday as Germany's Jan Hempel came from behind to beat China's Sun Shuwei in the men's platform event. The event at the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale was Hempel's first international win since the unification of Germany last year. &quot;Both times I've competed in the U.S. I've won,&quot; smiled Hempel, referring to his victory at last year's Goodwill Games in Seattle. &quot;I like it here.&quot; Hempel wasn't smiling when Sun, the 15-year-old World platform champion at last week's VII FINA World Cup meet, built up an 11.81 point lead, heading into his 10th and final dive. But he overshot his mark on the reverse 3 somersault, scoring just a 63.24, and falling short, 637.44 to Hempel's 644.49. Dmitri Sautin of the Soviet Union won the bronze at 635.37.

Slaney, who rarely loses to an American and rarely loses on her home track, Hayward Field, was beaten Saturday night by Shelly Steely in the 1,500-meter race at the Oregon Twilight meet. &quot;It came down to a sprint and I don't have that extra gear yet,&quot; Slaney said.

"&nbsp;Mark Martin won the pole Wednesday for the Coca-Cola 600 by being the fastest of four drivers to break the year-old event record at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Martin had a top lap of 174.820 mph in his Ford Thunderbird to win his 13th career pole.  Ken Schrader, Michael Waltrip and Sterling Marlin also broke the event qualifying mark as the top 20 starting positions were filled.  The remainder of the 40-car field for Sunday's event will be determined in time trials today. In an unprecedented move, the sanctioning body for stock car racing's top circuit reduced the 12-week suspension of car owner Junior Johnson for using an oversized engine. NASCAR commissioner Semon E. Knudsen, the final route of appeal, trimmed the suspension to four races less than three hours after officials announced that an appeals panel had refused to ease the suspension. Johnson's team prepared to continue racing without the owner and crew chief beginning with Sunday's Coca-Cola 600.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal published a photo of Perry sitting in a seat behind the UNLV bench at the Florida State game Dec. 22.  The seat was one of 25 given toNIKEshoe representative Sonny Vaccaro, who promoted the game. Vaccaro said Thursday he gave the seats to either UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian or the coach's friend, casino host Mike Toney. Tarkanian said he didn't know Perry was at the game, and that it would not be fair to link him to Perry's presence at the game because the seats were in Vaccaro's name.

"&nbsp;The hopes of one British family to become permanent residents of the United States may well rest on an 8-foot by 4-foot collection of plywood, nets and ramps designed to teach children how to kick and head a soccer ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its creator, Alan Ball, is hoping to turn the invention dubbed Ball-E-Wall into the hottest sports item sinceNikeAir Jordans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more than money at stake here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ball is hoping the Ball-E-Wall will be enough of a commercial success to warrant a small manufacturing plant in St. Petersburg.  Even better would be for a major sporting goods company to buy the rights to the product and pay Ball a lot of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I could buy a business,&quot; says Ball. &quot;I could buy a McDonald's and employ 30 people.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, Ball needs to start a business that will employ enough American citizens to satisfy immigration authorities that his business is necessary to the area's economy. Then, authorities will let him and his family stay in St. Petersburg, rather than forcing them to return to England.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the Balls face the very real prospect of having to leave the States in the not-too-distant future. Their visas have expired and they are appealing the Department of Immigration's denial of an application for a permanent visa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Balls own two trailer parks in St. Petersburg, they manage the concerns themselves and employ only three part-time workers. That's not enough, according to the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After searching unsuccessfully for a business they could afford that employed enough people, Ball decided to try to make a go of a product he started developing eight years ago &quot;when I realized Americans can't kick a ball. They can throw anything, but they can't kick,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that there weren't enough walls to use for kicking against, so he devised a portable one. He added two angled wings on either side and a net across the top to keep the ball from going over the wall. Finally, Ball devised ramps to attach to the top and bottom of the back wall that lift the ball up in the air. Without the ramps, a player can practice kicking, chasing and dribbling the ball. With the ramp, players can practice heading the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ball-E-Wall will be unveiled officially this weekend at the Sports and Recreation exhibit at the Florida Suncoast Dome. Ball said he is anxious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I stayed up until 3 o'clock in the morning last night doing the voice over for the video,&quot; Ball said Monday. &quot;Barbara kept saying, &quot;Nobody will understand it, you have to sound more American.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight years in the United States have not erased the British accent from Ball's speech. He has the most difficulty pronouncing the name of his own product. When he says it, it sounds more like &quot;Bowl-E-Woll.&quot; He tries broadening his vowels, but can't get it quite right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered having one of his children narrate the video. Dean, 21, the eldest, retains a trace of London in his voice. Adam, who was 9 when he came to live in the States, has no trace of a British accent.  And 10-year-old Karly is, as Ball puts it, a &quot;typical American Tom-boy.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the family wants to return to England, although Barbara and Alan would like to visit their elderly parents. But because their visas are expired, they would not be able to re-enter the Unites States if they left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent residency has been the Balls' intention since they moved here in 1983. On the advice of an individual touting himself as an &quot;immigration consultant,&quot; Ball invested $ 300,000 in two trailer parks in St. Petersburg. He thought the investment would not only generate income but satisfy government requirements for permanent residency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received an L-1 or &quot;inter-company transfer&quot; visa and was &quot; assured that after five years they could apply for permanent visas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Balls faithfully renewed the visa every year or two. In 1986, Ball gave the immigration consultant $ 900 to file for citizenship for the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the last I ever saw of him,&quot; said Ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They learned through another immigration consultant that an L-1 visa cannot be converted into the necessary E-2 or &quot;treaty investors visa.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L-1 visa ran out in May 1989. Immigration has twice denied the Balls' request for permanent visas. They don't expect to hear a decision on the second appeal until the end of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, they have spent more than $ 10,000 in the process, not to mention the money invested in the trailer parks and their home or the money being used to create and market Ball-E-Wall.&nbsp;",0.157974747475,0.40162962963,788 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 1, 1991, Friday, City Edition",302 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;Keil, 24, shocked the ninth-ranked Sampras in the second round of the Stella Artois Championships, easily making for the biggest moment in what had been an obscure tennis career. Then, two weeks ago, he plowed through the Wimbledon qualifying rounds, beating up-and-comer Bryan Shelton along the way, to earn his first spot in the Wimbledon main draw. There he lost to Britain's Nick Brown in the first round 6-4, 7-5, 6-1.Don't bother Mark Keil right now. He's in a world all his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dangling from the lower rungs of the pro tennis world, the former University of South Florida player is still floating from his upset last month of U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's been everything you dream of,&quot; Keil said from his Tampa home. &quot;If someone had told me when I was at USF that I would beat the U.S. Open champ and make the Wimbledon main draw, I would have laughed in their face. But, you know, if you work hard, dreams come true.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keil's dreams didn't come easy. He broke his foot one week after leaving USF a year and half early in 1989 to turn pro. That same year, he broke the same foot twice more. As a result, Keil's ranking plummeted from the mid-200s to No. 885.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I almost packed it in,&quot; said Keil, who has a private sponsor who supports his tennis career. &quot;I went back to school for a semester and everyone was saying &quot;Hey, I thought you turned pro?' I went back (to the tour) because I had to prove to myself that I could do it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Keil's ranking is still only 174, it may not seem like he's proved much. But, to him, the real accomplishment is in feeling like he belongs. After the Sampras victory, he said top-ranked Stefan Edberg congratulated him on his win. And at Wimbledon, veteran Jimmy Connors practiced with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before, people didn't know me from a bar of soap,&quot; said Keil, who is coached by Alan Webb of Germany and sometimes by USF men's coach Eric Hayes. &quot;It's just nice to finally get the respect of your peers, to finally have your colleagues know you're alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's about time, huh?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossman just doing it: Seems Andre Agassi isn't the only one who may wake up the country club with loud, blinding clothing.

"&nbsp;The spikes were flying as almost 4,000 players on 289 teams from 38 states took to the courts Tuesday for the opening day of the United States National Junior Olympic Volleyball Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play began at 8 a.m. and continued late into the night on 24 courts at the Tampa Convention Center and three courts each at the University of Tampa and the University of South Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top seeds in each age division went undefeated in the first day of pool play. Three California teams led the boys divisions as Sunkist/Rip it Up, Santa Monica Beach Club and Balboa Bay Volleyball Club 14 Blue finished atop their pools in the 18-and-unders, 16s and 14s, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the girls, Sports Performance 181 from Chicago andNikeIchiban 16 Red from California each went 3-0 for the day in the 18s and 16s, respectively.

"&nbsp;Julie Edwards got a dose of reality when her team, Sports Performance from Chicago, defeated San Luis Obispo 9-15, 15-13, 15-11 Saturday afternoon at the University of Tampa in the girls 18s final of the National Junior Olympic Volleyball Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not often that your dreams come true, but this time they did,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;The last time we won it I was in eighth grade, and I remember watching that match, hoping I could play in a match like it someday. So it was great a dream come true.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides winning the national championship, Edwards was named as a first team All-American and won Player of the Year honors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The win marked the fourth time in four meetings this year that Sports Performance, seeded first, has beaten SLO, seeded second. It was the third match to go three games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We knew this year that it was going to be a dogfight between us and them,&quot; Sports Performance coach Rick Butler said. &quot;It was a great tournament. Of course, when you win, it's always a great tournament.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another team from the same club, Sports Performance Red, took third place in the girls 18s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other action, Borinquen Gardens of Puerto Rico defeated California's Santa Monica Bay Club 15-10, 15-7 in the boys 16s final.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two California teams dueled for the girls 16s championship with top-seededNike/Ichiban beating Asics Tiger Volleyball Club 15-8, 15-7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunkist/Rip it Up from California defeated Outrigger Canoe Club from Hawaii 15-6, 17-15 in the boys 18s final, but because it was Rip it Up's first loss in the double elimination Gold Championships bracket, there was a one-game playoff.

"&nbsp;Like an aging warrior, a battered camper rumbles into the parking lot of Media Ventures studios on a recent afternoon, coming to rest next to a Mercedes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian Paskowitz, 70, the slender, white-haired patriarch of America's foremost surfing family, jumps out toting a video camera in one hand and a bag of bagels in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, there's my son Israel,&quot; he says excitedly, gesturing toward a crowd of young men and women huddled together near the recording studio entrance. &quot;Will he come down here looking like a human being? No? He grows a Fu Manchu beard and winds up looking like Rita Hayworth after a bad night.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz, a Stanford University doctor who abruptly junked a lucrative private practice to roam the world in a camper with his wife and nine children, has brought his brood to town to record a song written by his eldest son, David, 32. The song, It's Real, is inspired by the family's unusual past most of which was spent living a mobile existence in a tiny camper in search of the next wave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious blend of Swiss Family Robinson and the Partridge Family, the Paskowitzes traveled their own world. From the clear, lukewarm waters of the Mediterranean to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, their motto remained the same: to take only what they needed to survive, eat simply, live clean and surf whenever possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the family's only home was a blue camper 96 inches wide, 78 inches high and 20 feet long. They figured that there was just enough room to allow each child 3 cubic feet in which to grow up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsiders were quick to dismiss the clan as a sorry freak show, a ragtag bunch of unschooled youths whose parents were crazy to raise them without basic necessities such as a house, formal education, Boy Scouts and Little League.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that they are all grown up, the Paskowitz children, ages 16 to 32, are the envy of many conventional parents. No one is strung out on drugs or serving time behind bars. Everyone can read and write. Unlike their parents who shunned society entirely, each of the Paskowitz offspring has struck out on his or her own career.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz children's names read like a Who's Who of biblical history:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, who lives in San Clemente, is the lead singer for a surfing rock band. Jonathan, 30, is a world-class long board surfer and partner in a skateboarding company in San Clemente.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham, 29, lives in a two-story Victorian in San Francisco and markets surf wear. Israel, 28, lives in San Clemente and is a world-class long board surfer who modeled surf wear forNike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses, 26, runs a surfboard marketing company in San Clemente.  Adam, 25, a singer who lives in the Los Angeles area, recently signed a recording contract with a SBK Records. Salvador, 23, a San Clemente-based graphic artist, has designed a surfing comic strip called &quot;Riders of Steel&quot; that will soon be made into a television cartoon show.  : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only daughter, Navah, 21, a model, shares an apartment in San Clemente with Salvador and Joshua, 16, the youngest, who works for Jonathan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conspicuously absent from the recording session is Adam, who has changed his last name and cut all ties with his unconventional family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're pretty lucky to come out the way we did,&quot; Jonathan says.  &quot;But when you boil it down, we are the most normal people I have ever met.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior Paskowitz, who still spends most of the year living in a camper in Cabo San Lucas with his wife Juliette, maintains that their family secret was really quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;(If) you want kids, then you're supposed to take care of them,&quot; Paskowitz said. &quot;I told my wife shortly after our honeymoon that what I wanted her to do was at least the same that animals do for their babies. Animals in the wild take care of their kids, and the first thing they do is hold them near.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz, who graduated from Stanford Medical School in 1946, says he quit his medical practice before his eldest son was born because he decided that it was impossible to work 40 to 50 hours a week and raise a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he and Juliette, a classically trained opera singer from Mexico, opted to devote all of their energies to their children. &quot;We were willing to give up some of the things that in a whole lifetime people will find out are less than fulfilling,&quot; Paskowitz said.  &quot;Juliette and I used to wake up our kids at night just to play with them.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paskowitz would offer his services at low-income hospitals across the United States and in Mexico. He supplemented his income by writing a series of health-related articles for Surfer magazine, stressing the importance of clean, healthy living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where their travels took them, every summer the family would return to their private Shangri-La the Paskowitz Surfing Camp in San Onofre, Calif. Here, they rubbed elbows with the sons and daughters of oil executives, newspaper publishers and other advantaged youths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paskowitzes hope that cutting a record will be a first step toward bringing their unconventional version of the American&nbsp; dream to the silver screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In true Hollywood fashion, they have hired an agent to peddle their product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it is very likely that it will become part of the sound track to a television movie,&quot; said Matt Weaver, who paid the $ 400 fee for the four-hour studio session.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a strange way, the Paskowitzes and Hollywood seem a perfect match.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All our lives people have said, &quot;You're the famous Paskowitz family,' but we were never famous. We were poor surfer boys,&quot; says Abraham. &quot;But one of the things that will make us famous is our love. That bond that gave us a chance to do everything we ever wanted.&quot;&nbsp;",0.0564301417537,0.513920634921,981 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"April 4, 1991, Thursday, City Edition",306 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;The boom for distance runners didn't really begin in 1972, when Frank Shorter won the Olympic marathon in Munich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really began when Shorter was 11 years old, in a private school with a strict dress code in upstate New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When I was younger, I wanted to be a downhill ski racer,&quot; said Shorter, who stopped in Tampa Bay Thursday on his way to the Sunshine State Games in Bradenton. &quot;I read about all my ski heroes in the '60s. They were the first skiers to do off-season training and they ran. I said, &quot;Well, I'll start running.' And the way I started was by running to and from school about 2 miles away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somehow I talked the teachers into allowing me to wear sneakers in school because I ran in them. Not only that, in gym class I convinced the gym teacher to let me run around the field during gym class rather than play touch football. Somehow I convinced them that I was training to become this ski racer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I found that I was a better runner than a skier.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shorter was the best in those '72 Games. He won an event that was the domain for Africans and Europeans, the first U.S. marathon winner since 1908. He was an All-America kid who won something besides the mile. And it changed the nation's outlook on distance running.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was the first time anyone could remember an American that won a marathon,&quot; said Jimmy Carnes, Shorter's track coach at Florida and a former president of The Athletics Congress. &quot;At the time I was coaching, I thought it was the beginning of a dynasty.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a dynasty forNikeand Reebok and Adidas and every other company that manufactured running shoes. They called it jogging. Now, thanks to Shorter, everyone runs. President Bush.  Madonna. They run far and for a long time. On lunch breaks.  Between business meetings. It spelled relief for stress. And the fitness craze began for a country known for its high food consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mile used to be the American event. But now, longer is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What it did was it started people thinking well, if this person can do that, maybe I should give this a try,&quot; Shorter said. &quot;Maybe this distance isn't so mystical and unattainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot of Americans started running and found out they liked to do it for the same reasons I did. It's a very personal kind of goal-setting.  Distance running appeals to the American idea of seeing a goal, realizing it's attainable, and saying &quot;I really can run the Boston Marathon.' '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though people from all walks of life run for exercise, no American has won the Olympic marathon or the 10,000 meters since Shorter broke the tape in 1972.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's not the important factor to Shorter, who rested in Tampa during the torch tour for the Sunshine State Games. The eight-day, 480-mile run that began in Miami ended Friday night in Bradenton, site of the 1991 Games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between training for his biathlons and running his sportswear business, Shorter is one of the torch carriers for the Games. To him, the Games are a way for athletes to try different sports, like he did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the reasons I think it's important to support these Games is you've got 40 sports and you've got all sorts of kids, and with all that diversity, you're going to be able to expose these kids to all different sports,&quot; Shorter said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're not talking sending kids to the Olympics. It's good for everybody to have something else they can do. For many children that can be sports.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorter just wants the kids to discover the joy in sports as he did.  And he still enjoys the running, at age 43, and the competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like beating guys who say &quot;Yeah, you're my dad's favorite runner,' &quot; Shorter said. &quot;It's sort of fun.&quot;",0.231658476658,0.415798525799,637 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"April 10, 1991, Wednesday, City Edition",307 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;The first running shoe was worn by cross-country runners in ancient Greece. There was not, contrary to popular belief, a marathon at the ancient Olympics. There was something called the stade-race or dromos, roughly 192 yards, and the dolichos, which was 24 dromos, enough to make a marching band.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoes were not shoes at all, but were boots made of solid bronze, three inches thick, which is why all races were mistaken for marathons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sporting fashion had been around for a while; it was introduced shortly after the great warrior Achilles was killed by an arrow to the heel. The boot forced the invention of a special running technique that involved striding with the arm and leg simultaneously. Examples of this technique can be seen in ancient Greek art.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, there were a number of noted runners, like Arthroscopos of Crete, who reportedly had no joints below his waist, and Meniscus of Sparta, who supposedly had legs so strong that he stood in for Atlas during bathroom breaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sign of discontent came during the Greek-Persian war in 490 b.c. A messenger called Pheidippides ran 22 miles from Marathon to Athens to bring news of the Greek victory. Falling exhausted at his destination, and in a hallucinatory rapture, he spat out one word, &quot;Nike', which roughly translates into either &quot;We won ',&quot; &quot;I need some cross-training shoes&quot; or &quot;I'm an actor, not an athlete&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another runner, Deerfoot, inspired another shoe design in the mid-19th century. Deerfoot, otherwise known as Louis Bennett, was the first great American distance athlete. He competed in England in the 1860s, had a seven-foot stride, set a record for the greatest distance covered in an hour (11 miles, 970 yards), and introduced uneven pacing to running. Before his era, entrants would run as a pack for most of the race, kick like mad the final mile, then collapse and occasionally die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of gaining credit as the first competitor who was smart enough to keep from killing himself, Deerfoot, a Native American who ran in a loincloth and an eagle's-feather headdress, became cross-country running's first &quot;natural&quot; athlete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deerfoot wore moccasins instead of the traditional pedestrian's spikes, causing some observers to attribute his success to his footwear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It bloomin' gotta be the shoes,&quot; said British expatriate shoemaker, Mark Blacksmith, who then constructed the first&nbsp; all-natural athletic shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model was introduced in America in 1863: leather moccasins treated in a special solution made of fish liver oil and oat bran. They caught on briefly, especially among the younger set. But after a group of youngsters posing as salesmen used the footwear as a ruse to get women to expose their calves, the shoes were banned in this country because of their association with gang activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1925, a year after the intellectual Finn Paavo Nurmi's double victory at the 1924 Olympics, an American scientist called Irving Piltdown made his contribution to running-shoe design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurmi had a habit of running against, not his competitors, but the clock, carrying a stopwatch during races to measure himself against pre-set goals. Inspired by the Platonic theory of forms and spurred on by Nurmi's success, Piltdown, himself a runner, set out to design the perfect running shoe. After thousands of designs, all of them inconclusive, he gave up his search in 1931. He spent the rest of his time trying to find a way to get sunlight from cucumbers, attempting to prove motion was not an illusion, and designing domed playing fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the middle part of this century, the greatest runner was Czechoslovakia's brutally hard-training Emil Zatopek, a triple winner (5,000 and 10,000 meters and the marathon) at the 1952 Olympic Games. Czechoslovakians are used to hardships, because, as part of the Soviet Bloc, they were forced to read Russian literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954 a youngster named Brad Dunsel allegedly developed a shoe that would stand up under the hardest training, but he was crushed into a wafer after he allowed a B-17 bomber to be lowered onto his shoulders while wearing the shoes in 1955.",0.114238095238,0.396714285714,715 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"May 13, 1991, Monday, City Edition",308 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;I am always amazed and&nbsp;a tiny bit impressed when I meet someone who is way ahead of the curve when it comes to spotting a trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've met them, too: The woman who invented the idea of wearing running shoes with a business suit. Or the man who realized that ponytails and earrings are not just for women only.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free-lance trend spotters, you might call them, these people who have a natural ability to sense a trend coming in and to ride it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while I am not a person who falls into this category I still don't get, for instance, the torn-at-the-knees thing with jeans or why it's cool to say &quot;okay?&quot; at the end of every sentence I think I have spotted a real trend. Finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it is: Americans, I am convinced, are getting up earlier and earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my first inkling of this when for reasons I'd rather not divulge except to say it's a wise person who never runs out of cat food when she's about to leave on a weekend trip without her cats I wound up at the neighborhood supermarket at 5 o'clock. IN THE MORNING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, where I expected to find empty aisles and lineless checkout counters, I was shocked to find instead many dozens of people shopping and milling about. I watched in a dazed, Stepford-People kind of way, as they threw groceries into their carts. Stunned, I asked several of them why they were shopping at 5 o'clock. IN THE MORNING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority responded that it was part of their usual routine.  That it was the only time they had available for grocery shopping.  (A very small minority, incidentally, did cite &quot;cat problems&quot; as a contributing factor in their predawn shopping.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving home about 5:45 a.m., I noticed small but significant numbers of people on the streets. Running. Jogging. Walking.  Skipping. Others, carrying little duffel bags marked with such names asNikeand Adidas, were getting into their cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, at the workplace, I queried my colleagues about their morning schedule. Six out of six responded they arose before 7 a.m. Two of the men responded their working wives arose even earlier before 6 a.m. When asked why, the following reasons were cited: to swim, to do aerobics, to run, to read the newspapers, to get children ready for the day and, in the cases of the two working wives, to start their work day early so they could end it early.&nbsp;A poll reports that 40 percent of Americans are up by 6:15 and 65 percent arise by 7 a.m. a significant rise from figures reported 15 years ago when 30 percent of Americans were up by 6:15 and 51&nbsp; percent arose before 7 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you're probably wondering, why are we becoming a nation of early risers? Well, according to studies done and anecdotal material from anyone who was willing to talk to me here are the four major reasons: more babies, more working mothers, more people growing older and more people making longer commutes to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you probably want to know isn't this up-at-dawn lifestyle making everyone sleepier? Are we as a nation in danger not only of a budget deficit but of a sleep deficit?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is: No. See, what's happening is everybody's going to bed earlier. That's why you hear so many people calling in their dogs at 10 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. And why so many TV stations are moving their news programs from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. And why restaurants. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But . . .

"&nbsp;Nancy Palmer sat at the wheel of her black Lexus sedan and steamed as two rows of bumper-to-bumper traffic nudged along behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big marquise-cut diamond on her left hand sizzled as she held up the offending Sarasota newspaper ad, clearly stating that the new Gulf Coast Factory Shops opened at 10 a.m. Friday. It was now 10:30 a.m. and two men were turning away hundreds of cars, telling upset drivers that the ad should have said noon, not 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They made a lot of enemies by sending us on this wild-goose chase,&quot; she said. &quot;We may not be back.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched the cars a moment, then added: &quot;I heard they have Donna Karan in there. Do they?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she learned that the expensive New York women's clothier did have a shop in the new factory outlet center, Palmer bit her lower lip and slumped back into the car seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't always smooth Friday, but most of the thousands of people who came from all over west-central Florida endured the inevitable miscommunications, overflowing parking lots and hot, humid weather to look for that cherished prize: a deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talmadge Mathews, pastor of Ellenton's Church on the Rock, leaned on the lectern, drew close to the microphone and told the crowd gathered for the ribbon cutting: &quot;It's always a special time when we embark on a new start . . .&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once breaking her long, loping stride, a woman in a pale green tank top appeared from the parking lot, cut through the crowd and crossed right in front of Mathews, her gaze firmly fixed on Donna Karan's front door. She quickly reached it, but a look of bitter disappointment crossed her face when she discovered the door was still locked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a few minutes later, Mike Reschke, president of the company developing Gulf Coast Factory Shops, proclaimed, &quot;The stores are now open. Enjoy yourselves. Thank you.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right &quot; a man said as the crowd quickly melted toward favorite storefronts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bugle Boy children's clothing store, the Leather Loft, the Maidenform lingerie outlet, the Welcome Home shop all were jammed within minutes and stayed that way. People looked longingly at theNike,Etienne Aigner and Mikasa storefronts, which won't open until late next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen Meade of Bradenton reached into her Bugle Boy bag and held up her fistful of bargains, $ 9.99 boys tank tops being unloaded for 99 cents. Shorts that were $ 17 now sell for $ 9.99. But other prices in other stores were no better than a good sale at one of the region's retail department stores, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she return?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm coming back tonight with my daughter when she gets out of school,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;She's a teen-ager and growing fast.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model Charlotte Nielsen caused quite a stir when she emerged from Donna Karan in a red silk miniskirt suit. She walked easily through the crowd in the $ 900 suit selling for half that amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1 p.m., the mostly older crowd was giving way to young moms with baby strollers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few people seemed to be carrying lots of bags. Store personnel acknowledged that sales weren't especially hot, that comparison pricing seemed to be the order of the day. They predicted heavier sales over the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 36 shops opening this week and next are south of Tampa Bay at Interstate 75 and U.S. 301 in Ellenton. Reschke, the developer, told the crowd he hopes to draw on the millions of people that visit west-central Florida each year or who regularly use I-75 to traverse the state.  @ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using other outlet shopping centers as guides, he said the typical shopper drives three to four hours to reach the center, then spends another three to four hours shopping. By contrast, a shopper normally spends less than an hour at a regional retail store. Reschke predicted the Ellenton outlets will generate $ 3-million in state sales tax revenues each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen Eisenberg of Boston, visiting her parents in Bradenton, wasn't worried about tax revenues. She held up a cable-knit sweater she'd just bought at the Cape Isle Knit Shop and showed the tag, marked down from $ 78 to $ 59.99. &quot;It seemed like they had nice things that weren't too expensive,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she added, she was en route to the Coach Leatherware shop, where things can get very pricey. She had found a leather address book 20 percent cheaper than the same item back home not exactly the end of the world, &quot;but it's better than paying retail.&quot;",0.0632072372072,0.418823347593,760 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 1, 1991, Saturday, North Suncoast Edition",311 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Honest Abe Lincoln, staring down from his monument, is not the capital's top tourist draw. Nor is the White House, or even the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in a region liberally sprinkled with museums and monuments, what really packs 'em in is a shopping mall, 20 miles south of the Mall, in suburban Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 200 stores bragging about bargain prices, Potomac Mills discount mall draws more than 12-million people a year. They come for garbage cans and handbags, for lingerie and leather coats, for Swedish furniture and Icelandic sweaters. The deals are the draw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That success of the country's first discount megamall has inspired imitation elsewhere, including Fort Lauderdale. A smaller outlet mall opened Friday near Bradenton. Now that retailing trend inspires wistful what-ifs from the people who are trying to salvage St. Petersburg's downtown redevelopment project, Bay Plaza.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original concept for Bay Plaza, as a high-fashion shopping and entertainment district, is stuck in the quicksand of recession and troubles in the department-store trade. What if Bay Plaza lowered its sights and its price-range, and became an outlet or off-price district?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee Fowler, vice president of the developer that is in charge of Bay Plaza, said his company still is convinced the original concept would work, but also is considering the outlet option. &quot;We still have a lot of homework to do,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Means, a real estate consultant in suburban Washington, was fairly skeptical about Bay Plaza's chances when she studied the project three years ago, and she is not surprised to hear it is having trouble. But she calls an outlet mall &quot;an intriguing prospect&quot; for replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, the very problems that have dimmed the prospects for the original Bay Plaza plan actually improve the chances for an outlet mall, where the key word is cheap: cheap land, cheap construction, cheap rents and especially cheap prices.Potomac Mills&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is no longer the country's largest (Sawgrass Mills, outside Fort Lauderdale, was built by the same developer and is nearly twice the size) Potomac Mills remains a model for how outlet malls can work. At 1.2-million square feet, it is the same size as the original Bay Plaza retail plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first blush, Potomac Mills seems much like any other suburban mall, but with more parking outside and less finish inside. Steel roof beams and air conditioning ducts are exposed, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big difference is the kind of stores: manufacturers' outlets and discount shops that routinely mark down prices. Benetton, Laura Ashley,Nikeand Calvin Klein all have stores there. So do some big department stores, including Nordstrom's and Sears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all accounts, the biggest draw is a rambling Swedish furniture and housewares store called IKEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchandise runs the price-range gamut. You can buy a six-pack of Coca-Cola for $ 1.20. For bigger budgets, designer jeans by Escada that were on sale in St. Petersburg this summer for $ 200 a pair were a comparative bargain at $ 79 in a Potomac Mills store.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the stuff is first-quality; some of it is flawed, or last season's line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A record store had the latest compact disc from the rock group Guns N' Roses for $ 11.99, a dollar less than a chain of stores in Washington. But this sign in a Guess? outlet is also fairly typical: &quot;No returns or exchanges. Merchandise as is. All sales final.&quot; A store whose slogan is &quot;Clothing Bargains for Millionaires&quot; had a Wells Fargo security guard instead of a floor-walker posted inside the front door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the promise of good prices pulls shoppers from miles, even hundreds of miles, away. Potomac Mills sits next to I-95, and the parking lot is spotted with cars from other states, including Florida.  Last year, 2,357 buses disgorged tour groups at the mall, accounting for a quarter of total sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, according to the developer, Potomac Mills registered more than $ 200-million in sales last year, creating 2,500 jobs and $ 10-million in sales and property taxes for state and local government.St. Petersburg&nbsp;&nbsp;Those kinds of figures sound good almost anywhere, but especially in downtown St. Petersburg, where the number of department stores is headed in the wrong direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, a feasibility study of Bay Plaza commissioned by the St.  Petersburg Times concluded, among other things, that &quot;Tampa Bay isn't a Neiman-Marcus kind of place, at least not yet.&quot; Upscale stores need upscale shoppers. In all of Pinellas County, there are 35 houses appraised for taxes at $ 1-million or more; there are 159 such residences in Broward County, which is only somewhat larger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the authors of that 1988 study says now that outlet shopping might be a better fit for the area, especially in these troubled times. &quot;I don't think it's going to be an easy thing to do, but it's not undoable,&quot; said consultant Means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means and other real estate experts identify several important hurdles for outlet mall developments, but none of those hurdles seems impossibly high for the Bay Plaza project. The opening of Gulf Coast Factory Shops near Bradenton this week gives the region its third outlet center, although it is not clear how much they would compete with Bay Plaza, especially if it were much bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tampa Bay area has a big population base and attracts plenty of tourists. It's reasonably easy for all those people to reach St.  Petersburg on the two interstate feeders, north and south of downtown. City Hall's commitments, financial and otherwise, to Bay Plaza would be another plus, according to the real estate experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent economic reverses actually improve the chances for an outlet mall downtown. Maas Brothers' decision to close its department store reduces one potential obstacle: reluctance by manufacturers to set up shop in competition with the department stores that are buying their products wholesale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important is how much the recession may have depressed land values, and therefore store rents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offer low prices, outlet stores have to have low rents, no more than half what they would pay somewhere else. That's why the huge outlet malls are out in places that used to be the boondocks, where land is cheap. The developers at Potomac Mills, for example, paid about $ 1 a square foot for land, a fraction of downtown costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cities have smaller outlet centers downtown, but they tend to be in renovated factories or mills that had gone bust. Again, one key to the success of an outlet mall is the value of the land beneath it, and in downtown St. Petersburg, the trend line is still headed down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county property appraiser has dropped the valuation of the Florida Federal office tower from $ 27-million to $ 16-million in just three years, according to David Zachem, the appraiser's chief deputy. Office vacancy rates downtown are apt to be at 40 percent this year, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure anybody can tell you with authority&quot; what downtown land values are now, said Zachem. &quot;They have not stabilized yet.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the recession, land values downtown still are several times higher than in outlying areas. But commercial rent rates have plummeted, and now may be nearing a range that just might attract outlet stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't even hazard a guess about what market rates are in downtown St. Petersburg right now,&quot; said Fowler. He wouldn't disclose what rents Bay Plaza was quoting to potential retail tenants. &quot;What we were thinking of and what we were quoting were two different things.&quot;The right developer&nbsp;&nbsp;If St. Petersburg does try to turn Bay Plaza into an outlet mall, it might need a new developer, perhaps in partnership with the current one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate experts interviewed for this article said that it takes particular expertise and the right connections to put together an outlet mall. Which stores come to a project depends very much on which developer is behind it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a very small fraternity of developers who are capable of pulling these things off,&quot; said Patrick Phillips of Halcyon Real Estate Advisors in Washington. &quot;Outlet retailing has its own rules and its own relationships. The rules are changing almost daily.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay Plaza's current developer, J.C. Nichols Co. of Kansas City, Mo., built a successful high-fashion shopping district called Country Club Plaza, which is the model for Bay Plaza. But Nichols is not among the handful of developers with substantial background in outlet malls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partnership with a more experienced outlet developer is &quot;one of the things that we're exploring,&quot; said Fowler, but &quot;I won't be able to comment on the specifics of how we're exploring it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, a downtown project goes through more than one developer before it finally succeeds. In downtown Chattanooga, Tenn., it took a third developer to make an outlet project called Warehouse Row work. That company was the Prime Group, which just opened the Manatee County center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if all the other obstacles to an outlet mall project can be resolved, St. Petersburg would face one last question, a central one at that: What if outlet malls turn out to be a fad instead of a trend, replaced a few years from now by some hot new kind of retailing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, outlet malls like Potomac Mills look economically secure, and developers say demographic and other trends will assure their continued success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Outlet has been pretty strong for the last nine years,&quot; said Fowler, of Bay Plaza. &quot;I don't think it's a flash in the pan.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, an outlet mall would be the third theory for a retail project in downtown St. Petersburg during the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years ago, St. Petersburg voters rejected Pier Park, a proposal for a &quot;festival marketplace&quot; along the waterfront. Since then, similar projects have hit financial hard times in some of the other cities where they were built.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cities tend to look for panaceas&quot; to their downtown economic problems, said Phillips, of Halcyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a real trap that cities can fall into.&quot;&nbsp;",0.13288155207,0.446285067746,1738 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 4, 1991, Tuesday, City Edition",312 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;The Florida State Seminoles will join the nation's college basketball elite with their entrance this season into the Atlantic Coast Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they can succeed right away at that level won't be known for several months. But coach Pat Kennedy started trying to answer several questions with the beginning of practice Tuesday. And even he is unsure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have a lot of question marks,&quot; said Kennedy, who enters his sixth season at FSU with a 97-56 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think there are obvious ones: How quickly and how well can the kids adjust to Sam (Cassell) as the lead (point) guard? Is Andre Reid going to develop into a full-time center? How is this lack of depth going to affect us? And I think our lack of inside depth is going to force us to look at more three-guard situations.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seminoles have talent, and they've found themselves in the hunt for some of the nation's top recruits because of their affiliation with the ACC. But Kennedy admits the Seminoles lack depth, with the two seniors on his roster expected to be nothing more than backups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassell, a transfer from San Jacinto (Texas) Junior College, is projected as the starter at point guard. The team's leading scorer, Douglas Edwards (16.4 ppg), returns at small forward and will be joined by power forward Rodney Dobard (8.5 ppg), Reid at center (1.9 ppg) and shooting guard Chuck Graham (10.9 ppg).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is depth. Senior guard Derrick Myers left the program last week, so Kennedy is looking at freshman Ray Donald from Pensacola as his first guard off the bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampa's Byron Wells, who has beefed up to 230 pounds, is now considered the sixth man, although he's seen only limited action in the past and redshirted last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: The Seminoles on Tuesday received a verbal commitment from Erick Dortch, a 6-foot-6 swingman from Pensacola High School who is considered among the top 10 prospects in the country by two prep scouting magazines, Hoop Scoop and Future Stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dortch averaged 23.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, three steals and two assists per game last season. He was one of only five Floridians chosen for the prestigiousNikePrep All-Star camp in Indianapolis.  The first day national letters of intent can be signed is Nov. 15.BOB HARIGKruger has rebuilt Gators&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAINESVILLE They assembled at courtside in midafternoon for the first practice of the season. They brought with them high tops and high hopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they could have brought name tags to pin on their tank tops, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1991 University of Florida basketball team will bear little resemblance to the outfit that won the Southeastern Conference title in 1989. It will, for that matter, bear little resemblance to the squad that coach Lon Kruger trotted onto the court in his first season in 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 15 players on the roster, 10 have joined since Kruger's arrival in April 1990. Florida could end up starting as many freshmen as seniors this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The personality of this club will be unique. It'll be different from last year. We've got a lot of young guys that are out to make a start as opposed to older guys finishing out careers.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no more Livingston Chatman. No more Dwayne Davis. No more Renaldo Garcia for the Gators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will also be no more talk in the locker room about the good old days before the NCAA investigation and the tenuous tenures of Norm Sloan and Don DeVoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gators finished 11-17 last season. Not exactly a record to be proud of, but certainly better than the 7-21 mess of the year before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gators lack experience: Forward Stacey Poole is the only returning full-time starter. They lack height: Jeremy Ulmer (6-7) and Tim Turner (6-7) are early front-runners at center and they combined to average 2.7 points and 1.8 rebounds last season.  Andrew DeClercq, 6-10 freshman from Countryside, is also a strong contender at center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least this team is heading somewhere. It may not be a fast break, but the Gators are no longer sliding into oblivion.JOHN ROMANOOld Bulls in a new league&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAMPA While optimism is always at a zenith on the first day of practice, you'll have to pardon the University of South Florida Bulls for being especially upbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USF returns four senior starters guard Radenko Dobras, center Gary Alexander and forwards Fred Lewis and Bobby Russell from a team that finished 19-11, beat three NCAA Tournament participants and earned an NIT berth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This team is clearly the most experienced we've had here,&quot; Bulls coach Bobby Paschal said, &quot;and it's clearly had the most good experiences together.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bulls are entering a new ring: the Metro Conference, where they, North Carolina-Charlotte and Virginia Commonwealth join national powerhouses Louisville and Southern Mississippi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Metro games, the Bulls face perhaps their most demanding non-conference schedule in years: Florida State, Florida, Cincinnati, home-and-home with Texas Christian, and a potential game against Iowa in USF's Holiday Invitational.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all these expectations prompted about 3,000 fans to attend Tuesday's Midnight Madness celebration at the Sun Dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to see Alexander, a relentless rebounder (10.2 a game) and inside scorer (16.4 points), who this year may discard his cumbersome knee brace; Lewis, the captain; and Dobras, the 6-foot-7 guard from Yugoslavia who has led USF in scoring his first three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players worth watching, however, might be the newcomers.  Point guard Corey Allen, an All-American at Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College last year, could allow Dobras to move back to the shooting-guard spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick Sharp, the Florida Junior College player of the year last year at Brevard Community College; Gerard Arcement, a junior from Skyline (Calif.) Community College; and Mike Greene, a freshman from Miami Killian High, should bolster the Bulls' perimeter game and open up the inside for Alexander and Lewis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We always have high expectations,&quot; Paschal said. &quot;That expectation has not changed at any time. But we're optimistic if we play hard as a team, we can have a reasonable level of success.&quot;BRIAN LANDMANTeam rosters, page 2C",0.0881099960645,0.402795405352,1080 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"July 2, 1991, Tuesday, City Edition",313 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;About 30 miles north of Tampa, just off Interstate 75, is a sleepy little area of hills and orange groves called San Antonio.  Developers have yet to &quot;improve&quot; it. Miles of sandy roads spider past quiet farms. A small Catholic college, Saint Leo, is there. One can sit quietly, smell the orange trees when in blossom, maybe chat with one of the monks or nuns, or listen to the sweet chiming of the bell tower. It is also a good place to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Oct. 19, a mass of runners descended on San Antonio for the 1991 Rattlesnake Run, a 5-mile, part-road, part-field, all-hill endurance test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Petersburg's Ray Wunderlich III aced the exam with a 25:55 winning time. Wunderlich (with splits of 5:02, 10:16, 15:22, 20:32) broke away from Mexican Omar Albanil Marta with a strong surge just before two miles, then hung on for the victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wunderlich, who works forNike,said: &quot;I threw in a surge and when he didn't respond, I knew I had it. These hills were tough tougher than Lake to Lake (10K).&quot; Wunderlich placed fifth in the Lakeland race two weeks ago in 31:37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry Fluke of Tampa took second in 27:27, followed by Plant High School cross-country coach Roy Harrison in 27:30. &quot;I've only been able to do one speed workout this week (4x880) and I just didn't have it to challenge Fluke at the end. I do most of my running with my girls,&quot; said Harrison. His girls team won the Don Bishop Invitational in Brandon later that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesuit coach Dave Parrish, returning from injury, followed closely for fourth in 27:37. Marta, who recently finished a tour with the Mexican Army and is working in construction in Tampa, faded to fifth in 27:56. Former Tampa Catholic star Mark Bokor (third in the state in Class 3A cross country last year) finished sixth in 28:00.  Bokor is currently red-shirting a year at Saint Leo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The footing on this course was tough,&quot; said lawn service owner Dave Mitchell of Temple Terrace. Mitchell is a middle-of-the-pack runner who likes the challenge. &quot;I enjoy the camaraderie and the scenery is nice, but you don't have time to look at it. I especially like to party after the race. The guys who do this are great.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the women's division, masters runner Dianna Campbell won overall in a time of 32:49. Campbell, 42, of Lakeland, recently returned to college and is majoring in sports management at Florida Southern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda Nigles finished second in 33:42; Peg Miller was third in 33:58.&nbsp;",0.090204248366,0.344558823529,419 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"July 15, 1991, Monday, City Edition",316 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;The &quot;Open Letter&quot; appeared last week on Page 1 of the San Antonio Light and on the cover of the San Antonio Express-News sports section, and it didn't mince words. &quot;I'm finally fed up,&quot; David Robinson wrote to Spurs owner Red McCombs. &quot;I tried talking to you in a civilized manner. But obviously you didn't respect that because nothing has been done. Flying commercially puts us at a distinct disadvantage, especially when every other team that has a legitimate shot at winning the world championship has their own plane and are sleeping in their own beds.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, something is being done now. McCombs and Spurs officials are taking bids until Dec. 20 for charter flights. And if it took publicly challenging the man who pays his salary to get the results, then so be it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new David Robinson, one you wouldn't recognize from the Naval Academy, one you wouldn't recognize even from mid-summer, simply because this David Robinson didn't exist then.  This Robinson, changed since he decided to dedicate himself to Christianity, is getting married in 10 days. This Robinson, unlike the quiet, reticent man the sports world grew so comfortable with, isn't afraid to ruffle feathers as the team's new bold, forceful leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could illustrate this metamorphosis more than the letter to McCombs, which Robinson never would have written last season &quot;I thought about it a lot after I was saved this summer,&quot; he said Wednesday night. &quot;I needed to exert some of my influence. Nobody should blame you for doing that if your intentions are good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd been studying characters in the Old Testament, one in particular. When Moses died, the Lord told Joshua, &quot;Be strong, and no man will be able to touch you. Be strong and courageous because you will lead these people.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson knows he runs a risk of turning off fans because so many don't feel comfortable hearing about one's religious beliefs or Bible verses. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; he said softly, nodding in agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I used to think the same thing myself when some player started talking this way.&quot; And how do you justify quoting scripture on one hand, while publicly challenging the owner of the team on the other?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God doesn't want wimps,&quot; Robinson told the Light's Brad Townsend. &quot;He wants men. He wants warriors because this is not a joke. It's a war out there. It's a war between your soul and the devil.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson was observant and quiet, somewhat reluctant to be very vocal. Not now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I talked to Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley this summer when we were in Europe forNike,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;They told me my team is immature, that we had no chance to win. I got defensive, but really it was true. I needed to do more, to really be strong and&nbsp; take control when needed.&quot;Other news&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockets: Hakeem Olajuwon was activated from the injured list Saturday, two days earlier than expected.

"&nbsp;Teen-age girls danced and squealed as the rap group 3 Brothers Of Knowledge performed on a gym floor Friday afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the abundance of fuzzy red-and-white Santa hats, it was hard to tell this was the day before the holiday break at Booker T. Washington Junior High School near Ybor City.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh-graders at the junior high were treated to a day of rap music and Japanese Taiko drumming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought it was going to be stupid,&quot; said Remecia Hardy, 13, of Tampa. &quot;But it's neat. I'm glad I came to school.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rap group, known as 3 B.O.K., encouraged the teens in their rap songs to come to school and stay away from drugs. They also tried to remind the pupils that although some of them were looking forward to Christmas mornings full of gifts such as Nintendos andNikeshoes, there were others who wouldn't be so lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's Christmas, and you probably aren't thinking about the homeless,&quot; said group leader Greg Hunt, 21, of St. Petersburg, during a lull in the performance. &quot;But there are people who are starving throughout the year, and you need to remember them.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the pupils enjoyed the rap act, they weren't so sure about the Japanese Taiko Drummers, also from St. Petersburg. But they managed to keep the squirming and whispering to a minimum while Lorraine and Asoka Compton pounded on the giant drums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For this age group, sitting still and listening to music that's not from their world, they did real well,&quot; said substitute teacher Linda Chappell. &quot;They seemed pretty enthralled by it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pupils didn't come to school Friday. Instead, they started their holiday vacation a little early.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wasn't going to come. I was going to go to the mall,&quot; said Dante Lamar, 13, of Tampa. &quot;But my mom wouldn't let me stay home.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who came to school had similar plans of how to spend their time off: avoid studying (many left their books in their lockers) and sleep in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way in,&quot; said Jackie Johnson, 12, from Valrico.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas wishes were tempered by economic reality, and most of the pupils acknowledged that they weren't asking their parents for as many things this Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My mom is a kindergarten teacher, and she's working all by herself,&quot; said Chris Girard, 13, from Brandon. Although his classmates were cheering and screaming to the rap in the gymnasium, Girard was near tears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're really limited this year,&quot; he said. His father died in December last year, leaving his mother to care for him and his younger sister. &quot;We can't do as much as we want to do. My grandparents are helping out.

"BY GERALD FITZPATRICKSpecial to The Globe and MailMODERN Athens is noisy and polluted, its taxi drivers will often take youonly where they want to go, but it has an incomparable jewel at its heart.Floating serenely above the concrete confusion is the rock of theAcropolis. On its flattened top, the most glorious ruins of antiquity lookdown from another age and at its pinnacle stands the Parthenon, oftencalled the most perfect building in the world and the enduring symbol ofGreece.Inhabited since Neolithic times, the Acropolis has been battered andfought over constantly. After it was devastated by the Persians in 480 BC,the statesman-general Pericles began to rebuild the Acropolis on amonumental scale. In this brief &quot;Golden Age,&quot; the Parthenon was completedin 438 BC, followed by the Propylaia, the Temple of AthenaNikeand theErechtheion.&nbsp;For centuries, the city was occupied by a succession of conquerors whoeach added buildings and defences to the site. In 1687, during a longperiod of Turkish rule, the Acropolis was attacked by Venetian forces. Anexplosion rocked the Parthenon, which the Turks were using as a powdermagazine. Fourteen columns were blown apart cutting the temple in two.Fire raged for two days and the Turks surrendered the site for severalmonths.In 1833 the Turks were finally defeated and the modern Greek state wasborn. The new monarch, King Otho, wanted to build a new palace on theAcropolis, but fortunately his plans were rejected as too costly. Worksoon began to remove the clutter of buildings that had been added to theAcropolis since classical times, and restoration has gone on almostcontinuously ever since. During the past 50 years, however, deteriorationof the site from erosion has increased at an alarming rate. Ironreinforcing rods used in earlier restoration work caused serious marbledamage, but the effects of sulphurous pollution have been even worse. Ironreinforcement is now being replaced by titanium, and copies of survivingsculptures have been substituted for the originals.We stayed at the Hotel Phillipos, in the shadow of the Acropolis, onthree occasions between visits to other parts of mainland Greece and theislands. Each time we returned we were given a room on a higher floor.During our last visit, we had a room with its own roof terrace that lookedstraight up at the south side of the Parthenon: we saw the ancient templeglow in the morning sun, glisten at midday and turn pink in the sunset. Wesaw it by moonlight and floodlight. It was a view of which we never tired.On our first morning, we climbed the worn marble steps leading to theceremonial entrance of the Beule Gate. Beyond it was the Propylaia, amonumental gateway originally planned to extend across the entire width ofthe Acropolis. It was to be exactly as wide as the Parthenon was long, butwork stopped when the Peloponnesian War broke out and the building wasnever finished. The Propylaia remained almost intact until the 13thcentury when it was used as a Byzantine palace. It was severely damaged bylightning when it too was used as a Turkish powder magazine in the 17thcentury.Perched dramatically on a platform next to the south wing of thePropylaia is the little Temple of AthenaNike, one of the gems of theAcropolis, with an Ionic portico of slim fluted columns at either end.Built to celebrate the peace with Persia, it was destroyed by the Turks,reconstructed in the 1830s but dismantled and rebuilt again in the 1930swhen its foundation became insecure.We walked through the Propylaia, and before us, at the highest point ofthe Acropolis, stood the Parthenon. Built to honour the goddess AthenaPolias, it has 17 columns on each side and eight at either end, each morethan two metres wide at their base and 10 metres high.The precise mathematical skill that went into the design of theParthenon is astonishing. It is said that there is not a single straightline in the entire building: horizontal lines that seem straight and trueactually rise in the centre, while columns bulge half way up and thentaper toward the top. Pericles ensured that the finest sculptors in Athensworked on the decorative friezes surrounding the temple. He succeeded sowell that the Parthenon came to be looked upon by Athenians as an artisticmasterpiece rather than as a holy place.Until the Venetian offensive, the temple survived more or less intactfor about 2,000 years, serving in its time as a Christian church and aMuslim mosque - complete with a minaret. Sadly, the most serious damagecame from the ravages of 18th century antiquarians who began to removeparts of the Parthenon's decorative friezes. The most flagrant example ofthis, which still angers the Greek people, was by Lord Elgin, the Britishambassador to Turkey. In 1801, he was given permission to remove a largepart of the frieze and other figures, which are now in the British Museumin London.North of the Parthenon is the Erechtheion, the last temple built on theAcropolis, its fine detail acting as a delicate foil to the massiveParthenon. The Erechtheion's crowning feature is the south porch where thesupporting columns are in the form of six maidens, called &quot;caryatids&quot;after the women of Karyai on the Peloponnese peninsula. During the Turkishoccupation, the military governor housed his harem in the Erechtheion andthe caryatids were said to have blushed with shame. In the 19th century,moulds were taken of the original caryatids, which have now been replacedwith copies in order to prevent further deterioration.As we travelled around Athens, I kept looking for glimpses of theParthenon through the forest of television antennas bristling above theconcrete buildings. On our last day in the city, I went back to theAcropolis for a final visit. It seemed to draw me like a magnet. In spiteof the blinding sun and the crowds, I wanted to etch those images on mymind once more. As I left through the Propylaea, I turned and took onelast lingering look. There the Parthenon sat, battered and worn after2,400 years. I tried to imagine people staring up at this same timelessbuilding more than a thousand years ago. Called &quot;the emblem ofcivilization&quot; and &quot;the victory of order over chaos,&quot; the victory of theAcropolis' crowning gem seemed even more supreme as I took a deep breathand descended into the modern city.",0.0829406516907,0.425203287703,1051 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 5, 1991, Saturday, City Edition",320 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"The EconomistWHEN, late last year, PepsiCo Inc. unveiled a new television commercialin the United States sneering at the products of its perennial rival,Coca-Cola Co., not an eyebrow was raised.By the rough and tumble standards of U.S. advertising, where corporatebosses inveigh against foreign competitors and food companies have beenknown to accuse one another of causing cancer, the Pepsi ad seemed gentle.In it, a sip of Coke turns M. C. Hammer, a rap-music star who normallysounds as if he has several bits of gravel lodged in his throat, into asyrupy crooner. A swig of Pepsi, naturally, returns him to form.Tame stuff - or so it seemed until the commercial was broadcast inJapan. There it has sparked a furious legal row between the two companies,forcing the ad off the air after complaints to Japan's Fair TradeCommission.&nbsp;Although comparative advertising has been legal in Japan since 1987, itis frowned upon. But some Japanese ad people say that if the tradecommission rules in Pepsi's favour, it may become more acceptable. Inparts of Europe, where the tactic is known as &quot;knocking copy,&quot; it alreadyhas.As comparative advertising grows ever more popular - and pointed - inthe United States, governments around the world are under pressure toliberalize their rules.That pressure is coming directly from most ad agencies and some oftheir clients. Increasingly they see comparative advertising as aneffective way for new brands - especially fast-moving consumer goods - tobreak into markets, or for established but tired ones to regain lostmarket share.To bolster their case, they cite famous American success stories suchas Federal Express Corp., the overnight mail courier that establisheditself by knocking the leisurely U.S. Postal Service.But regulators remain wary. Free-market arguments supporting the freeflow of consumer information and lower barriers to market entry must bebalanced, they say, against the dangers of deceptive or slanderous ads andagainst &quot;intellectual property&quot; claims by companies over their brandedimages. In fact, comparative ads are not, in most cases, pernicious; butneither are they usually very effective.The folly of the regulators can be seen most plainly in Europe.Yesterday, the European Commission approved a proposal ostensiblypermitting comparative advertising in the European Community from 1993.But there is a catch, or rather, seven of them. All are limits that anyadvertiser would need to observe when knocking another brand.Taken together, the restrictions in effect ban all but the narrowest -and most commercially fruitless - comparative ads. Pepsi's M. C. Hammercommercial would be doomed in the EC unless the company could producescientific evidence of Coke's effect on Mr. Hammer's vocal chords.So would other image-based ads now in vogue in the United States, suchas those in the entertaining war being waged againstNikeInc.'s Air brandof athletic shoes by virtually all of its competitors. LA Gear Inc. chides&quot;Everything else is just hot air;&quot; British Knights, another competitor, isless artful: &quot;Your mother wearsNike.&quot;Comparative advertising has been common in the United States since themid-1960s. In that time, it has produced some of the country's mostbrilliant commercials - the Pepsi ad in which young people in the distantfuture find a relic (a Coke bottle) so ancient they cannot identify it;the famous ad for Wendy's, a fast-food restaurant, which jibed McDonald'shamburgers by asking &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;What comparative advertising has not done is show that it helps to sellproducts. Pepsi still lags far behind Coke; Wendy's does not have half ofMcDonald's market share.There are exceptions. According to research by Leo Burnett, a Chicago-based agency, a clever, well-executed comparative ad can be particularlyhelpful in two circumstances.The first is establishing a new brand against entrenched rivals:General Mills Inc. successfully launched its breakfast cereal Total bysaying it was the same as Kellogg Co.'s Corn Flakes but with morevitamins.The second is in a tightly contested market with lots of brands, wheretiny short-term gains are needed to stay profitable. There are more than200 brands in the $900-million U.S. breakfast-cereal market; only 31 ofthem have more than 1 per cent of it. Hence the use of comparative ads byvirtually all of them.But on the whole, says Chris Macrae, a brands consultant at CoopersLybrand Deloitte, comparative advertising makes little sense for anestablished brand. &quot;The brands that last are those that define themselvespositively, not in opposition to someone else,&quot; he argues. Market leadersoften gain nothing by giving their rivals free exposure, while brands thatknock market leaders tacitly admit they are not No. 1.Worse, an extended slugging match can simply subtract value from thewhole market. When Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. introduced Datril, a headachedrug that it advertised as identical to Tylenol only cheaper, Tylenolreduced its prices, dooming Datril's campaign but reducing its ownrevenues as well.Two years of back and forth in the United States between soybean andpalm oil producers about the deleterious effects on health of each other'sproducts did nothing but stop many people from buying all edible oils.",0.129424345496,0.441750841751,875 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 7, 1991, Monday, City Edition",321 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"BY JOANNE LIPMANWALL STREET JOURNALIF you think television commercials aren't as good as they used to be,you may be right. New U.S. research suggests that they are becoming lessmemorable, even as print advertising is holding relatively steady.A study by Video Storyboard Tests Inc., which tracks advertisingpopularity among consumers, found that the percentage of people who canname an outstanding TV campaign has plummeted over the past five years. In1986, 64 per cent of the people polled could, unaided, cite favouritecampaigns - a figure that plunged to just 48 per cent by last year. At thesame time, print advertising's memorability has hovered in the range of 26to 31 per cent.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, the most memorable print campaigns are the ones thathave lasted the longest and spent the most money on splashy multiple-pagespreads. Among them:Nike, Calvin Klein, Camel, Revlon and Absolut.Advertisers have written off print, but the numbers clearly show thatdollar for dollar, it is becoming a better value than TV advertising, saysDavid Vadehra, Video Storyboard's president. And it's becoming betterevery day: TV advertising's cost increases continue to far outpace thoseof print, despite TV's dwindling memorability, data from ad agency McCann-Erickson show.Ad executives say TV advertising in the United States is suffering asviewers zap ads, turn to video cassettes and are just plain overwhelmed bythe clutter of commercials on network, local and cable stations. At thesame time, TV ads are more frequently substituting glitz and fancyphotography for good ideas, they say.It's hard &quot;to find a really badly executed piece of TV advertising anymore, but it's very easy to find a lot of irrelevant, rotten ideas,&quot; saysMartin Purls, chief executive officer and president of ad agency Ammirati&amp; Purls, which created the Ultimate Driving Machine campaign for BMW.Print advertising, meanwhile, particularly in magazines, is gettingmore sophisticated as marketers learn to make better use of the lessexpensive medium. The most important lesson they've learned: consistency.A look at Video Storyboard's top 10 U.S. print campaigns for 1990 showsthat most are at least three years old and several have been running formore than a decade. There isn't a limited-run campaign in sight.Marlboro cigarettes, for one, has been a top-10 staple in the UnitedStates for years, thanks to the Marlboro Man cowboy: he was introduced byad agency Leo Burnett back in 1954. And Absolut vodka's award-winningcampaign took a full decade to make the grade. It made its debut in thetop-10 list at No. 5 this year, although the distinctive campaign usingartists' renditions of Absolut bottles and puns like &quot;Absolut perfection&quot;has been running since 1981. Guess jeans' black-and-white photographs ofsex kittens, and Camel's cartoon mascot, the butt-puffing Joe Camel, havealso become fixtures in magazines.Consistency and continuity - that's the &quot;secret for magazines if youwant to be visible,&quot; says Dick Costello, president and chief operatingofficer of Absolut's ad agency, TBWA. &quot;For us, that's the way to useprint. It's a slow-building medium.&quot; Video Storyboard's Mr. Vadehrabelieves that &quot;in print, consistency is even more important than in TV.&quot;Making a big impression in print, while often cheaper than TV, stillisn't for those with small pocketbooks. Most of the top-10 print campaignsused costly multipage ads, includingNike, Calvin Klein and Guess jeans.Special effects, such as the puzzle stamp and musical ads Absolut has run,can cost even more than TV advertising.Spending a lot of money in itself, though, is no guarantee that a printcampaign will break through. While the big auto makers are all major printadvertisers, only two of them, Infiniti at No. 6 and Ford at No. 9, madethe top 10. Infiniti stood out because of its controversial campaign usingzen-inspired nature scenes to introduce the car, Mr. Vadehra says. Fordmade the cut, he says, because its ads, unlike those of its competitors,use the same distinctive layout and logo to tout all its product lines.Print remains a tough sell, though. For clients and ad agencyexecutives alike, the glitz of TV is too alluring to ignore. Printadvertising, solid but so often unexciting, runs a distant second choice.Advertisers often &quot;feel the 'second team' (at an ad agency) works on printads. When I was on the agency side, everyone wanted to work on TV,&quot; saysBill Landgraf, director of media planning for Kraft General Foods, one ofthe largest advertisers in the United States.Ammirati &amp; Purls's Mr. Purls sees that phenomenon daily. Last year, heconsidered hiring a senior creative executive at a salary of more than$200,000. Then he asked to see the man's print work. &quot;He doesn't doprint,&quot; came the reply. &quot;There's an attitude,&quot; Mr. Purls says. He didn'thire the executive, and he says that the attitude problem helps explainwhy the quality of some print advertising &quot;is appalling. It's basic humannature and greed. They want to do TV.&quot;Magazines and newspapers are trying desperately to prove that print adscan be as effective as TV commercials, or even more so. Family Circle, apublication of the New York Times Co. Magazine Group, recently completed astudy of nearly 100,000 households in which it tracked purchases of 22brands advertised in the magazine over 28 weeks.

"BY JOHN BARBERSpecial to The Globe and Mail&quot;BOY, am I on a roll,&quot; exclaimed graphic designer Rick Valicenti, pausingin mid-tangent to comment on the weird and unexpected directions hisMonday evening lecture at Harbourfront was taking. &quot;And,&quot; he added, &quot;Ihave no way of knowing where I'm going.&quot;Mr. Valicenti, a speaker in Virtu's Centrifuge lecture series, had noidea where he was going because he had mounted the podium armed withlittle more than a collection of recent newspaper clippings and a promiseto &quot;try to catch a stream of consciousness.&quot; The stream he caught took himfrom the Buddha's sayings to the mystery of flea-market toothpick holders,from the winemaking skills of Francis Ford Coppola to the motives ofneighbours bearing casseroles. &quot;If you want me to speak specifically aboutgraphic design,&quot; he said, &quot;we can do that later.&quot;&nbsp;Mr. Valicenti's audience of young graphic designers wasn't in the leastdisappointed with the impish designer's &quot;Zen Rick&quot; shtick, however. He isa hero who could have lectured in Esperanto to a rapt audience. That isbecause at 39, Mr. Valicenti has accomplished something every one of themyearns to do: he has risen to the very top of his profession without theslightest compromise to his own highly original and personal style ofdesign.As the creative force behind the Chicago studio Thirst, Mr. Valicenticame to Toronto billed as one of America's &quot;cutting edge&quot; graphicdesigners. Certainly the slides he used to accompany his lecture, alongwith a recently self-published booklet of his work, substantiated thatclaim. Here there is little distinction between graphic and fine art: aportrait of rap star Vanilla Ice as a pimple-faced, dragon-tongued culturethief, several Cubist meditations on a gum wrapper, a dictionary shreddedmessily by a chainsaw.Sometimes Mr. Valicenti's images are accompanied by a jokey textwritten in the idiom of a vanity licence plate. Thus his studio, Thirst,becomes 3st; his booklet is THISRT and his motto, BEZ. His quirky use oftype combines a modernist's fascination with type's abstract shapes and achild's lofty indifference to all established conventions regarding itsuse.What Mr. Valicenti didn't show was much of his commercial work, whichon the evidence he provided is only slightly more conventional. Many ofhis clients (including Gilbert Paper, the contract furniture companySteelcase and Cooper Lighting) direct their advertising to designers andare therefore more willing to take risks. &quot;Their threshhold for pain ismuch higher than everyone else's,&quot; Mr. Valicenti jokes.But how can a man who was recently contracted by a Japanese candycompany to design a Valentine's Day series of chocolates - called RickValicenti's Gentle Manhattan Love - fail to become a star? Especially whenone of the bonbons is a pink-coloured chocolate screw with a heart-shapedhead?Many of the images Mr. Valicenti did choose, which included everythingfrom Soviet Constructivist El Lissitzky's business card to a detail fromMichelangelo's Pieta, revolved in a cryptic, Zen-like way around the issueof integrity. &quot;It's very easy to forget why you participate in aprofession,&quot; he told a questioner, &quot;because as soon as you areparticipating you encounter people who want to beat you up.&quot; Resistingthem is only half the battle. The goal, says Mr. Valicenti, is to&quot;transcend our real purpose, satisfy all our constraints and delight atthe same time.&quot;There's so much stuff that abuses humans in the name of greed, and weas graphic designers wrestle with that all the time. Are we mercenaries?Odds are we are. But on some level we have to draw the line and say, 'Hey,we can still sell your product to all those people who are 25 to 35 yearsold and white and go shopping with a grocery cart - we can still sell moreof it than the competition - but in doing that maybe we can also help bygiving them something of real value.&quot;It beats just making &quot;more fodder for the landfill.&quot; But it's still alimited ambition, and for the time being it plays to a limited audience.Mr. Valicenti knew he ran the risk of losing his audience when he foundedThirst in 1988, after working on a catalogue for French designer PhilippeStarck, and committed himself wholly to his own vision. In fact, most ofthe clients who loved the work of R. Valicenti Design couldn't stomachThirst. But the designer had started on the path that quickly carried himto the top echelon of his profession.Now, he dreams of carrying his uncompromised personal vision to themass market. &quot;I'm so anxious now for an opportunity to do something thathas a large audience,&quot; he says. For months, he daydreamed about doing atelevision campaign forNike. Then, last Thursday,Nikecalled and askedto see his portfolio. His delight in the call is mixed with dread. &quot;I havea feeling there's going to be so many account executives preceding everypresentation that my involvement with the client is just going to get lostin space,&quot; he says. &quot;But I hope I can extend my esthetic to speak to ahuge audience, and I hope it will have the same kind of integrity behindit.&quot; One thing is for sure: transposing the graphic insights of Zen Rickto the mass market won't BEZ.John Barber is a Toronto-based freelance writer.",0.159499244142,0.500352733686,869 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 23, 1991, Wednesday, City Edition",323 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"BY LESLIE C. SMITHLAST weekend, I asked my nephew, who is turning five, what he wanted forhis birthday. In an excited tone, Owen replied: &quot;You know what Daddy'sgetting me? Basketball shoes!&quot;It seems to start young, this predilection for athletic footwear. I canremember myself, close to Owen's age, watching with mouth agape anAmerican television ad for Keds sneakers. A group of bad guys was chasinga kid who, thanks to his rubber-soled Keds, leapt right over an eight-footchain-link fence and escaped.Gosh, I wanted those shoes. I believed in them, the same way I believedthat drinking whole milk and eating Wonder Bread would endow me withbulging biceps. When at last I got my own pair of Keds, I tried my best toleap over tall fences, but the magic was not there. I was left with vaguefeelings of inadequacy: Was I to blame, or was it the shoes?&nbsp;Today's running shoes - and the TV ads for them - are moresophisticated. Sports superstars, famous directors and multi-million-dollar specialty stores have turned the simple sneaker into an air-padded,lug-soled, Zorbathane-inserted, high-priced must-have for kids and adultsalike.Yet the message is the same. With a pair of high-topNikeAir Force180s strapped to your feet, you too can play basketball like MichaelJordan. If you can't, it's not the shoes' fault.So what if you don't even play basketball? The point is, these shoesare cool. Boy or man, you can flash the design logo and impress yourfriends. Forget the questions: Will these shoes be good for walking aroundin? Or will they end up damaging my arches? Questions are for sissies. Asthe ads say, Just Do It. Spend the $180 plus taxes. Buy yourself or yourchild a not-so-cheap thrill.You realize that just doing it in Detroit could cost you your life. Inmany American inner-cities, a good pair ofNikesis worth their weight inRolex watches. You might as well hang a sign around your neck that saysMug Me.You have to be careful, too, how you do up your shoelaces. In theUnited States, the way they're tied can indicate gang affiliation. Thecoolest of the cool often leave their laces completely undone, a stylederived from prison life where shoelaces are routinely removed to preventsuicide attempts. A neatly tied shoe, in contrast, is a sure sign ofnerdiness whether south of the border or in more moderate Canada.There are people who actually buy athletic shoes for use in sports.Spending over a hundred bucks for a pair might, to them, seem well worththe money. But as anyone who has recently visited a footwear store willtestify, buying only one pair of athletic shoes is not easy.You may solve some of your selection problems by purchasing cross-trainers, but chances are you won't find a pair that cover all yoursporting activities. What if you like tennis with a little weight-trainingon the side? Then you'll need two different pairs of shoes. For biking orhiking on weekends, another couple of pairs.The jogging shoe is a separate entity, as is the aerobics shoe. Andjust when you thought it was safe to go to the gym, along comes Reebokwith its brand new Step Aerobics shoe. That's right, a training shoe foruse solely in stepping up and down on a stair riser.I imagine that sooner rather than later, people will get fed up withthe surfeit of athletic shoes on the market. Already, the style punditsare predicting a return to the simple, blue-and-white striped AdidasGazelles that were so popular during the seventies. Me, I'm holding outfor the original Keds runner.

"Admission to advertising's biggest, and diciest, extravaganza, the&nbsp;Super Bowl, may have tripled in the past decade - from $ 275,000 to&nbsp;$ 800,000 for 30 seconds' worth of 100 million Americans' attention - but&nbsp;sponsors are still rushing to the game, checkbooks in hand.&quot;We're actually in pretty good shape,&quot; says Jake Keever, by way of&nbsp;understatement. Mr. Keever is executive vice president of sales at ABC,&nbsp;which is broadcasting the game Jan. 27. &quot;We have two spots unsold on the&nbsp;game, and four people are chasing them.&quot;ABC will fetch $ 45 million from the 56 30-second spots during the&nbsp;game, and another $ 9 million from the 2 1/2 hours of pregame and postgame&nbsp;shows, which the network is selling for prices ranging from $ 110,000 to&nbsp;$ 450,000 for 30 seconds. All but four of these spots are sold.&nbsp;The game was such a blowout last year (the San Francisco 49ers&nbsp;drubbed the Denver Broncos 55-10), viewers tuned out the second half and&nbsp;the game received the lowest rating in two decades. That's had a chilling&nbsp;effect.&quot;Our clients are going into the NFL playoffs, it's safer,&quot; says&nbsp;Larry Kapold, an executive vice president with Foote Cone &amp; Belding,&nbsp;whose clients include previous Super Bowl advertisers Mazda Motors of&nbsp;America and Levi Strauss &amp; Co.But for many advertisers - such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola - a&nbsp;chance to skewer a competitor or introduce a new product in front of the&nbsp;year's largest TV audience is a chance they can't afford to miss.Among this year's biggest Bowlers:Coca-Cola and Walt Disney World. They're co-sponsoring a 12-minute&nbsp;halftime show featuring New Kids on the Block. At the beginning of half,&nbsp;Atlanta-based Coca-Cola will air a special &quot;Crack the Code for Real&nbsp;Refreshment&quot; ad, enabling game-card holders (the company hopes to&nbsp;distribute 75 million cards before the game) to hold their cards up to&nbsp;the screen and become instant winners. The commercial emits a special&nbsp;signal that &quot;decodes&quot; the cards. Prizes range from coupons for Diet Coke&nbsp;to a single cash prize of $ 1 million.Pepsi-Cola, not to be outdone, says it will make millionaires of&nbsp;three viewers on game day through its Diet Pepsi &quot;You've Got the Right&nbsp;One Baby, Uh-Huh!&quot; call-in promotion. Viewers get game instructions in&nbsp;commercials aired before and during the game, then call a toll-free&nbsp;number. A recorded message by singer Ray Charles, who appears in the&nbsp;commercials, asks callers to sing the new Diet Pepsi theme song, and&nbsp;leave their name and address. Finalists will be chosen randomly, and the&nbsp;three $ 1 million winners will be announced in a post-game commercial.Athletic shoe rivalsNikeand L.A. Gear will go toe to toe. L.A.&nbsp;Gear hired the same creative team - now at a different agency - that&nbsp;created the famous &quot;1984&quot; Super Bowl spot for Apple Macintosh computers&nbsp;to create an ad to launch its new Catapult shoe. And the agency that&nbsp;created the &quot;Bo Knows&quot;Nikeads is producing the kickoff campaign for the&nbsp;NikeAir 180.Anheuser-Busch is taking its Bud Bowl into the third year, spending&nbsp;$ 6 million to air its farcical football games between bottles of beer.Panasonic is spending $ 4 million on six commercials to promote its&nbsp;corporate image and new products.Other advertisers slated to appear on the game include McDonald's,&nbsp;AT&amp;T, Federal Express, United Parcel Service, and Master Lock Co.; Safe harbor?Real estate is hardly recession-proof. The Fed's $ 2.3 billion&nbsp;bailout of The Bank of New England this week (largely because of bad real&nbsp;estate loans) is evidence enough of that.Still, in the throes of a recession, Atlanta's Austin Kelley&nbsp;Advertising this week began a print campaign in Florida newsppaers&nbsp;promoting Arvida Communities in Florida as a safe investment in a&nbsp;recession.One ad urges investors who are &quot;looking for signs of stability in&nbsp;the economy&quot; to look no further than Arvida. Another reads, &quot;When the&nbsp;future looks a little uncertain, it's time to review the lessons of the&nbsp;past.&quot; The ads explain that Arvida properties have &quot;weathered economic&nbsp;storms for 30 years . . . and have remained both a solid value and South&nbsp;Florida's most beautiful way of life.&quot;Compiled from staff, wire and published reports.",0.0180852644088,0.451468466174,704 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 28, 1991, Monday, City Edition",325 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Documents revealing how much Vince Dooley made as football coach and&nbsp;athletics director at Georgia in 1986 reveal how a coach's outside income&nbsp;can dwarf his salary.Of the $ 374,497.89 Dooley received that year, only $ 125,500 came&nbsp;from Georgia. The remaining $ 248,997.89 came from a shoe company, radio&nbsp;and television contracts, speaking engagements, and a football camp.&nbsp;Repeated attempts to contact Dooley by telephone were unsuccessful.According to documents obtained by The Journal-Constitution under an&nbsp;order by the Georgia Supreme Court, Dooley's salary for the year was&nbsp;$ 95,000. In addition, he received $ 4,500 in expenses, plus a $ 26,000&nbsp;premium paid on an annuity.He also had use of a luxury automobile and housing. The house in&nbsp;which Dooley resides was deeded to him by Georgia's athletics association&nbsp;several years ago.The documents show that Dooley received $ 152,341.77 for his weekly&nbsp;television shows during the 1986 football season, plus another $ 30,000&nbsp;for appearing on Georgia's football radio network shows, another $ 9,000&nbsp;for 11 tailgate shows and $ 6,000 for a weekly call-in show on WGST-AM.Additionally, the documents show Dooley received $ 30,000 from aNike&nbsp;shoe contract (not including $ 2,000 worth of merchandise, 300 pairs of&nbsp;shoes for his team, plus another 100 because the Bulldogs went to a bowl&nbsp;game, and $ 500 in merchandise for each of 12 assistants).Dooley resigned as head coach effective at the conclusion of&nbsp;Georgia's Gator Bowl victory over Michigan State on Jan. 1, 1989, but&nbsp;remains athletics director.The documents on Dooley's income originally were requested by The&nbsp;Journal-Constitution in 1987 under the state open records act. University&nbsp;president Charles Knapp agreed to release them, but Dooley, men's&nbsp;basketball coach Hugh Durham and women's basketball coach Andy Landers&nbsp;filed suit in Fulton County Superior Court in December 1987 to prevent&nbsp;release of the records.The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Nov. 29 last year that all but two&nbsp;of the documents in question were public domain.Another hearing is scheduled for Fulton County Superior Court Jan.&nbsp;28 before Judge Frank Hull in which requests for other Georgia documents&nbsp;plus similar files detailing athletic-related outside income of Georgia&nbsp;Tech coaches will be argued.",0.196428571429,0.439880952381,388 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"November 21, 1991, Thursday, City Edition",326 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Vince Dooley says his athletically related income - documented&nbsp;earlier this week at more than $ 374,000 in 1986 - explains why his wife&nbsp;didn't want him to quit coaching.&quot;That's exactly the reason Barbara didn't want me to give up&nbsp;coaching after 25 years,&quot; Dooley said. &quot;When we got to Georgia, my salary&nbsp;was $ 12,500. I got a $ 2,000 subsistence allowance and a $ 1,000 television&nbsp;package - $ 100 per game - for a grand total of $ 15,500. That's probably&nbsp;about what I was worth then.&nbsp;&quot;I finally reached a respectable salary in light of the job I was&nbsp;doing,&quot; Dooley said, &quot;and Barbara didn't want me to give up the greatest&nbsp;portion of it.&quot;Dooley retired as head coach after the 1988 season, but stayed on as&nbsp;athletics director.Documents made public by order of the Georgia Supreme Court indicate&nbsp;Dooley made $ 197,342 from radio and TV shows in 1986, $ 30,000 from a shoe&nbsp;contract withNike,$ 5,250 from his summer football camp and $ 2,406 for a&nbsp;cap endorsement - a total of $ 234,998, which he no longer receives.ROCKET MAN: Notre Dame football player Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail, who&nbsp;announced Thursday he will forgo his senior season in favor of the NFL,&nbsp;will be transformed into a corporation - &quot;Team Rocket&quot; - that is expected&nbsp;to convert his clean image into millions of dollars. Ismail already has&nbsp;assembled a team of negotiators, financial advisors and attorneys. It's&nbsp;been estimated he could gross $ 25 million almost immediately upon signing&nbsp;a pro football contract.GOING, GOING, GONE: The Atlanta Braves' &quot;Smiling Indian&quot; logo is&nbsp;quietly being phased out as an official symbol of the team. According to&nbsp;Steve Goff, merchandise manager of the Braves Clubhouse at CNN Center,&nbsp;the team will emphasize the tomahawk with either &quot;Atlanta&quot; or &quot;Braves&quot;&nbsp;written above it. However, in order to protect the trademark - and to&nbsp;satisfy some customers who specifically ask for the smiling Indian emblem&nbsp;on their merchandise - the Braves' catalog this year will feature one or&nbsp;two items with that logo.GUESTS OF HONOR: University of Georgia ticket manager Freddy Jones&nbsp;says the expansion of Sanford Stadium, raising capacity from 82,122 to&nbsp;86,357, will mean more end-zone seating for visiting fans and more&nbsp;sideline seating for Bulldogs fans. Construction in the lower level of&nbsp;the west end zone is under way and will be complete in time for the 1991&nbsp;season. Georgia has sold all of its 48,000 season tickets every year&nbsp;since 1980, but Jones doesn't expect to sell out this season - even with&nbsp;a home schedule that includes games against LSU, Clemson, Auburn and&nbsp;Kentucky - because of the addition of 4,235 extra seats.RINGER: A Georgia Tech players committee appointed to decide on the&nbsp;design of the Yellow Jackets' football national championship rings heard&nbsp;presentations from three companies this week - Herff Jones, Jostens and&nbsp;Balfour. According to assistant athletics director Jim Murphy, NCAA rules&nbsp;allow schools to purchase championship awards for players as long as the&nbsp;price is under $ 300. . . . Along with hot dogs, popcorn, soft drinks, T-&nbsp;shirts, pom-pons and bumper stickers, Tech students can purchase an MCI&nbsp;long-distance telephone calling card in the concourse of Alexander&nbsp;Memorial Coliseum.

"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The Atlanta Braves rewarded National League&nbsp;rookie of the year David Justice with a $ 195,000 raise Wednesday, signing&nbsp;the outfielder to a one-year contract worth $ 297,000.&nbsp;Justice's deal is the biggest in major-league history for a player&nbsp;entering his second season, according to his agent, Eric Goldschmidt.&quot;The most a player had gotten before, going into his second season,&nbsp;was Baltimore pitcher Gregg Olson,&quot; said Goldschmidt, a Los Angeles-&nbsp;based agent who also represents Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry.Olson, who won the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1989,&nbsp;made $ 270,000 last year.Justice, who made $ 102,000 in 1990, hit .282 with 29 home runs and&nbsp;81 RBIs. H e blossomed after the trade of Dale Murphy, replacing him in&nbsp;right field and hitting 11 home runs during a 16-game span in August.&quot;This just goes along with everything else that is happening in&nbsp;baseball as far as the pay scale,&quot; said Braves general manager John&nbsp;Schuerholz. &quot;But I'm not saying David doesn't deserve it, because he had&nbsp;a great season.&quot;Justice also has become marketable off the field. His marketing&nbsp;agent, Mike DeSola of PrimeTime Sports Marketing in New York, said&nbsp;Justice has made $ 100,000 from endorsements and autograph shows.&quot;He's the hottest sport commodity in Atlanta,&quot; said DeSola. &quot;He has&nbsp;a deal withNikeshoes and Easton batting gloves, and by the time he&nbsp;goes to spring training, we will have worked a glove deal with either&nbsp;Rawlings or Regent.&quot;With the signing of Justice, the Braves now have 11 players on their&nbsp;40-man roster not under contract: pitchers John Smoltz, Steve Avery, Tony&nbsp;Castillo, Kent Mercker and Paul Marak; catchers Greg Olson and Kelly&nbsp;Mann; infielders Jeff Blauser, Mark Lemke and Francisco Cabrera, and&nbsp;outfielder/first baseman Tommy Gregg",0.188636363636,0.337121212121,307 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"May 23, 1991 Thursday",330 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"ANiketennis shoe in the roadway recently was grim evidence of a&nbsp;tragic accident that killed a mother, a Brookwood High School senior and&nbsp;a former student.The teen driving one of the vehicles, a late-model Pontiac&nbsp;Bonneville SSE, was speeding up to 70 mph on a residential street when he&nbsp;lost control and crashed head-on into the woman's van, police said. The&nbsp;mother was heading to Brookwood to pick up her daughter.&quot;What caused that wreck is what I refer to as the testosterone&nbsp;level. The driver apparently couldn't resist using the power of his&nbsp;vehicle,&quot; George W. Black Jr., Gwinnett's director of transportation,&nbsp;said later.&nbsp;The Feb. 7 crash pushed the number of Brookwood classmates who have&nbsp;died in car wrecks in the last three years to 12.Once again, parents, teens and other members of the community were&nbsp;jolted into re-examining the problem of teen driving habits, something a&nbsp;community task force has been doing since September.The task force, composed of police, legislators, students, parents&nbsp;and teachers at Brookwood, has proposed more than 12 ideas for parents to&nbsp;help make their teens safer drivers.They concluded parents should not help teens buy fast cars, should&nbsp;boost teen awareness of driving safety and should not let teens drive&nbsp;after midnight.While the task force is committed to stemming the tide of teen&nbsp;driving deaths, many students seem fatalistic and unconvinced safety&nbsp;measures can help.When asked what could stop the carnage, one Brookwood junior said&nbsp;too many teens are unsafe drivers but she didn't think anything could be&nbsp;done about it.A senior noted all cars will go 70 mph or 80 mph - more than fast&nbsp;enough to kill someone.Another senior said his driver's education class didn't spend much&nbsp;time on safety.But school officials said safety is definitely a large portion of&nbsp;the course.&quot;What a student interprets as not being safety really might be&nbsp;safety,&quot; said Dan Chelko, Brookwood's community school director.Do you think it would help if teens were not allowed to drive high-&nbsp;performance cars?; Don't lay the blame on carI don't think you can blame the car unless it's an equipment&nbsp;malfunction. I think the drivers, they err in their judgment, and that's&nbsp;what causes the collision.I haven't seen a car yet that won't go fast enough to kill you. We&nbsp;have teenagers killed in VW Beetles and in Bonnevilles. The car doesn't&nbsp;have a whole lot to do with it. They're going to show off no matter what&nbsp;they are driving. Just like a buck deer when they're in rut, they'll kick&nbsp;up their heels, they'll drop their guard. That's how hunters manage to&nbsp;kill them. Same with a kid. They are not thinking, and that's what kills&nbsp;them.Traffic division supervisor, Gwinnett police; Help teens resist pressureNo. Such a prohibition should be part of a more comprehensive&nbsp;approach that includes helping teens and parents resist the social&nbsp;pressures that cause them to want such cars.Gwinnett school superintendent; Kids shouldn't have carsI don't think they should because they don't use good judgment.If I had a car when I was that age, I might not have been living&nbsp;today. Because I was wild too. And the best way to hold a kid back at&nbsp;that age until they mature more is to not allow them to have those cars,&nbsp;those machines.Former school board member; Driver's safety course firstIf they can afford to pay for them and pay for the insurance and the&nbsp;gas, yes, and after they have taken a driver's safety course.Hopkins Elementary School; Do what some colleges doI don't know. I think one way a solution could be reached would be&nbsp;the same way they do it in college. In the university system, students&nbsp;are not allowed to drive if they are freshmen. I feel like if a high&nbsp;school system would implement that, let them reach their junior and&nbsp;senior years, then they could drive any kind of vehicle as long as&nbsp;they've proved their responsibility.Gwinnett commissioner; Leave it up to teens, parentsI think that should be a parental and teen decision, not a&nbsp;legislative decision.I don't think it would change the accident rate. Responsible driver&nbsp;education and more parental control over the car would reduce the&nbsp;accident rate.I had a Mustang. My parents exercised extreme control. And I had no&nbsp;problem, no tickets, no accidents. Not only should teens be held&nbsp;responsible, parents should be responsible. And if they can't handle it,&nbsp;then teens should not be allowed to have the car.Former president, Gwinnett Association of Educators; These autos made to speedThat was one of the recommendations that we published that we&nbsp;discourage parents from helping young people buy high-performance cars.&nbsp;One of the reasons is there is a tendency with high-performance vehicles&nbsp;to drive fast because that is basically what the cars are made for, high&nbsp;speed. We are concerned in many instances that driver skills do not&nbsp;correspond with the power under the hood, that they can't control it.There is a lot of peer pressure. Parents, in order for their young&nbsp;persons to be popular, will just not use good common sense as far as&nbsp;parenting skills are concerned.Brookwood High School principal; Vehicles don't kill, drivers doI don't have a problem about that. My husband does. We are a very&nbsp;divided household. It was funny you're asking because we were talking&nbsp;about it last night, my son and I on one side and my husband on the other&nbsp;side of the fence. Basically, I feel like the person should have respect&nbsp;for whatever vehicle they're driving, whether it's a bicycle or Trans Am.&nbsp;You have to know your limitations and ability to control that vehicle. I&nbsp;don't see that the vehicle kills; it is the driver.13th District director, Georgia PTA; They are too dangerous'No. I feel they are too dangerous. I feel they are inexperienced to&nbsp;drive something that is high performance. I don't think they are&nbsp;responsible to be under control in all situations.Peachtree Elementary and Norcross High parent; At this age, there's no fearI don't believe that they should be. At this age they have no fear.&nbsp;I just don't think they are mature enough to handle a high-performance&nbsp;car. The reason they have so many of these high-performance cars is peer&nbsp;pressure, and I feel like the parents are responsible for giving in and&nbsp;allowing these children to have these cars.Norcross High School parent; Bad for safety, insuranceI think for their own safety it's not a good idea, especially&nbsp;beginning drivers because they need to get more experience in a less&nbsp;powerful car. I think for economic reasons it wouldn't be a wise decision&nbsp;for a teenager to own one of those cars because of the high insurance.Norcross High School parent",0.144076973255,0.490642530985,1126 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 1, 1991 Saturday",331 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"DAYTON, Ohio - Because of unwanted calls, Georgia Tech guard Kenny&nbsp;Anderson has changed his telephone number four times this season. Ohio&nbsp;State's Jim Jackson has gotten it every time.The only time Anderson hopes Jackson won't have his number is today&nbsp;at the University of Dayton Arena, when the Yellow Jackets (17-12) meet&nbsp;the Buckeyes (26-3) in the second round of the NCAA Midwest Regional&nbsp;(Channel 5, 12:20 p.m.).&nbsp;Anderson makes sure Jackson, the Buckeyes' leading scorer, has his&nbsp;phone number because the two are good friends. Still, the Ohio State&nbsp;forward has a score to settle with him dating to their high school days,&nbsp;when Anderson was at Archbishop Molloy in New York and Jackson was at&nbsp;Macomber in Toledo, Ohio.Their paths crossed at a tournament in Myrtle Beach, S.C., during&nbsp;their junior years. Anderson's team won by 20, though neither says he can&nbsp;remember the exact score.&quot;We met at aNikeinvitational camp at Princeton and I wanted to&nbsp;meet him because we came out rated the No. 1 and No. 2 players at the&nbsp;camp ,&quot; said Jackson, the No. 2. &quot;We found out we were going to play at&nbsp;Myrtle Beach. They beat us by 20, but the friendship continued.&quot;It was in full force Saturday, when they twice interrupted&nbsp;interviews with hordes of reporters to trade handshakes and their Dayton&nbsp;hotel phone numbers.&quot;We don't get into all that game stuff for Sunday, like I'm going&nbsp;to beat you,' &quot; Anderson said. &quot;Well, during the course of the game, I'll&nbsp;let him know. But I never thought it would come to this. Once I looked at&nbsp;the bracket and saw we were in their regional, I figured we probably will&nbsp;wind up playing each other.&quot;Their versions of the last time they met differ slightly. Said&nbsp;Anderson, &quot;He had 40 points and 20 rebounds, I had 40 points and two&nbsp;assists. It was really an exciting game, just battling it out.&quot;Said Jackson, &quot;I had 35 points, 20 rebounds and he had like 38. But&nbsp;this game Sunday is a little bit different. More's on the line right now.&nbsp;I want to win. If he scores 50 and we win, that's cool. If he scores 50&nbsp;and we lose, that's a different story.&quot;Tech's second-round game last year featured Anderson against another&nbsp;high-profile Jackson - Chris of LSU. As he did before that game, Anderson&nbsp;is shying away from the hype that today's contest will become a one-on-&nbsp;one affair.&quot;It's going to be Georgia Tech vs. Ohio State and I'm going to be&nbsp;ready for the challenge,&quot; Anderson said.",0.0777825448361,0.441755308184,410 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 24, 1991 Thursday",332 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"His spectacular stardom as a major league outfielder and a National&nbsp;Football League running back defied the sportswriters, the color&nbsp;commentators and other assorted wags who said it couldn't be done. But&nbsp;now the conventional wisdom has apparently caught up with Bo Jackson.&nbsp;In an announcement as sudden and stunning as one of his mammoth home&nbsp;runs or 90-yard touchdowns, the Kansas City Royals baseball team said it&nbsp;was releasing Jackson because of a devastating hip injury he suffered&nbsp;playing football. His career with the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders may also&nbsp;be over.Jackson vows to come back, and perhaps he will be able to do the&nbsp;unexpected again. But the man whose seemingly invincible athletic prowess&nbsp;was summed up by theNikeTV commercial's phrase &quot;Bo knows&quot; now seems&nbsp;destined to be another of those American stars whose careers, like&nbsp;comets, blaze brightly before dying out all too soon.Bo Jackson had a $ 2,375,000 salary with the Royals. Because of his&nbsp;injury, the club is offering him to any team for $ 1.

"Bo Jackson has moved into the category of damaged goods, and his hip&nbsp;injury could cost the football/baseball all-star $ 100 million or more in&nbsp;long-term salary and endorsement revenue if he is unable to continue his&nbsp;professional career.That's the opinion of Bob Hope, a former Atlanta Braves executive&nbsp;who now is executive vice president of the Burson-Marsteller public&nbsp;relations firm in New York.Jackson's biggest loss of income would be from hisNikeshoe/apparel&nbsp;contract, currently estimated at $ 2.8 million per year. His total&nbsp;endorsement income this year is estimated at $ 4 million.Nikehas said it&nbsp;would not cancel its current contract with Jackson, but the company can&nbsp;drop him when the deal expires after 1993.&nbsp;Because he was waived by the Kansas City Royals, Jackson will draw&nbsp;only one-sixth of his $ 2.375 million salary this year, but he will get&nbsp;his full $ 1.6 million salary from the L.A. Raiders since NFL teams are&nbsp;prohibited from waiving players hurt while playing football.Were Jackson, 28, able to play 10 more seasons, his income likely&nbsp;would have totaled more than $ 100 million, according to Hope.Even if Jackson is able to play baseball later this season, watch&nbsp;forNiketo back off gradually and introduce a replacement, such as&nbsp;former Notre Dame wide receiver Rocket Ismail.MEMPHIS MONEY: Just because Federal Express owner Fred Smith has&nbsp;withdrawn from the ownership picture in the Memphis bid for an NFL&nbsp;franchise doesn't mean the city has abandoned its effort. Smith, alarmed&nbsp;that no one had taken the lead in generating community support necessary&nbsp;for a city to land a franchise, decided to do it himself. That leaves two&nbsp;promising ownership candidates: Billy Donovant, owner of a cotton&nbsp;brokerage firm that does $ 1.2 billion of business annually, and Wall&nbsp;Street commodities broker Paul Tudor Jones, famous for making $ 37 million&nbsp;in one day after the 1989 stock market crash. . . .

It's a circle-the-wagon response to what should&nbsp;be a wide-open examination of how media affect the real world.&nbsp;It's akin to saying that &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; had nothing to do with&nbsp;the Civil War or that William Randolph Hearst's reward of $ 50,000 to&nbsp;anyone proving the Spanish blew up the USS Maine wasn't a cause of the&nbsp;Spanish-American War.Viewers simply cannot help but be &quot;rippled&quot; by the emotional, gut-&nbsp;wrenching influence of huge moving color images backed by Dolby stereo&nbsp;sound.The riots accompanying &quot;New Jack City&quot; this year, or &quot;The Warriors&quot;&nbsp;five years ago, or even John Hinckley's rationale for shooting former&nbsp;President Reagan are the most disturbing examples.; Teaspoons' sell productsThose are, of course, dismissible as the actions of the maladjusted&nbsp;and the mentally ill - not mainstream America. But mainstream America is&nbsp;influenced, as well, by what we see - witness the thousands of young men&nbsp;and women who flocked to Navy recruiting stations after viewing &quot;Top&nbsp;Gun.&quot;Film's influence is most easily verified today by the fact that a&nbsp;Hollywood company exists to analyze scripts scene-by-scene to determine&nbsp;where and howNike,Budweiser, Toyota, Pepsi and Kellog's products can&nbsp;best be plugged into feature films.Does Mr. Levinson truly believe these films and the other&nbsp;multinationals purchasing American Film Promotion's services are throwing&nbsp;massive dollars after &quot;teaspoons?&quot;; Images shape opinionsPerhaps the director means that the films we see rarely destroy&nbsp;basic opinions or terminate lifelong value systems. In most cases, that's&nbsp;probably true.But when the attempt is made to alter public opinion, filmmakers can&nbsp;be amazingly effective. If not, why did American audiences find&nbsp;themselves cheering German sailors in the subtitled version of &quot;Das&nbsp;Boot,&quot; or the Viet Cong in 1989's &quot;Iron Triangle?&quot;Visual imagery can be brilliantly effective in reinforcing&nbsp;established ideas or in shaping opinions where none exists, often with&nbsp;unintended consequences.Shot after shot of missing children at the close of the television&nbsp;movie &quot;Adam,&quot; for example, sent the nation into mass hysteria a few years&nbsp;ago, replete with milk cartons, missing posters, child finger-printings&nbsp;and &quot;don't ever talk to anyone&quot; lectures.Parents all, very rationally, wanted to make certain their children&nbsp;were not among the 50,000 the movie told us disappeared every year.The reactions were logical responses to an intensely emotional film.&nbsp;Even after the news media discovered that 48,500 of those kids were&nbsp;either proven runaways or were taken by the other parent in a divorce,&nbsp;the hysteria continues with milk cartons and ad fliers.; Living on the mean streetsMovies and television programs like this give us what one critic&nbsp;calls the &quot;Mean World Syndrome.&quot; We are so sure that everyone out there&nbsp;is trying to rape, kill, hurt, con and rob us that we draw ourselves into&nbsp;individual cocoons, afraid of life. We buy extra locks, bulletproof book&nbsp;bags for our children, alarm systems for our boats, Mace packages for our&nbsp;cars, and guns, guns and more guns.Until the Mean World Syndrome becomes the ultimate - and deadly -&nbsp;Catch 22.Perhaps one or more of the police officers in Los Angeles with the&nbsp;all-too-ready nightsticks have what police call The Wyatt Earp Syndrome -&nbsp;a feeling that the cop's job is to save the world, even if it requires&nbsp;excessive violence.No Los Angeles cop, obviously, has met Wyatt Earp. But they have met&nbsp;his counterpart in countless Friday nights at the theater and Tuesday&nbsp;nights in their living room. People around &quot;Dirty Harry,&quot; remember, have&nbsp;a &quot;nasty habit of getting killed.&quot;; Power to influence valuesAmerica is just now beginning to grope with the issue of media&nbsp;influence. That's what the boycott of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot;&nbsp;the trials of 2 Live Crew and Judas Priest, the Parents' Music Resource&nbsp;Center and congressional mandates concerning commercial minutes on&nbsp;children's television are all about. It's why there has been such an&nbsp;uproar over Andrew Dice Clay and Public Enemy, over sex and violence,&nbsp;over blatant commercialism.To state it bluntly: If Hollywood, if the networks, if the record&nbsp;companies won't acknowledge their power to shape values, then Americans&nbsp;are more than willing to take power from them, to alter or bypass the&nbsp;First Amendment.Although the Constitution's decree that Congress shall make no&nbsp;law&quot; sounds absolute, the fact is that Congress, legislatures and the&nbsp;courts have routinely qualified freedom of speech. Examples abound from&nbsp;copyright and libel to recent obscenity rulings.Today, when anti-media public opinion is at a fever pitch, society&nbsp;appears poised to attack again. To prevent it, the film industry and the&nbsp;media in general must quit pretending they create only teaspoons.Each of those teaspoons, society feels, like the 27 men who died&nbsp;playing Russian roulette after viewing &quot;The Deer Hunter,&quot; are ripples in&nbsp;a tidal wave.",0.0612996851633,0.458272005772,919 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 17, 1991, Sunday",341 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Many Gwinnett schools have decided not to wait until 1996 for the&nbsp;Olympics. Students are already experiencing the intense competition and&nbsp;international flavor of the Games.Traditional springtime field day activities have been expanded into&nbsp;weeks of researching the customs and culture of foreign countries.&nbsp;Classes then compete as particular nations.&nbsp;&quot;Some of the kids didn't know about other countries until they did&nbsp;this,&quot; said Marcia Nolan, a physical education teacher at Lilburn Middle&nbsp;School.The school's Olympic Games included South Korea, Canada, Norway,&nbsp;Mexico and Italy. Students from the sixth through eighth grades were&nbsp;brought together to make up a country. &quot;We tried to pull the school&nbsp;together,&quot; Ms. Nolan said.Before the athletic events - such as the 440-yard relay, an obstacle&nbsp;course and a tug of war - the students made their countries' flags and&nbsp;some even painted their faces and arms with the colors of their&nbsp;countries.&quot;It really feels like you're in the Olympics,&quot; said 12-year-old Nhan&nbsp;Huynh, a Lilburn Middle student.&quot;You learn good sportsmanship.&quot;While the concept of holding a school Olympics is not new, the fact&nbsp;that the Games will be coming to Atlanta in five years has added fuel to&nbsp;the Olympic fire and given teachers a new method of building student&nbsp;enthusiasm about history, geography, politics and even physical&nbsp;education.Having a schoolwide Olympics is one example of how the county is&nbsp;moving toward an &quot;interdisciplinary curriculum,&quot; said Glen Blankenship,&nbsp;social studies coordinator for Gwinnett public schools.&quot;Anything we can do that makes students see how subjects are related&nbsp;makes learning that much more real and that much more effective,&quot; Dr.&nbsp;Blankenship said, adding that studying the Olympics &quot;gives students a&nbsp;better appreciation for other cultures.&quot;Jesse Racine, a seventh-grader at Lilburn Middle School, said he&nbsp;enjoyed learning about his team's country, South Korea.&quot;We had to do research on the conflicts and the wars they've had,&quot;&nbsp;Jesse said, adding that during the course of his study he also discovered&nbsp;thatNikeshoes and a wide range of electronic devices are made in South&nbsp;Korea. &quot;I think it's a cool country.&quot;Junior Spain, a physical education teacher at Dacula Middle School,&nbsp;which held its first Olympics last year, said he felt his school helped&nbsp;bring the 1996 Games to Atlanta.&quot;It made a good impression on the Olympic committee,&quot; Mr. Spain&nbsp;said. &quot;It gave us an idea that we were doing a little part in being able&nbsp;to sway the committee to pick Atlanta.&quot;The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) is hoping to get&nbsp;students excited about the Olympics &quot;so they can be good hosts when our&nbsp;guests come in 1996,&quot; said Sandy Jernigan, co-coordinator of the Olympic&nbsp;Day in the School program, which is primarily geared toward middle&nbsp;schools.Four hundred of the 600 middle schools in Georgia now participate in&nbsp;the program, including all of Gwinnett's middle schools.A program for the state's elementary and high schools will be&nbsp;developed over the next few years, Ms. Jernigan said.Buford Elementary, however, already has the Olympic vision. Their&nbsp;program began April 17 and ran for a month. Throughout the last four&nbsp;weeks, the pupils have studied their countries and competed in athletic&nbsp;events in their physical education classes.Margaret Hanson, a physical education teacher, began holding an&nbsp;Olympics four years ago, but this was the first year the athletics&nbsp;competition was combined with the school's social studies fair.The project culminated last Friday with an international festival.&nbsp;With passports in hand, pupils traveled to different classrooms disguised&nbsp;as foreign countries.The pupils' transworld experiences included mummifying a doll in&nbsp;Egypt, making maracas in Mexico, eating chocolate and cheese in&nbsp;Switzerland and playing golf in Puerto Rico.&quot;People are all the same,&quot; first-grade teacher Gail Cary told a&nbsp;class of pupils dressed in authentic Saudi Arabian garb. Ms. Cary's&nbsp;country was Botswana. &quot;It's your culture that's different where you grow&nbsp;up.&quot;",0.135440038685,0.346890485401,688 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 19, 1991, Tuesday",342 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"WILMINGTON, N.C. - This is his road, though the signs aren't up yet,&nbsp;the ones that will announce that this seven-mile stretch of salt air and&nbsp;interstate is Michael Jordan Road.Talk about open court. Nothing but a smattering of road signs dot&nbsp;Michael's bit of Interstate 40, assuring pilgrims to his hometown that&nbsp;the Azalea Optimists and Cascade Realty are taking care of litter. And&nbsp;that Barstow, Calif., is 2,554 miles due west.&nbsp;And how about that Michael Jordan exhibit at the New Hanover County&nbsp;Museum? Do you know, do you know, do you know?&quot;Well that's misinformation that has caused us some problems&nbsp;recently,&quot; museum director Janet K. Seapker says.Let curator Barbara Rowe clear this up:&quot;We have Michael's Olympic uniform and we borrowed his gold medal&nbsp;from his mother. And for a couple of years it was part of the Superstars&nbsp;of The Lower Cape Fear' exhibit. People loved it. We'll do it again.&quot;You mean Michael shared the exhibit with former Harlem Globetrotter&nbsp;Meadowlark Lemon, Sammy Davis Sr. and country singer Charlie Daniels?&quot;And there's an actor in Atlanta from here, not very big, I think&nbsp;he's in the Senate or something,&quot; Ms. Rowe says. &quot;Yeah, U.S. Rep.  Ben&nbsp;Jones. Cooter. We've got the jeans, cap and the sleeveless shirt he wore&nbsp;on The Dukes of Hazzard.' That's really neat. He came here and opened&nbsp;the exhibit.&quot;Oh, well. There are still some in this quiet, coastal community of&nbsp;45,000 who say the Chicago Bulls superstar is their most favorite of&nbsp;sons.And if state and city fathers have yet to master the marketing&nbsp;acumen to make Michael Jordan as synonymous with Wilmington asNikehas&nbsp;done with him and their athletic shoes, one place remains as mythical as&nbsp;Michael Jordan's basketball talents - Laney High School.Namely, the scuffed hardwood in the crackerbox gymnasium, where a&nbsp;skinny teenager would practice alone at 7 a.m. before classes began. Then&nbsp;at night, he would dazzle the college scouts and basketball crazies,&nbsp;crammed to the rafters, with heretofore unseen acrobatics.Nearly every day, visitors ask to see the gymnasium. They glimpse&nbsp;Michael's gold and blue high school jersey in the glass case in the foyer&nbsp;- the familiar No. 23 emblazoned below BUCS, the team's nickname. They&nbsp;see his name engraved on a plaque honoring the Buccaneers' 1980-81&nbsp;championship team.And if they're lucky enough to run into basketball coach Fred Lynch,&nbsp;they ask how was it Michael Jordan failed to make the varsity team as a&nbsp;10th-grader. How, Coach, did arguably today's greatest player - a member&nbsp;of the University of North Carolina's 1982 NCAA championship team, a 1984&nbsp;Olympic gold medal winner and the leader of a team seeking the 1991 NBA&nbsp;title - get cut?Mr. Lynch, then an assistant coach, has answered that question&nbsp;often. How there was only room for one 10th-grader on the varsity. How&nbsp;Leroy Smith, a 6-foot, 7-inch post player, was kept over a then 5-foot,&nbsp;10-inch Michael Jordan. How Michael never showed his disappointment at&nbsp;playing junior varsity.By the time he was a 6-foot, 4-inch senior, he was All-Everything.&nbsp;Prep All-American in basketball. Top baseball pitcher. High jump&nbsp;champion. One of the nicest and most popular students ever at Laney.&quot;He showed that other people can make it if they try. That no one&nbsp;needs to act like they're special,&quot; says Jason Whitfield, graduating&nbsp;senior and basketball guard, who has heard this sports lore as gospel&nbsp;from his coach.So until the North Carolina Board of Transportation mounts the first&nbsp;sign near the Cape Fear River (possibly this summer at a ceremony&nbsp;attended by Michael), or until the memorabilia of Sammy Sr., Meadowlark&nbsp;and Cooter are retrieved from mothballs, the most authentic tribute to a&nbsp;native son remains a small gymnasium.",0.159756155303,0.527780266608,633 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"March 23, 1991, Saturday",344 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"The alleged rape at the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Fla., has&nbsp;caught the public's attention, and Time uses it as a hook in its June 3&nbsp;edition to examine the issue of date rape.Writer Nancy Gibbs points out that deciding exactly what is rape is&nbsp;hard to determine in a society where some colleges define acquaintance&nbsp;rape as a spectrum &quot;ranging from crimes legally defined as rape to verbal&nbsp;harassment and inappropriate innuendo.&quot;She notes that women call it a hidden crime, while some men blame it&nbsp;on women &quot;who live to tease.&quot;&nbsp;The seven-page report includes interviews with women and also with&nbsp;men who feel unjustly accused. And a poll of 500 U.S. adults taken by&nbsp;Time and CNN shows the differences on the issue. Among the results: 54&nbsp;percent of the women and 69 percent of the men say that some women like&nbsp;to be talked into having sex.WOMEN AND MEDICINE I: Another sort of abuse of women is examined in&nbsp;the June issue of Ms. In &quot;Women as Wombs,&quot; Janice G. Raymond, professor&nbsp;of women's studies and medical ethics at the University of Massachusetts,&nbsp;questions the success of in vitro fertilization clinics. She says&nbsp;research has shown 90 percent to 95 percent of women who undergo IVF&nbsp;never take home babies. That finding is part of a wide-ranging report on&nbsp;the new reproductive technology.WOMEN AND MEDICINE II: In the June 3 issue of People, actor Gene&nbsp;Wilder talks about wife Gilda Radner's losing battle with ovarian cancer&nbsp;and how doctors could have caught it sooner.FACING UP TO PLASTIC SURGERY: Anyone considering a facelift or other&nbsp;plastic surgery may want to check out the June issue of Self. The piece,&nbsp;about top plastic surgeons, includes photos of a facelift in progress&nbsp;that are not for the squeamish.GUYS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN: The June issue of GQ takes a look at a&nbsp;male institution in &quot;The Last Hurrah: Can the bachelor party survive&nbsp;feminism, premarital sex, AIDS and couch dancing? Should it?&quot; Writer&nbsp;Stephen Fried pulls together anecdotes of parties ranging from the tame&nbsp;to the raunchy. He also includes a rating scale to help guys determine&nbsp;how much trouble various last flings might cause.SPIKE UP TO BAT: The cover photo on the May 27 issue of Sports&nbsp;Illustrated has some heavy hitters - Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris&nbsp;smiling broadly for a piece on the 1961 Yankees - but the real slugger&nbsp;isn't even promoted. Inside is a 10-page interview with filmmaker Spike&nbsp;Lee on topics ranging from being a superfan to hisNikecommercials to&nbsp;why he's such an angry young man. The search for what drives Mr. Lee goes&nbsp;back to his roots in Atlanta, Alabama and Brooklyn. Mr. Lee takes a jab&nbsp;at Deion Sanders, calling him &quot;another young brother who got some money&nbsp;and will have it spent before he knows he had it.&quot; The article is&nbsp;cleverly illustrated with photos of Mr. Lee in various baseball uniforms,&nbsp;including the Atlanta Braves.AROUND THE SOUTH: The June issue of Atlanta magazine looks at the&nbsp;fall from grace of Emory University law school's Abe Ordover, who was&nbsp;accused of sexual misconduct. . . .

"Cover charges at Atlanta-area sports bars for the Mike Tyson-Razor&nbsp;Ruddock heavyweight fight June 28 are likely to cost about $ 30 and would&nbsp;soar to between $ 40 and $ 45 for an Evander Holyfield-Tyson championship&nbsp;bout.That's the prediction of Atlanta attorney Bobby Ronick, who&nbsp;represents local pay-per-view TV marketing company Worldwide Satellites&nbsp;Ltd.Covers at local sports bars for last month's Holyfield-George&nbsp;Foreman championship match ranged from $ 10 to $ 35, but the norm was $ 20.&nbsp;Most bars were at capacity, and that kind of demand will only push&nbsp;prices higher.The in-home pay-per-view fees for Holyfield-Foreman ranged from a&nbsp;norm of $ 35.95 to $ 70, and those prices also are expected to be higher&nbsp;for Tyson-Ruddock or a Tyson-Holyfield matchup.LOTTERY PLAN CUT: Faced with opposition from its senate's powerful&nbsp;majority leader, New York state has sacked a lottery proposal that would&nbsp;have been based on the NFL scores of Giants, Bills and Jets games.The lottery would have operated much like many office football&nbsp;pools. Participants would have selected one of 100 squares that are&nbsp;randomly assigned two numbers from one to 10. Those whose two numbers&nbsp;matched the final digits of the score would win.The NFL strongly opposes state lotteries linked to its games.

With a&nbsp;25.6 points-per-game average with the Spurs and a mathematics degree from&nbsp;the Naval Academy, Robinson remains a lieutenant and civil engineer in&nbsp;the Navy Reserve and is an accomplished pianist - in short, the clean-cut&nbsp;role model corporations are finding more and more difficult to locate.&nbsp;Robinson already is in the fourth year of a $ 1 million endorsement&nbsp;contract withNike, and signed deals with Casio watches and Franklin&nbsp;Sports Industries while serving a two-year stint in the Navy after&nbsp;graduation.

"The Action Awards Breakers have picked up where they left off last&nbsp;season. Hitting a robust .600, the Snellville-based men's softball team&nbsp;has qualified for one national, one divisional and three state&nbsp;tournaments.Last season's U.S. Slo-pitch Softball Association (USSSA) state&nbsp;Class C Team of the Year is 47-16 overall and is in the driver's seat to&nbsp;win the highly regarded Amateur Softball Association (ASA) state Bud&nbsp;Light Triple Crown series, which continues this weekend in Fort Valley,&nbsp;Ga. They won the first leg of the series three weeks ago.&nbsp;The series awards points based on a team's finish in three&nbsp;designated tournaments, with the points leader being declared the state&nbsp;champion. The champion also gets its room and board paid for in the&nbsp;national tournament later this summer in Steamboat Springs, Colo. The&nbsp;Breakers qualified for that tournament with the win three weeks ago.&quot;It's a pretty prestigious thing there in Colorado,&quot; coach Ric&nbsp;Jarvis said. &quot;If we win the Triple Crown , we're probably talking a&nbsp;couple thousand dollars.&quot;The Breakers' success in the ASA series is just part of the team's&nbsp;fast start. They've already earned berths for this summer's ASA, USSSA&nbsp;and National Softball Association (NSA) state tournaments, as well as for&nbsp;the USSSA Southeast Divisional. They've finished second in two highly&nbsp;competitive tournaments - theNikeEarly Bird Tournament in Marietta and&nbsp;a USSSA divisional qualifier in Cartersville.&quot;We've been hitting the ball well, and our defense has been&nbsp;exceptional,&quot; said Jarvis, an original member of the team that was formed&nbsp;10 years ago to play in a recreation league.The Breakers have done most of their damage by coming through the&nbsp;loser's bracket of recent tournaments. In the first Triple Crown event,&nbsp;for instance, they lost their opening game, then won the next nine to&nbsp;take the championship.&quot;We've had to come back a number of times. That says a lot about our&nbsp;team right there,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;We've played in more games that a lot of&nbsp;other teams because we've had to come through the loser's bracket so many&nbsp;times.&quot;The success is not new. Since becoming the Breakers in 1981, the&nbsp;team has gained statewide respect. Last year, four players - including&nbsp;Player of the Year Mike Jordan, Derrick Davis, Ron Ammnons and Roger&nbsp;Bailey - were named to the USSSA All-State team as the Breakers set a&nbsp;state record in Class C for points won in tournament play. By winning the&nbsp;state title, the Breakers moved up to play in USSSA's B classification&nbsp;this year.&quot;We're consistently one of the better teams in the state. People&nbsp;hate playing us,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;Through the years, we've really grown&nbsp;into a good team.

"Georgia basketball coach Hugh Durham and football coach Ray Goff&nbsp;never covered this much real estate on a recruiting trip.How about this for a golf fantasy?

In fact, they even stopped for lunch&nbsp;and accomplished it all in just over 11 hours.&quot;We could have played another 18,&quot; Durham said. &quot;We still had two&nbsp;hours of light left, but we couldn't find another course.&quot;&nbsp;The golf-a-thon started at 8 a.m. Monday at Athens Country Club,&nbsp;which Durham and Goff played in one hour, 45 minutes, with each man&nbsp;riding his own cart.

Playing their final course in just over two hours, Durham and&nbsp;Goff completed the 72 holes at 7:05 p.m.Neither player wished to reveal the final scores, lest somebody&nbsp;remember them when filling out foursomes for all those handicap&nbsp;tournaments to which they regularly are invited, but Durham was the&nbsp;apparent winner.&quot;We both played pretty good,&quot; said Goff, &quot;but I don't think I saw&nbsp;Hugh miss two or three fairways all day.

"INGLEWOOD, Calif. - L.A., a city of 3.5 million, is either too&nbsp;sophisticated or too vain to ever admit being in a state of shock. Siege,&nbsp;maybe. Not shock.Shock is empty freeways. Clipper victories. Surfboard shortages.&nbsp;Thirty consecutive days of cloud cover and no rain. And no sun, either.&nbsp;But what happened inside the fabled Forum on Wednesday was, at the&nbsp;very least, an aftershock. The Chicago Bulls won the title . . . The&nbsp;Chicago Bulls won the title . . . The Chicago Bulls won the title . . .&nbsp;The Chicago Bulls won the title.Four games. Four victories. Three wins in the Forum, and just like&nbsp;that - it was that easy - Michael Jordan no longer is the lonely Bull. No&nbsp;longer the lonely superstar. Now, he has plenty of friends.Bird. Magic. Isiah. With this ring, he becomes wedded to Magic&nbsp;Johnson and Larry Bird, who formed an elite club back in the 1980s. Non-&nbsp;champions need not apply. Isiah Thomas finally broke down the door.&nbsp;Pounded on it twice, in fact. Now, Jordan.How good does it feel? Jordan cried. He was so overcome that he hid&nbsp;from NBC. &quot;Where's Jordan, where's Jordan?&quot; a frantic Bob Costas yelled,&nbsp;as he looked around the champagne-drenched locker room.Others came and went. The Rev. Jesse Jackson. Spike Lee. Ernie&nbsp;Banks. Johnny Kerr. Lakers GM Jerry West and assistant GM Mitch Kupchak.&nbsp;&quot;Too crowded,&quot; West said, ending his search for Jordan.Still, no Michael. But somewhere, by now, he was surely smiling. He&nbsp;had guided the Bulls to their first-ever championship in 25 years. A&nbsp;party in Chicago awaits.L.A.? L.A. can mourn, can shake, can complain that it wasn't fair&nbsp;because James Worthy and Byron Scott were hurt and Magic Johnson too old&nbsp;and Elden Campbell too young, but it was eminently fair, and right, and&nbsp;America celebrates because the Good Guy doesn't always finish last.This time the Good Guy won. Jordan ate his Wheaties and did all the&nbsp;right things, and when the time came, he came through. Blocked shots,&nbsp;steals, jumpers, passes, breakaway dunks, scoop shots, Michael being&nbsp;Michael.For six years, he wondered if it was meant to be. Six long years. As&nbsp;a rookie, he was snubbed in the All-Star Game by some of the (Isiah)&nbsp;Thomas Gang for arriving in aNikesweatsuit. His second year, he broke&nbsp;his foot and feuded with GM Jerry Krause because - get this - Jordan&nbsp;regained his health and wanted to finish out the season.Krause said no.Jordan said yes.Guess who won that battle?Jordan would win others, as well, including a race for MVP honors&nbsp;with his good friend Johnson. But that was nothing. Nothing like this.Jordan and his teammates arrived at the Forum two hours before game&nbsp;time, eager to learn the condition of Worthy (ankle) and Scott&nbsp;(shoulder).Worthy arrived soon after in street clothes, and remained in street&nbsp;clothes. Scott changed into his jersey and went out to the court to test&nbsp;the shoulder.Some of the Laker faithful - and some non-partisans - suggested that&nbsp;L.A. had a better chance without Scott, who shot 27 percent in the first&nbsp;four games. Consider this exchange during the interview session on Monday&nbsp;at Inglewood High.Horde of media jackals: &quot;How is your shoulder?&quot;Scott: &quot;Not good. I can't lift my arm. I can't shoot.&quot;Horde of media jackals: &quot;Ha, ha, ha.&quot;Or, as Vlade Divac might say, &quot;He make joke.&quot;But this was no joke. Scott slowly walked off the court. No go. No&nbsp;Worthy. No Scott. No chance? The Bulls hoped not. During the two days&nbsp;between games, they were determined to retain their edge.They resisted the lure of Hollywood, with Jordan even declining an&nbsp;invitation to appear on The Arsenio Hall Show, refused to become&nbsp;overconfident because of the injuries to Worthy and Scott, and the&nbsp;wounded ego of Magic, who dropped the Big One right here in the middle of&nbsp;the Forum on Tuesday. He might return for another season. He might not.Jordan empathized, but refused to become distracted.But would they win?They win. When it is finally, mercifully over, Jordan bolts for his&nbsp;coach, Phil Jackson, and engages Paxson, the hero, in the longest of&nbsp;embraces.As he enters the tunnel area, he is in tears. &quot;I've never been this&nbsp;emotional in public before,&quot; he says, &quot;but this is a great time to be&nbsp;emotional.&quot;",0.281558061821,0.584189640769,712 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"May 19, 1991, Sunday",350 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"MEMPHIS - The word drops softly in a rich baritone, a towering&nbsp;double-breasted figure letting it go: Memphis. Willie Herenton tries to&nbsp;sell his mayoral candidacy with verse.&quot;We must build coalitions that cut across race and class. I grow&nbsp;weary. . . . We have an opportunity to send a message to the nation that&nbsp;Memphis,&quot; he says slowly, his opponent two feet away, &quot;a city&nbsp;historically plagued by racial polarization, has made a sudden leap&nbsp;forward. Memphis . . .&quot;&nbsp;The cadence evokes the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and is aimed&nbsp;beyond these 700 Rotarians, most of them white, gathered at The Peabody&nbsp;Hotel. It's aimed at the television cameras. The 6-foot-6 former Memphis&nbsp;school superintendent wants to be the first black mayor of this&nbsp;predominantly black city on the Mississippi.Voters will decide today whether he unseats popular incumbent Dick&nbsp;Hackett, who offers the flip side of the New South coin: economic&nbsp;development.Mr. Hackett, a 42-year-old business guru without a college degree,&nbsp;as a career politician has managed to transform Memphis into an&nbsp;attractive trading post. Eighty-five businesses, including such titans as&nbsp;Federal Express, International Paper andNike,have expanded or relocated&nbsp;here in the past year.Mr. Herenton, 51, grew up in a housing project 15 blocks from what&nbsp;is now a glimmering downtown. The same determination that made him a&nbsp;Golden Gloves boxing champion earned him a doctorate and made him the&nbsp;first black school superintendent.It was a post he held with distinction from 1978 until June. Only&nbsp;once was he tempted to leave. In 1987, the Atlanta school board offered&nbsp;him its top job. He accepted, only to withdraw weeks later, after an&nbsp;impassioned plea from the community to stay in Memphis.If ever there is a time for Memphis to elect a black mayor and join&nbsp;Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans, and five of the nation's top 10&nbsp;cities, it is now. Timing, demographics and justice may be on its side.Census figures show that 55 percent of Memphis's 610,000 residents&nbsp;are black. And the U.S. Justice Department filed a voting rights suit&nbsp;against the city to abolish at-large council seats and run-off elections.Black leaders, who had never united behind a sole candidate for&nbsp;mayor despite only one black ever winning a citywide race, met during the&nbsp;summer to pick a consensus choice. That process ended up anything but&nbsp;unified when two coalitions warred over whose voice would be heeded: the&nbsp;traditional politicians led by U.S. Rep. Harold Ford or activists at a&nbsp;People's Convention.  Mr. Herenton emerged as the candidate of both, but&nbsp;not without casualties. Mr. Ford waited until the final week to lend his&nbsp;presence to the campaign and apparently chose not to issue a traditional&nbsp;endorsement ballot on Mr. Herenton's behalf.Charles Carpenter, Mr. Herenton's campaign manager, warns that no&nbsp;one should underestimate Mr. Herenton's appeal, which peaked after he&nbsp;decided to take the Atlanta job. &quot;At that point it was clear to him,&nbsp;clear to the community, that Willie Herenton was a leader, a role model,&nbsp;and a mentor.&quot;The incumbent has adopted the look of a winner, attending official&nbsp;functions, dropping in on shopping centers and making speeches only at&nbsp;private fund raisers.Mayor Hackett says he is running on his nine-year City Hall record,&nbsp;one he claims is marked by sound management of services, no tax increases&nbsp;and a thriving economy.Rarely does he mention Mr. Herenton by name, nor are race relations&nbsp;given much comment. Instead he points to six black top city directors -&nbsp;most appointed in the past two years - as examples of his administration&nbsp;of inclusion.Campaign manager Bill Boyd says the mayor might get up to 15 percent&nbsp;of the black vote as a result of black dissension.He also has nearly three times the campaign funds of Mr. Herenton,&nbsp;or $ 660,000, enabling him to barrage viewers this week with television&nbsp;ads.",0.064081027668,0.453277338603,660 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"June 5, 1991, Wednesday",356 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Dotheria Robinson&nbsp;was arrested in February 1990 for cashing a check that was drawn by a&nbsp;third party and given to her husband. The charge was later dismissed on a&nbsp;technicality. Nine months after her arrest, the McIntosh commission voted&nbsp;to suspend Mrs. Robinson indefinitely. Her suit, filed in U.S. District&nbsp;Court in Brunswick, claims the commission usurped the authority of Mrs.&nbsp;Robinson's boss, the tax commissioner, and failed to follow county policy&nbsp;on firing employees. The suit says commissioners routinely ignore policy&nbsp;when firing black employees, like Mrs. Robinson.

Mayor Dennis&nbsp;Trudeau said the Environmental Protection Agency provided a $ 2 million&nbsp;grant for the city's wastewater plant, which was built after three&nbsp;separate contracts were awarded for segments of the work. W.L. Carey&nbsp;Construction Co. was the low bidder on the first two contracts, but&nbsp;Beacon Industries Inc. was the low bidder on the third contract by about&nbsp;$ 269,000, Mayor Trudeau said. City officials gave the entire project to&nbsp;the Carey firm after it agreed to drop $ 100,000 off the price of each of&nbsp;the three contracts. Although the $ 300,000 discount on all three&nbsp;contracts made Carey the low overall bidder, EPA decided that Beacon&nbsp;should have been awarded the third contract. EPA has ordered the city to&nbsp;repay the $ 168,000 difference between the low bid and the Carey price on&nbsp;the third contract.

"He is Wheaties. He isNike.He is America. He would be the&nbsp;prototypical Republican if he weren't a Democrat.Yet of late, Michael Jordan's halo is teetering, threatening to&nbsp;tilt, and all because of a Meet-the-President photo shoot last week in&nbsp;the Rose Garden. COME AS IS, the invitation urged. BRING CHICAGO BULLS.&nbsp;BRING TROPHY. MOST IMPORTANT, BRING MICHAEL.&nbsp;For a change, even George was there.And Michael wasn't.In the aftermath, Jordan's absence was added to the growing list of&nbsp;national crises. He was found guilty of a conspiracy of one, of (ye&nbsp;gads!) orchestrating a solo plot, a snub, against the Prez.Children cried. Mothers cringed. Both suggested that Jordan be&nbsp;flogged with a bowl of wet Wheaties, or, at the least, be grounded by a&nbsp;pair of P.F. Flyers.Others, including members of the Chicago media, deemed a verbal&nbsp;spanking more appropriate. Consider that Chicago columnist Jay Mariotti,&nbsp;echoing the very serious sentiments of many, called the snub, &quot;about the&nbsp;most disturbing, irresponsible and irrational thing Jordan has done in&nbsp;public life.&quot;; Michael's virtues paling in comparisonJordan must indeed be a man of few sins. Unless we missed it, he&nbsp;does not use drugs. He pays his bills on time. He loves his children. In&nbsp;general, he comports himself like a gentleman, the same which can not&nbsp;always be said of his brethren.Larry Bird shoots his mouth off and often hits his own foot. Charles&nbsp;Barkley shoots his mouth off and hits both feet. Isiah Thomas, both feet&nbsp;and both ankles. Magic Johnson keeps mum. Much safer that way. Until&nbsp;recently, so did Jordan.First he hinted that he might prefer golf to the Olympics. Amid a&nbsp;sizable uproar, he quickly reconsidered. Then he was blamed - unfairly -&nbsp;for Thomas's absence on the U.S. squad. Now he is perceived as sticking&nbsp;out his very famous tongue at Bush.Hardly.Were he more of an activist, Jordan's absence might have suggested&nbsp;that Bush tend to the weeds in the back of his other garden, the one that&nbsp;provides a less-than-rosy vision of America, featuring its homeless, the&nbsp;health-care crisis, unemployed workers, our illiterate children.But Jordan's statement was personal and pragmatic, though impolitic&nbsp;as well. He simply chose to spend the final days of the offseason with&nbsp;his children, which, given the state of the American family, ought to be&nbsp;commended.; He owed fans answer, not justificationBush most assuredly will recover more quickly than our economy. So&nbsp;will the Bulls, even those angered by a perceived double standard, and so&nbsp;will Jordan, though the MVP has gained new insights into the plight of&nbsp;the superstar.The trouble with sports heroes is that they aren't angels. They may&nbsp;leap into the heavens but they eventually land, often with a thud. Even,&nbsp;the Michael Jordans.In one sense, his timing is lousy. Bird had Magic. Magic had Bird.&nbsp;They were basketball's dueling duo of the 80s, enemies, then rivals, and&nbsp;ultimately friends, each one's actions measured by the other's. Together,&nbsp;they shared the glories and the burdens of superstardom.&quot;I would always say, What would Larry do?' &quot; Magic once admitted,&nbsp;deep in thought. &quot; How would he react?' Having him out there . . . well,&nbsp;we helped each other's careers in a lot of different ways. We understand&nbsp;each other.&quot;But Jordan stands alone. He lacks the kinship of a Magic-Bird, and&nbsp;unlike his predecessors, veteran teammates with the stature of a McHale,&nbsp;Parish, DJ, Kareem, Wilkes, Worthy, Nixon. Jordan has only Jordan.&nbsp;Pippen? Not yet. Horace Grant? Just another good player. John Paxson?&nbsp;Right place at the right time.If Jordan is to be chided, it is only for this: He owed his fans the&nbsp;answer to his whereabouts. Not a justification. An answer.But irresponsible? Disturbing? Irrational? Nonsense.

"Pauly Chu, a kindergarten teacher at Canby Lane Elementary School,&nbsp;structures her class in the normal fashion of most other kindergarten&nbsp;teachers.They read some, do math, learn Chinese, take naps and have play time&nbsp;- yes, they have been learning Chinese.Mrs. Chu, a Chinese-born American citizen, spends at least 30&nbsp;minutes a day teaching the 5-year-olds numbers in Chinese, math on an&nbsp;abacus and Chinese characters.&nbsp;But she doesn't stop there. Some old Chinese culture is also&nbsp;incorporated into her classroom.Because, according to Mrs. Chu, the old way was the best way.&quot;A long time ago in China, the teacher was more important than the&nbsp;parents,&quot; Mrs. Chu said. &quot;Discipline and respect was incorporated in the&nbsp;school; the most important thing was respect to the teacher. But when I&nbsp;came to the United States, I saw that that's not always the case.&quot;Bowing when thankful is natural for the 15 students who sometimes&nbsp;wear Chinese farmer hats made out of paper. Five-year-old Michael&nbsp;Witherspoon wishes everybody would do it.&quot;Learning Chinese makes me happy,&quot; Michael said. &quot;I think everybody&nbsp;should bow and say thank you' because it's a really nice thing to do.&quot;Exposure is also important to Mrs. Chu. She believes understanding&nbsp;different cultures makes for better relations in the future.&quot;My students can see that I'm different from them, they know that&nbsp;that difference is that I'm Chinese,&quot; Mrs. Chu said. &quot;Sharing some of my&nbsp;culture with them helps them understand that difference is a way of life,&nbsp;that it could be good and there is no reason to feel threatened.&quot;Brown-eyed Benjamin Carson credits Mrs. Chu with helping him make&nbsp;his career choice. The 5-year-old Stone Mountain resident said he wants&nbsp;to be a Chinese-speaking &quot;rocketeer&quot; when he grows up.&quot;They love her - both kids and parents,&quot; said Mary Dugett, the&nbsp;school's principal. &quot;We have parents that come in wanting to see the&nbsp;teacher who teaches Chinese. After watching her, they inquire about&nbsp;getting their kid in her class.&quot;&quot;I couldn't learn Chinese at my old school,&quot; 5-year-old Desiree&nbsp;Hillman said. &quot;But Mrs. Chu is a Chinese teacher, and I like her because&nbsp;she teaches Chinese.&quot;Mrs. Chu said she's proud to have the opportunity to teach children&nbsp;another language.&quot;I really think Americans should learn more than one language,&quot; she&nbsp;said, &quot;and I'm happy to be able to contribute towards that goal.&quot;According to Mrs. Chu, the old way was the best way.The SchoolCanby Lane Elementary KindergartenThe teacherMrs. Pauly ChuThe classNikeAmoleKimberly BrownBenjamin CarsonShaka DennisonStacie EdwardsJohn R.

"They are the unsavory types you would not want around your children.&nbsp;If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware&nbsp;upon their departure.So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting&nbsp;five-figure contracts to try and sell you on what deodorant you should&nbsp;put under your arms?Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid&nbsp;distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles&nbsp;Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside&nbsp;and threw water on another fan last season.&nbsp;The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a&nbsp;former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger&nbsp;than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the&nbsp;Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive&nbsp;steroid test.So why would Gillette, the makers of Right Guard, spend money on&nbsp;these guys?&quot;We are playing off their bad boy image,&quot; says a spokesperson for&nbsp;N.W. Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. &quot;It's the way&nbsp;the campaign is supposed to work.&quot;&quot;Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,&quot; says Gary Wichard,&nbsp;Bosworth's agent.&nbsp; So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.&quot;To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,&quot; says David Falk, vice-&nbsp;chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host&nbsp;of athletes, including the Atlanta Hawks' Dominique Wilkins. &quot;But I've&nbsp;got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased&nbsp;awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.&quot;To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in&nbsp;contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.But what are the bounds?&quot;You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,&quot; says Bob&nbsp;Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San&nbsp;Francisco. &quot;With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea&nbsp;can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.&quot;Dorfman points to theNikeshoe commercial that ran after Barkley&nbsp;had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial,&nbsp;David Robinson, the clean-imaged center for the San Antonio Spurs and&nbsp;anotherNikeendorser, asks Barkley, &quot;Can you spell fine, Charles?&quot;Still, there is a line.&quot;For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of&nbsp; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving&nbsp;charge,&quot; Dorfman says.Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi&nbsp;Berra said, &quot;Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who&quot; back in the 1950s.&nbsp;And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday&nbsp;Night Fights.Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft&nbsp;drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches&nbsp;are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver&nbsp;Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.And while Sabatini and Steffi Graf, both tennis players, rank among&nbsp;the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is&nbsp;largely a man's game in the United States.&quot;Tennis and golf both have international appeal,&quot; says Clive Chajet,&nbsp;chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an&nbsp;identity consulting firm. &quot;But in the U.S. the hottest market right now&nbsp;are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.&quot;In the wider U.S. market, women athletes have a much more limited&nbsp;appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play&nbsp;tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just&nbsp;because Monica Seles wears the same kind.&quot;So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid&nbsp;athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the&nbsp;salaries their teams pay them.Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a&nbsp;Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is&nbsp;paying Jordan a reported $ 19 million over 10 years to try and get people&nbsp;to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan'sNike&nbsp;contract went unrevealed but advertising executives suspect it was the&nbsp;single largest endorsement deal ever.All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at&nbsp;$ 10 to $ 15 million yearly. His salary is $ 2.1 million annually.&quot;Michael transcends everything,&quot; says Chajet. &quot;His image has&nbsp;redefined marketing.&quot;&nbsp; Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped&nbsp;from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $ 5&nbsp;million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image&nbsp;is of common man perfection.&quot;It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a&nbsp;sought-after endorser,&quot; says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns&nbsp;Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. &quot;There has got to be personality and&nbsp;a sense of acceptance of the person.&quot;Despite the limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes&nbsp;have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their&nbsp;image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are&nbsp;former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger&nbsp;Jose Canseco.Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and&nbsp;steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins&nbsp;with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation&nbsp;for multiple traffic offenses. And after being a no-show at numerous&nbsp;public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could&nbsp;hear his side of the story.Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to&nbsp;cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone&nbsp;his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander&nbsp;Holyfield.&quot;Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,&quot; Dorfman says.&nbsp;&quot;He's scary . . . You have to have some pleasantness about you.&quot;A lack of &quot;pleasantness&quot; has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988&nbsp;Pepsi agreed to pay him about $ 1 million to push its products, but the&nbsp;contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former&nbsp;wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.&quot;There are only so many dollars out there for the credible&nbsp;athletes,&quot; says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former&nbsp;Brave Dale Murphy. &quot;The involvement costs are too high to gamble with.&nbsp;The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message&nbsp;out in front of the public.&quot;&quot;It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a&nbsp;star, there is some degree of risk,&quot; Chajet says.To most, the line is distinct: Law-breakers are taboo.&quot;On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of&nbsp;legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,&quot; says Lanktree.&nbsp;&quot;Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And&nbsp;I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to&nbsp;be all right.&quot;Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of&nbsp;sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records&nbsp;after testing positive.Though Johnson did not have a many lucrative endorsement contracts,&nbsp;the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international&nbsp;possibilities for him, Lanktree says.&quot;Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,&quot; she says. &quot;What he did was&nbsp;not illegal, but he totally lost all his value as a spokesperson .&quot;He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult,&nbsp;unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality&nbsp;cinched it.&quot;Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is&nbsp;a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-&nbsp;Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.&quot;Whatever Boggs's attitudes was, he was not seen by the people of&nbsp;Boston as s aying, Screw you. I don't care what you think,' &quot; she says.&nbsp;&quot;On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think&nbsp;that was very significant.&quot;Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing&nbsp;products.&quot;The Jordan deal was monstrous,&quot; says Dorfman. &quot;How much Gatorade&nbsp;will people have to drink for that much money to pay for itself? But I&nbsp;think what it says is that advertisers think the market is bottomless.&quot;&quot;More and more,&quot; says Lanktree. &quot;I don't know that there is a&nbsp;limit.&quot;",0.0748147091004,0.448472717758,1439 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"July 26, 1991, Friday",362 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Sometimes Father knows best. But other times you've got to make your&nbsp;own choices.That's a lesson Greg Asman learned in last year's AT&amp;T Collegiate&nbsp;Investment Challenge when he bought stock in his father's company,&nbsp;Schlumberger Industries - and lost money.&nbsp;&quot;That's the last time I'm going to do that,&quot; said Greg, a junior at&nbsp;North Springs High School in Atlanta.Luckily, he had stuffed his portfolio with other stocks, including&nbsp;NCR Corp.,NikeInc. and Walt Disney Co., so he still managed an&nbsp;imaginary four-month profit of about $ 200,000 on his $ 500,000 investment.This year, about 12 students from North Springs's 70-member chapter&nbsp;of Future Business Leaders of America are playing in the contest's high&nbsp;school division.

"Investors pushed stock prices sharply higher for much of the day&nbsp;Monday, although a late sell-off deflated most of the gains.The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip industrial stocks, up as much&nbsp;as 19 points just 15 minutes before the market's regular close, ended the&nbsp;day with a gain of 4.69 points to 2,919.05 in fairly heavy trading.&nbsp;That was enough to keep alive the market's advance, which began last&nbsp;week.

"&nbsp;'THEY kill for Reebok pumps. You only get mugged forNike-Air - they're commoner.' So I was informed by my 11-year-old son, who had just returned from the first day at his new secondary school wearing the gleaming pair ofNike-Airs which had gobbled up most of the household fund the day before.It was a remark going straight to the heart of a moral dilemma which, if the conversations I took part in during the last weeks of the holidays are anything to go by, has caught parents of children in our style-conscious society, where status currently resides in footwear, by the short and curlies. Should we succumb and fork out inordinate sums of money for shoes which, to the uninitiated, look much like those available at a fraction of the price, just because they carry the crucial name and have the attraction of added air?&nbsp;If common sense were the only guide, the answer should be a resounding no. But we are a child-centred generation of parents and we know only too well the depth of the anguish our young may feel if they cannot hold their own among their peer group. I still remember how mortified I felt when my mother adapted an ancient, baggy pair of her ski trousers for me, when everyone else on the school trip had the sleek, chic elasticated kind. For our kids, starting at new schools, there seemed to be a particular urgency to reach a decision.But there was a practical side to the dilemma. In the US there have been cases of youngsters murdered for their expensive, ultra-fashionable shoes, and not long ago the son of a friend of mine was 'persuaded' by a couple of heavies at a north London bowling alley to accompany them to a quiet spot and part company with his new, modish trainers. What sort of parent is willingly going to put their kid to that kind of risk when a pair of cheapo, label-less shoes are risk-free?Statistically, my son pointed out, this argument is thin - no more than half a dozen cases of nasty incidents concerning shoes have been reported and in our circle just two are known about. And, he asked in his most persuasive, hectoring manner, how many pairs of fashionable shoes are bought and worn by young people?But let's get to the heart of the moral dilemma. How can we right-on parents, desperately trying to impart values which will challenge the superficial materialism of our age - a culture in which the adman rules and you are admired more for how you look than who you are - go out and buy our kids these absurdly over-priced shoes, thus confirming the idea that this is where their status lies?The British Telecom lines crackled with the anguished sound of the older generation battling with its conscience as the start of the new term drew near.My conclusion was that there are times, the first day at a new school being one of them, when my principles, my pious pride in being seen to provide the right ethical environment for my young, have to go hang. Watching Cato putting on his new purple and white shoes with enormous pride, seeing the boost they gave to his confidence as he set off to school, I was glad he had them. It might not be the most satisfactory or the most enduring way to build self-esteem but as a one-off it had real value.He arrived home after the first couple of days happy with the school, pleased to be making new friends, excited even about his homework. I can't help feeling that if he had not felt so sure about his image, he might not have felt so positive about all these other things.I was not, apparently, alone in my judgment. Walking into the entrance hall of my son's new school that first day, the most striking sight was a dazzling array of feet in state-of-the-art footwear.",0.145293753865,0.542115543187,620 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 3, 1991, Thursday",367 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Leo Wilson Jr., 16, was shot to death for hisNikesneakers and satin sports jacket, police say.  Police were questioning three people ages 18 to 22 in Wilson's murder, said Lt. Steven Jacobsmeyer of the homicide division.  A charge of first-degree murder against one of the three was taken under advisement Friday by the St. Louis circuit attorney's office.  Police were continuing to investigate, Jacobsmeyer said.  Wilson was shot moments after leaving his girlfriend's house shortly before midnight Monday in the 6000 block of Etzel Avenue, in the Cabanne neighborhood, police said. He was robbed of his black-and-whiteNikeshoes and a satin black-and-silver jacket bearing the logo of the Los Angeles Raiders, said homicide Detective Joe Nickerson.  Wilson lived nearby, in the 5800 block of Page Boulevard.  He was shot once in the abdomen and twice in the leg. He was found on a driveway on Etzel and died at 6:50 a.m. Tuesday at Barnes Hospital.  A neighbor of Wilson's girlfriend told police that she had heard what sounded like Wilson say, ''Are you all going to kill me?'' That was followed by several gunshots, the witness told police, Nickerson said.  Police say the three being questioned accosted Wilson. They were part of a group of five who had committed five other robberies between 11:30 p.m. and midnight Monday. In each case, the youths took satin pro team jackets, satin caps or tennis shoes from their victims.&nbsp;Nickerson said the three youths claimed to be part of the ''Crips'' gang.  But Lt. Thomas Malecek of the police department's juvenile division said the youths were probably gang ''wannabes.'' Teen-agers in cities along the coasts have been killed for their sports jackets or sneakers, and robberies of those items are on the increase in St.  Louis, said Malecek. Teen-agers here have been shot for their jackets or shoes, but Malecek said this was the first case he knew of in which a youth had been killed.  ''It's becoming a growing problem, because apparently these items have a lot more identity value than in the past,'' Malecek said.  Wilson's mother, Reata Wilson, said Friday that she could not believe her only son had been killed for a pair of sneakers and a jacket.  ''If they wanted it, they could have took it and let my child live,'' she said. ''He was a good child, very playful, and always kept us laughing.  We're going to miss him.'' Leo Wilson was a sophomore at Southwest High School and enjoyed weight-lifting, his mother said. Among the other survivors are two sisters: Michelle Wilson, 19, and Cher Wilson, 15.  Reata Wilson said her son had wanted to start his own carpentry business when he graduated from high school. She said he liked to work with wood.  ''We've got a lot of pieces here at the house that he made himself,'' she said.  ''I want the police to find out who did this, so that person can be punished,'' she said.

"&nbsp;SHOOTING A BULLET with a bullet is, in effect, what the Army's Patriot missiledoes when it kills an incoming Scud.  So far, the Patriot appears to be knocking down each Scud that has come under fire. This success stems from a mixture of high technology and luck.  Finding a defense against ballistic missiles - missiles whose flight path forms a high, inverted ''U'' at thousands of miles a hour - has become for military researchers the hunt for the Holy Grail.  For more than 40 years, the United States has invested tens of billions of dollars in trying to develop an anti-missile missile. TheNike-Zeus program of the '50s gave way to the Spartan and Sprint programs of the '60s.  The search slowed slightly after 1972, when the United States and the Soviets signed an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting each to only one anti-missile launching area.  Still, anti-missile research continued through the '70s. It exploded in the '80s under President Ronald Reagan, who launched the Strategic Defense Initiative - instantly dubbed ''Star Wars.'' Although the Patriot incorporates some of the Star Wars technology, the program itself dates back almost 30 years and is rooted in the Sam-D anti-aircraft missile of the early '60s.  At that time, the Army wanted: A replacement for itsNikeHercules (a high-altitude anti-aircraft missile) and its Hawk, at least as its medium-altitude role.  A more self-contained missile unit, or battery, that would allow soldiers to move it more quickly around the battlefield.&nbsp;The most accurate missile in the world - a specification that caused big problems.  This cutting-edge-of-technology approach nearly killed the Patriot in Congress because it added billions of dollars in cost and forced a 15-year development program.  But in the end, the extra money and time let the Patriot blast Scuds from the sky.  Each Patriot battery has a radar set, a command center, an electric power plant and eight boxy ''launching stations,'' which look like large freight containers, each with four missiles. All the equipment rides on vehicles or trailers.  The core of the system is called ''phased-array'' radar - the latest radar, in which the antenna stands still while the electronic signals move in high-speed bursts.  The radar first detects the incoming Scuds, then ''tracks'' them - plots their course - and finally guides the Patriots to the Scuds. The radar performs the tasks of nine types of radar of the oldNikeHercules and Hawk missile batteries.  The solid-fuel Patriot is 17.5 feet long and 16 inches in diameter. In theory, even a near-miss with its 200-pound fragmentation warhead will kill a Scud. But for all practical purposes, the speeds involved demand a direct hit.  The Scud is coming in at several thousand miles a hour, and the Patriot is going out at more than three times the speed of sound - about 2,200 mph at sea level.  That makes timing critical, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham of High Frontier, a private group that pushes Star Wars.  ''You've got only a couple of minutes,'' Graham said, to detect and track the Scuds and fire the Patriots. Even with their range of more than 40 miles, the Patriots destroy the Scuds only 2 to 4 seconds before the Scuds would otherwise hit.  At this point, the element of luck is critical.  Graham said the Patriot crews were improving the odds by double-teaming each Scud with two Patriot missiles.  But continued success for the Patriot depends on two critical factors: Whether the Scuds will be fired at targets within the Patriot's protective umbrella.  Whether the Scuds will be fired in limited barrages.  The Patriot has a limited ''footprint'' - the area it can defend.  ''The exact footprint is classified, so I'm not going to give you that,'' Graham said. ''But I can say the Patriot is designed to defend something the size of an airfield rather than an entire city.'' And just as the Patriot's area is limited, so is its ability to cope with mass waves of missiles.  Although the radar is said to be able to track 100 targets at a time, Graham warned that the number that can be actually shot at is limited.  ''Each battery has eight launchers with four missiles each, so that's 16 targets,'' Graham said, assuming two Patriots for each Scud.  Before the war, the Army had four Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia. Graham said he had not heard of any more being sent. But he says that given the experience of recent days, more might be.  Few people say the Patriot fulfills the promise of Star Wars. An Iraqi Scud is a far easier target than a Soviet intercontinental missile with maneuverable warheads.  But as long as Iraq keeps hitting warfare's equivalent of high pop flies, Patriot crews should continue to catch the Scuds.",0.111924255082,0.425857699805,794 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 7, 1991, Monday",369 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;At least three National League club owners say they will not support any move by John McMullen to sell his Houston Astros to out-of-town buyers who could move the team to another city.  ''I can't see going along with that,'' Pittsburgh Pirates owner Doug Danforth told The Houston Chronicle.  Bill Giles of Philadelphia said he would not approve of moving the Astros from the Astrodome ''unless they could prove it was an extreme situation.'' Bob Lurie of San Francisco said he would not vote for such a move.  McMullen and Louis Susman, a former Cardinals official who now works for Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm retained by the Astros, met with the eight-member major league ownership committee in Santa Monica, Calif.  Meanwhile, Commissioner Fay Vincent formed a committee to study the conditions under which major-league teams would be able to transfer cities.

Jets general manager Mike Smith has all but confirmed that he has offered the NHL job to John Paddock, 37.&nbsp;But Paddock, who coached the Rangers' American Hockey League affiliate in Binghamton, N.Y., last year, has not yet been given clearance by the Rangers to sign a contract.

Lindros Bidding Stirs NHL NHL teams are lining up to try to put together a package for highly touted prospect Eric Lindros, who has said he doesn't want to play in Quebec, Hartford Whalers general manager Ed Johnston said.  Quebec has said it wants to take Lindros with the first pick, but Lindros has indicated he will skip the NHL draft on June 22 and will attend the newly formed Continental Hockey League draft on Thursday, Johnston said.  Nordiques officials said they had not heard that Lindros would skip the NHL draft or that he would attend the CHL's draft.  BASKETBALL Warriors' Richmond Arrested Golden State Warriors star Mitch Richmond was arrested on traffic violations in Manhattan, Kan., early Wednesday. Richmond, a former Kansas State star who was the NBA's rookie of the year in 1989, was arrested for traveling 43 mph in a 30 mph zone, not having a driver's license in his possession and for refusing to take a preliminary breath test, the Manhattan police said.

"&nbsp;WHILE MICHAEL, 11, tried on the Air Jordans his parents had promised him for basketball camp, his 8-year-old sister, Kate, fondled the little-girl-sized Reebok Pump from the display. It's her dream shoe, but at $80, her parents won't go for it.  What makes it so cool?  ''When you push the pump button,'' she explained, ''it makes you, like, run faster, or it makes you, like, jump better. It helps you do aerobics. It feels like air is floating inside of your shoe.'' Then, ''when you don't want to run real fast or jump, you press the button'' and the sneaker deflates.  How does she know all this if she's never worn a pair?  ''Everybody knows about them,'' she said, clearly appalled that I'd had to ask. ''Like, it's a popular shoe.'' One more child hornswoggled by advertising, you might think, but no.  Reebok's ads don't claim the Pump - which pumps air into bladders in the shoe's lining to create a closer fit - makes you run faster or jump higher.  Reebok's John Morgan admits right up front that it doesn't.  And he's right. Zillions, the kid version of Consumer Reports, proved it.  They heard the same run-faster, jump-higher playground myth and decided to test it out. When they outfitted their kid testers in three kinds of shoes - the Reebok Pump, theNikeAir Jordan and theNikeQuantum Force - they found that the kids jumped to exactly the same heights in all three models, and actually ran a little bit slower in the Pumps, which were noticeably heavier than the other two.&nbsp;When the testers were told they could keep the shoes they liked best, nobody chose Pumps.  According to Morgan, those results may need updating soon. Since Reebok introduced the first Pump, he says, they've streamlined its air-pump technology. The Pump they'll introduce in August, he says, weighs only 15 ounces per shoe, more than 5 ounces lighter than the model Zillions tested.  It still won't make you run faster or jump higher. What it does do, Morgan says, is reduce ankle injuries. He says tests at the University of California at Berkeley matched 200 kids in low-tops against 200 kids in regular high-tops and 200 kids in Pumps - and found that the Pump cut ankle injuries by 60 percent.  So where'd the run-faster, jump-higher rap come from? Morgan doesn't know, but it doesn't surprise him. Kids, he says, ''have a tendency to build stories around shoes.'' For instance, a black high-t op basketball shoe Reebok happened to introduce shortly after the death of University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias came to be known in the Washington, D.C., area as the Len Bias Memorial Shoe. And, on New England playgrounds, the black high-top Pump that the Boston Celtics' Dee Brown wears - and that he so effectively called attention to during the NBA All Stars Slam-Dunk Contest last February by pumping and repumping before every try - is known as the Deebok.",0.193515823257,0.479122888606,480 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"October 22, 1991, Tuesday",371 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

It's hip-length for greater maneuverability and lined at the waistband with gripper elastic.

Air Huarache.Nikehas found a way to provide a minimalist running shoe that's packed with extras to make your running faster and more comfortable.

The over-sized container has a no-slip rubber strip around the middle and a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning.

This not only keeps sweat from dripping in your eyes but holds the glasses snugly to your head. Call Smith at (208) 726-4477 for the deal er nearest you.  Individual Trainer.

"&nbsp;INDIANAPOLIS - Stars surround Richard Keene. This is his chance to see if he belongs.  And maybe, in a way, he doesn't. Not in this setting, at least.  The setting is theNikeABCD Basketball Camp. ABCD stands for Academic Betterment and Career Development, and the camp's devotion of about five hours each day to preparing the 120 high school campers for the academic side of college life makes it unique among summer basketball camps.  That and the fact that those 120 campers come by invitation only. They're regarded as the top high school players in the nation.  On paper, Keene fits right in. He will be a senior at Collinsville High, which has a rich basketball tradition. He stands 6 feet 5 but plays with guard skills, has started for three seasons, has led his team in scoring for two seasons. He hits the 3-pointer with regularity and is a better passer than shooter.  Among senior off-guards, Keene is ranked No. 17 in the nation.  No question that he merited the invitation to the ninth annualNikecamp, which was moved to Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis this year after developing its reputation at Princeton University. The atmosphere is first-class: every player a major-college prospect, almost every face in the stands one of a major-college coach.  They haven't seen Keene at his best.  ''I talked to a lot of the coaches recruiting me before I came here,'' Keene said. ''They told me a little of what this would be like.&nbsp;They just said, 'You won't get the ball much. So don't get frustrated by that.' '' The players were divided into 12 teams of 10 players each. They play two games a day, with each playing about 21 minutes in each game. Keene usually was on the floor with Rasheed Wallace, a 6-10 center from Philadelphia; Otis Hill, a 6-8 power forward from Pleasantville (N.Y.) High; Danta Bright, a 6-6 forward from Baltimore's Dunbar High; and Kiwame Garris, a 6-1 point guard from Westinghouse High in Chicago.  Often, Keene would be standing wide open on the wing while one of his ''teammates'' stood with the ball on the other side, guarded to the point of suffocation; yet still that player would pump up a shot, which often was jammed back in his face, or would drive to the basket and shovel the ball upward through a sea of arms.  On the rare occasion when Keene would touch the ball, he might make an impressive pass - he had five assists in his first game. Or he might shoot.  But shooting twice every five minutes doesn't give Keene the chance to show how hot a scoring hand he can have.  ''I just can't get a rhythm going,'' Keene said. ''Really, I'm just playing defense and hoping for the best. All I can do is try as hard as I can with whatever I'm able to do. There's not a whole lot of attention to team play out there, though.'' Keene wouldn't mind impressing some of those coaches in the stands, though it's not exceedingly necessary. He already is busy listening to the likes of Bobby Knight, Dale Brown, Lou Henson, Roy Williams and Jim Harrick.  Mike Krzyzewski, head coach of national champ Duke, was in the stands; the coaches can't discuss recruits, but a peek at Krzyzewski's camp roster showed he had Keene's name marked in yellow highlighter.  Keene hopes to leave Indianapolis with his top-20 standing among off-guards intact because he'd like to have a chance to play in some of next spring's all-star games.  ''Those rankings are nice, but it's not really that important to me,'' Keene said. ''I'd like to be up there as high as I can be, sure. But I'm looking to get to college.'' He will get to college, and he won't have to thumb for his ride, either.  That is safe no matter how he plays at theNikecamp.  No, Keene isn't quite as concerned with the on-court education he is gaining in Indy as he is in the off-court lessons. The longer he is in the camp, the more self-assured he becomes that he will be able to play big-time college basketball and will be able to handle the academics side of that life.  ''It feels good to be here with all of these players,'' Keene said. ''The first night before we played here, I was a little nervous. I've never really been in a situation like this before.'' Keene's name has been listed among the best for about eight months. But his abilities hadn't been measured alongside so many others with similar abilities until this week. He was supposed to play in some top camps last summer, then had to sit out because of a broken wrist.  Suddenly, after an outstanding junior season, he is the focus of tremendous recruiting attention.  ''The great thing about being here is that I know that I'm not the only one going through it,'' Keene said. ''I've got such a big decision I'm going to have to make, and now I'm getting to talk to a whole bunch of other guys that are making the same decision as me. It really is helping out.  ''It's kind of funny, but I'm ranked 17th at my position and my roommate up here for the week is ranked 18th. We're talking a lot.'' Keene's roommate is Dante Calabria, from Beaver Falls, Pa. He is a fraction of an inch shorter than Keene. They found they shared more in common than their position and hit it off from the start.  ''It kind of feels like I'm meeting guys I'll be seeing for a long time in the future,'' Keene said. ''I'm sure I'll play against some of the other guys here when we all get into college.'' He also will know much more about college life than he would have otherwise. Keene recently found out he passed the testing requirement under Proposition 48 eligibility guidelines, so the test preparations aren't something he needs anymore. But the other hours of the day have been beneficial, he said.  ''It's fun, but not too much fun,'' Keene said. ''I'm not having a bad time. The fun part is when I'm out there playing. The rest of it, it's kind of like school. That's something you have to do in order to be able to play the basketball part.''",0.188286749482,0.495762594893,988 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"November 1, 1991, Friday",373 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Q: How come baseball coaches wear baseball caps but football coaches don't wear football helmets?  A: Because football helmets are equipment, good only for playing football, while baseball caps are clothing, and can be worn virtually anywhere by anybody.  The equipment/clothing distinction is more fluid than you might think. For instance, D'Artagnan's sword was equipment, but what about the swords that are part of the dress uniforms of men - whether Knights of Columbus or Army officers - who never use them and may not even know how? These non-fencers' swords are elements of costume, just like their epaulettes and brass buttons.  Until 10 years ago, hiking boots were equipment; now most of them are clothes. One result: Hiking boot sales have tripled.  A couple of weeks ago I tried on a 5-pound pair of serious-equipment-type hiking boots, the kind designed for people who feel obliged to climb tall mountains just because they're there. They felt like a couple of concrete blocks strapped to my feet - and not for nothing. You need that rigidity, the salesman explained, if you want to put on some crampons and walk straight up an iced-over waterfall or traverse a glacier.  Of course, most people who want to get out into the outdoors and have fun have something less ambitious in mind, like a 3- or 4-mile hike with the family. Or just something different, like trail-running or a hell-for-leather ride on a mountain bike. Something you could almost do in sneakers, except that this is a culture that's managed to convince 12-year-olds that they need $125 basketball shoes to ride the school bus, so nobody has to tell these hikers and bikers and trail-runners that they need special shoes, shoes that at least look like equipment.&nbsp;They don't need the full steel shanks and stiff leather of waterfall-walkers, and they won't put up with the weight, or put in the month or two it takes to break a pair in.  And they don't have to. Lightweight, instantly comfortable hiking boots were first introduced 10 years ago; Hi-Tec's Sierra Lite andNike'sLava Dome were among the first.  ''We basically made our running shoes more rugged,''Nike'sCraig Duerr says.  There's still some arguing about whether the lightweights were designed to meet the needs of casual hikers - or just to create a new market niche athletic shoe companies could fill.  Whichever, lightweight hikers were a big success. Art Kenyon of Vasque, an old-line hiking boot manufacturer, estimates that today, the lightweights account for 60 percent to 65 percent of the market.  According to a survey by the National Sporting Goods Association, sales of hiking boots nearly tripled over the past five years - though hiking increased by only 30 percent. What this must mean is that lots of the people who buy hiking boots aren't hiking in them.  Tom Doyle, spokesman for the association, says that ''about 60 percent of athletic shoes are never used for their intended purpose.'' But, when most hiking boots weighed 5 pounds and took weeks to break in, hardly anybody bought them to mow the lawn in. (Though, in the late 1960s, people who'd bought them for mountaineering sometimes wore them to English class as a badge of outdoorsy cool.) The lightweights, Kenyon says, are more ''multiuse'' - in other words, they're clothes, not equipment. He says people wear them ''to watch the kids play football, mow the grass, clean out the garage,'' and landscapers wear them as work boots because they're ''not too dorky'' to wear after work.  Now lightweight hikers are mutating again to produce a new shoe category designed for what the manufacturers call ''outdoor cross-training.'' Outdoor cross-trainers, clearly inspired by the success of the geographically non-specific cross-trainers that hit the market a couple of years ago, are designed for trail-running, mountain-biking and hiking.  You might not think those three activities would attract enough people to sustain a whole shoe category, and you'd probably be right. But Dave Getchell, Backpacker Magazine's equipment editor, points out that, though only a limited number of people actually hike, run trails and ride mountain bikes, lots more like the idea and may want ''to identify with these nice green activities'' by wearing the shoes, ''just the way people who live in the suburbs drive Jeep Cherokees and kids who don't play basketball wear Air Jordans.''",0.151741341991,0.476931818182,734 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"November 16, 1991, Saturday",375 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;QUICK. What are the best-selling athletic shoes of the moment?  You'd be right if you saidNike(particularly ones in the Air series, as in Air Jordan basketball shoes and Bo Jackson cross-trainers), Reebok (the Pump series is hot, Blacktop and otherwise) and L.A. Gear (especially for little kids).  And don't forget good, old Keds.  While everybody and their teen-aged brother has been buying $100-plus, status sports shoes, Keds have been steadily sneaking out of the stores.  For the last 75 years, Keds has been cranking out canvas sneakers with blue labels on the heels and surviving all the trends.  Mark Waldman, president of Lauries Shoes, which just opened the nation's first Keds store in Chesterfield Mall, said that when status tennis shoes were in, ''Keds kept selling.  ''Then it was running shoes . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then it was aerobic shoes . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then cross-trainers . . . and Keds kept selling.  ''Then cute little styles from L.A. Gear. . . .'' And, well, you get the idea. Keds sold 20 million pairs last year alone, giving it a 5.1 percent piece of the $5.3 billion athletic footwear market.  Not too shabby for a humble sneaker that can be traced back to Charles Goodyear's discovery in the 1800s of the vulanization process that enabled manufacturers to use heat to meld rubber to cloth.  At the turn of the century, the rubber footwear divisions of the U.S.  Rubber Co. were turning out shoes under 30 different brand names.&nbsp;When the company decided in 1916 to consolidate the shoes under one name, it originally settled on ''Peds,'' from the Latin word for foot. That trademark was held by other firms, so Peds became Keds, and the rest. . . .  Well, you know.  ''We've had this store for 40 years,'' said Waldman of his family's first shoe store situated in Glendale, ''and Keds have always been strong because Keds are just Keds. They're classics.  ''Right now, Keds is probably feeling one of the biggest explosions (in sales) it has had in many, many years.'' One important reason for that, Waldman said, is because the basic, canvas shoe - the Champion Oxford - sells for only $26 at full retail.  ''They sell like crazy because of the price,'' he said.  A spokeswoman for Footlocker, which has several locations in St. Louis, said Air Jordans (priced at $80 to $130) and Bo Jackson crosstrainers ($110) are ''flying out of the stores.'' The same is reported by a spokesman for Athlete's Foot stores, who adds to the list Reebok's Boulevards, from the ''Blacktop'' series. ''But,'' he added, ''we're doing very well with some of our special sale shoes,'' which are not the high-profile, high-priced shoes, but basicNikeAir cross-trainers or shoes from the Reebok ''Classics'' line priced in the $45 to $60 range.  Phil Landes, general manager for the Omni sporting goods stores here, saidNikeand Reebok are ''beginning to feel some price resistence'' from customers because of the cost of the high-profile shoes.  ''Once the price starts going over $70,'' Landes said, ''parents start going, 'Whoa.' '' By spring, he continued, ''you'll b e seeing more basic athletic shoes and more plain white shoes'' from the big manufacturers at prices less likely to make a parent's heart stop.  Pretty much what Keds has known all along.  Women and teen-aged girls account for about 50 percent of the Keds sales for Lauries, and Waldman said that both price and a return to more feminine clothing styles have caused many women to abandon the chunkier athletic shoes for the softer-looking Keds.  Then there's a matter of comfort. ''Every shoe company is finding that the comfort shoe is here to stay,'' Waldman said by way of explaining the popularity of Keds and Keds' 18-month-old line called Essentials.  Keds describes Essentials as ''lifestyle'' shoes. Waldman elaborated a bit, saying the shoes are made by combining ''rubber, comfort bottoms with neat tops.'' Included in this group are suede chukka boots that come in a range of colors, skimmers with a variety leather, suede or metallic tops, and leather oxfords. Prices rarely exceed $40 for any Keds shoe.  Gordon Edwards, regional sales manager for Keds, said that until about a year and a half ago, the East Coast and the South had been the best markets for Keds, but that the company's fastest growth these days is in the Midwest.  ''Right now,'' he continued, ''we're on fire in St. Louis. Famous and Dillard's can't get enough shoes.'' And they're selling well at J.C. Penney and Sears stores, and at the many other shoes stores that offer Keds.  What's different about the new Lauries Keds store in is that it offers every style and size of men's, women's and children's shoes made by Keds - including hard to fit. The women's basic, canvas oxford, for example, will be available in 18 colors and patterns for spring. This includes the plain, white canvas oxford, which is available in more than 150 sizes.  When Waldman and his brother, Scott, proposed the idea of opening the store, Edwards said, ''It was a natural because of what Lauries has done in the children's business, and because you're dealing with two companies that have been in business a long time.'' The Chesterfield location, Edwards continued, was a natural, too, ''because there are kids all over West County.'' Keds worked with the Waldmans on the concept for the store and the design, which includes a bright, blue neon Keds logo over the entrance. So far, Waldman said, sales have exceeded original expectations.  That's something executives at Keds headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., are watching closely.  ''If this continues to be successful,'' said Keds spokeswoman Joy Pratt, ''we absolutely will consider doing the same thing with other stores in other cities. We've already been approached by people in a couple of other markets.'' Pratt attributes the early success of the Chesterfield store partly to Keds' price and quality.  ''It's a brand people grew up with and are going back to,'' she said.  ''Keds fit right in with this whole '90s, back-to-basics attitude.''",0.171818954855,0.449302978767,1015 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"December 17, 1991, Tuesday",377 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;America's fascination with fitness is muscling up business for sporting goods dealers, officials in the industry say.  And its adulation of athletes is pumping up demand for athletic shoes and clothing. Sales have been rising like a 400-foot homer, with a downward curve not yet in sight.  ''People want to stay fit, and sports is an easy and fun way to do it,'' said editor Steve Fechter of The Sporting Goods Dealer, published here.  Celebrity athletes underline the fun in their paid endorsements.NikeInc.  has Bo Jackson, a star in two sports, dancing in an ad for cross-trainers and Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls dunking a basketball to plug Air Jordans.  The hoopla,Nikeand other companies hope, will send some of the masses out to play or, at least, get them to dress for play. With every convert, retailers gain potential sales of specialty shoes, gear and clothing.  Sporting goods sales in those three categories reached nearly $30 billion last year, up about 4 percent over the previous year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, based in Mount Prospect, Ill.  Baby boomers in their 40s are finally realizing that they are not invincible, said Larry Weindruch, a spokesman for the association.  ''They've started to take care of their bodies.'' At the same time, many of the boomers' children - even non-athletic ones - are pressing their parents to spend chunks of the back-to-school budget on highly advertised athletic shoes like high-tops and Pumps.&nbsp;Sales of athletic shoes got really hot in the early 1980s when walking around in this brand or that ''became cool,'' Weindruch said.  Among the companies that have capitalized on this fever is Woolworth Corp.'s Foot Locker, a rapidly growing chain that sel ls athletic shoes and clothing.  Foot Locker topped a survey by Sports Trend of the 100 biggest sporting goods retailers. Sports Trend, a trade publication, estimated Foot Locker's sales last year to be $975 million at nearly 1,300 stores, 14 in this area.  A sister division - Lady Foot Locker - gathered more than $250 million in sales, Sports Trend estimated. A new concept, Kids Foot Locker, is gaining a following in the younger set.  The founding of Foot Locker dates to 1975, but other chains have sprung up more recently to cash in on the spell sports seem to cast.  Sports Authority, which entered the St. Louis market this summer with three stores, started in 1987 with just one outlet. By the end of this year, it expects to have 36.  The chain picked St. Louis as one of its early locations because ''we think it's a growing community,'' said President Jack Smith in an interview last month. ''St. Louis has always been a major-league city.'' Chris Schwartz, president of MC Sporting Goods Inc., agrees. Retailers find a ''very sports-minded enthusiast in St. Louis,'' he said.  Businesses have lined up to cater to this crowd. The Yellow Pages here list more than 100 retailers in the sporting goods category, and those listings omit discount and department stores, which also are major players.  Kmart Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., J.C. Penney Co. and Target all rank in the top 10 in Sports Trend's annual survey of sporting goods sales.  Yet competition for sporting goods sales in St. Louis ''is not any worse than we find in other cities,'' said Schwartz, speaking from his headquarters in Grand Rapids, Mich.  Schwartz opened 10 MC Sporting Goods stores here last month (transformed from Gart Brothers/Casey's Sports Stores). MC bought a group of 20 Gart stores earlier this year.  Although the number of sporting goods stores nationwide is growing, the rate of growth is not that fast, said Weindruch of the National Sporting Goods Association. The bigger story, he said, is that these stores seem to be owned by fewer companies.  For example, a company called Thrifty Corp., based in Los Angeles, is the parent of three major sporting goods chains - Gart, MC, and Big 5 Sporting Goods, based in California.  And Kmart Corp. sold more than $1 billion worth of sporting goods last year if you count the $100 million contribution from The Sports Authority, one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sports Trend estimates.  ''Big companies are getting bigger at the expense of some of the smaller, independent sporting goods retailers,'' Weindruch said.  To compete, independent retailers are using ''niche marketing,'' Weindruch said. They take one or two things they're best at and ''try to be awfully good at that and really not concern themselves with things they aren't so strong in,'' he said.  Three brothers - John, Bob and Rick McArthur - have one niche in St. Louis with their four stores called Johnny Mac's Sporting Goods, in business for more than 25 years.  Selling goods to teams and schools makes up half the company's business, said Bob McArthur, general manager. The company gets its name across by sponsoring more than 100 baseball, softball and soccer teams a year, McArthur said.  Inside the store, Johnny Mac concentrates on products for team sports, plus services like sharpening skates and relacing baseball gloves.  Some of its main competition in St. Louis comes from mass merchants that sell the goods but don't offer the services, McArthur said.  Sportsprint Inc., another company with a focus on team equipment and sportswear, has five locations here.  It finds a second niche in producing licensed sportswear, handling ''all the graphics from start to finish,'' said Ralph F. Rockamann Jr., president.  The company is licensed with most colleges and universities, he said.  Licensed products are the sole focus of Superstars, also based in St.  Louis.  Founded in 1988, the company expanded outside this area and now has 27 stores in 11 states. Five of the stores are in malls in this area.  Tom Noblitt, president, said the company sells anything with a team name on it - from jerseys to waste baskets to barbecue grills.  Sales of licensed sporting goods continue to excel. Last year, they rose by 5 percent to about $2 billion, said Karen Raugust of the Licensing Letter, a trade publication.  With figures like that in mind, Superstars plans to expand aggressively.  Noblitt said three more stores might open by the end of the year. He qualified his plans by saying the company would be watching the economy.  But he may not need to, according to Weindruch of the National Sporting Goods Association.  The sporting goods industry grows even in periods of recession, Weindruch said. ''We outperformed virtually all retail categories'' in the recession of 1981 and 1982, he said.",0.137628458498,0.385911286781,1101 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"September 11, 1991",379 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;They are the unsavory types you would not want around your children. If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware upon their departure.  So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting five-figure contracts to try to sell you on what deodorant you should put under your arms?  Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside and threw water on another fan last season.  The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive steroid test.  So why would Gillette, the maker of Right Guard, spend money on these guys?  ''We are playing off their bad boy image,'' says a spokesperson for N.W.  Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. ''It's the way the campaign is supposed to work.'' ''Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,'' says Gary Wichard, Bosworth's agent.  So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.  ''To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,'' says David Falk, vice-chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host of athletes. ''But I've got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.''&nbsp;To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.  But what are the bounds? ''You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,'' says Bob Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San Francisco. ''With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.'' Dorfman points to theNikeshoe commercial that ran after Barkley had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial, David Robinson, the clean-imaged center for the San Antonio Spurs and anotherNikeendorser, asks Barkley, ''Can you spell fine, Charles?'' Still, there is a line.  ''For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of (Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving charge,'' Dorfman says.  Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi Berra said, ''Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who'' back in the 1950s. And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday Night Fights.  Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.  And while Sabatini and Steffi Gr af, both tennis players, rank among the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is largely a man's game in the United States.  ''Tennis and golf both have international appeal,'' says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an identity consulting firm. ''But in the U.S. the hottest market right now are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.  ''In the wider U.S. market, women (athletes have a much more limited appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just because Monica Seles wears the same kind.'' So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the salaries their teams pay them.  Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is paying Jordan a reported $19 million over 10 years to try and get people to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan'sNikecontract went unrevealed but advertising executives suspect it was the single largest endorsement deal ever.  All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at $10 to $15 million yearly. His salary is $2.1 million annually.  ''Michael transcends everything,'' says Chajet. ''His image has redefined marketing.'' Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $5 million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.  Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image is of common man perfection.  ''It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a sought-after endorser,'' says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. ''There has got to be personality and a sense of acceptance of the person.'' Despite the limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco.  Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation for multiple traffic offenses. And after being a no-show at numerous public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could hear his side of the story.  Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.  ''Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,'' Dorfman says. ''He's scary. You have to have some pleasantness about you.'' A lack of ''pleasantness'' has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988 Pepsi agreed to pay him about $1 million to push its products, but the contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.  ''There are only so many dollars out there for the credible athletes,'' says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former Brave Dale Murphy.  ''The involvement costs are too high to gamble with. The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message out in front of the public.'' ''It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a star, there is some degree of risk,'' Chajet says.  To most, the line is distinct: Lawbreakers are taboo.  ''On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,'' says Lanktree. ''Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to be all right.'' Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records after testing positive.  Though Johnson did not have a many lucrative endorsement contracts, the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international possibilities for him, Lanktree says.  ''Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,'' she says. ''What he did was not illegal, but he totally lost all his value (as a spokesperson.  ''He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult, unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality cinched it.'' Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.  She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.  ''Whatever Boggs's attitudes was, he was not seen by the people of Boston as s aying, 'I don't care what you think,' '' she says. ''On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think that was very significant.'' Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing products.  ''The Jordan deal was monstrous,'' says Dorfman. ''How much Gatorade will people have to drink for that much money to pay for itself? But I think what it says is that advertisers think the market is bottomless.'' ''More and more,'' says Lanktree, ''I don't know that there is a limit.''",0.106585450781,0.444405985319,1420 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"January 19, 1991, SATURDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",380 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;HERE ARE SOME tips on how to make sure your athletic shoes fit properly: (REST) Have both feet fitted while you are standing up.  Make sure there is about a quarter-inch, about half a thumb, between the end of your longest toe and the end of the shoe.&nbsp;The heel area should be snug with no slip. The heel should appear square when viewed from the rear. A tapered heel invites instability.  Pay particular attention to the width of the shoe. It should not be too snug, or feel sloppy.  Check the arch area for fit. Is the arch high enough? Too high?  Experienced fitters will check for pronation (foot rolls inward) and supination (foot rolls outward). Suggested for pronation areNike'sAir Anodyne and Asex Gel Epirus. Suggested for supinators are the Skylon model byNikeand the Saucony Azura.  Check for personal comfort. Some runners, for instance, like cushioning shoes. Others prefer to feel the ground. Athletic shoes are available that are designed to fit every customer's preference.  Ask about and try air-system fits. Also try less-expensive fits. Only you can decide which is best.",0.197407407407,0.54487654321,184 words,Reebok battles to regain top in image contest withNike,"January 22, 1991, TUESDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",381 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"''Image insurance'' isn't for everybody. But for companies launching products or ad campaigns centered on pro athletes, it's a hedge against the frailty of endorsers' personal reputations.Ted Dipple, president of Woburn, Mass.-based American Specialty Underwriters, says premiums for the new policies can cost 1% to 3% of the total revenues involved. Payoffs come if an athlete-endorser is involved in the ''commission of a criminal act, offense against public taste or decency, an occurrence tending to degrade, scorn or ridicule a large section of the community.''&nbsp;The new policies aren't big sellers, says Dipple, ''because not many companies know they're available.''&nbsp;HIGH TECH: This week,Nikebegins shooting its Super Bowl TV commercial - using Los Angeles as a backdrop.Nikewill project images of some of its famous athlete-endorsers such as John McEnroe on buildings - creating likenesses as tall as 17 stories.

"These days, when you see ads starring Leslie Nielsen, Paula Abdul, Isiah Thomas or Michael Jordan, you're seeing double. And triple. And even more.Those celebrities are part of an increasingly popular though highly controversial trend: Stars are being signed by a variety of national marketers to appear in two, three or more ad campaigns at once.&nbsp;Take Nielsen, for instance. The actor's career got a new lease on life in the 1980s after he turned to comedy. His ad career is reborn, too. In funny TV commercials, he plays off his riotous shtick as a deadpan doctor in Airplane! and as an off-the-mark police officer in The Naked Gun and a sequel opening June 28, The Naked Gun II 1.2: The Smell of Fear.Nielsen's first ad work, for Coors Light beer, has been airing since 1989. In January, he appeared as a clueless detective in ads for Diet Coke's ''Crack the code'' contest. And last week, Nielsen returned to the Tarmac in new ads for Dollar Rent A Car Systems Inc. themed, ''Right on the money. Right on the airport.''Already, Nielsen is ahead of multi-endorser Abdul, who is appearing in national ads for Diet Coke and L.A. Gear.Nielsen is close behind multi- endorser Thomas, who is featured in national ads for MTV, Minute Maid Orange Soda, Toyota and ASICS Corp. athletic shoes.Still, Nielsen has a long way to go to match the Chicago Bulls' Jordan. The basketball superstar now pitches for an astonishingly long list of blue- chip national marketers. Among them: McDonald's Corp., Coca-Cola Co., General Motors Corp. (Chevrolet), General Mills Inc. (Wheaties),NikeInc., Sara Lee Corp. (Hanes) and CBS/Fox Video.Multiple endorsements are lucrative for celebrities. Generally, a major marketer can pay anywhere from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 to lure a star into its ads. Other considerations can send the fees even higher: if the deal runs for several years or if the marketer wants the celebrity to make personal appearances at trade shows or dealer meetings.Yet few issues in advertising raise the hackles of industry critics more than the phenomenon of multi-endorser stars.The critics see red when the same short list of famous faces appears in ad after ad after ad. In recent years, that list has included Bill Cosby, Bo Jackson, John Madden and Willard Scott. Among newer additions: rock star Little Richard (Nike,Taco Bell) and rap star M.C. Hammer (Pepsi-Cola, Taco Bell and British Knights).The main complaint is that multiple exposure ''confuses the hell out of people,'' says George Lois, chairman of the Lois/GGK ad agency. The reason: The more ads a celebrity does, the less likely a consumer might be to recall the product being pitched in any one ad.Plus, there's a danger that multiple ads will ''make (the star) more famous than the product,'' Lois says. He should know - he admits that ''I like to think I use celebrities more than anyone in the history of advertising.'' Among Lois' star-filled campaigns are ads for Reebok Pump athletic shoes, MTV and USA TODAY featuring celebs like Scott, Boomer Esiason and Tip O'Neill.Anyone who stars in more than four simultaneous national campaigns has ''reached the saturation point. It begins to be a negative,'' says David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a clearinghouse for sports talent. ''I do see (advertisers) pulling back on some of these people who have that many commercials.''Yet those involved in signing celebrities to appear in multiple ad campaigns - as well as those who advise the celebrities to sign - say the practice is unavoidable.''There are a lot of celebrities. There are not a lot of Michael Jordans. There are not a lot of Leslie Nielsens,'' says Dan Fox, executive vice president of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, the ad agency that recommended signing Nielsen for the delightfully silly Coors Light campaign. As long as Nielsen's new Dollar Rent A Car ads ''use him to his best advantage, they will do nothing to diminish Leslie Nielsen'' as a Coors Light ad property, Fox says.Marketers and agencies insist using multi-endorsers is smart business. As evidence, they cite the extensive consumer research they do whenever considering whether to associate themselves with a star.''Ten years ago, endorsements may have been signed (with stars) because a top-level manager was a fan,'' says John Caponigro, president of Sports Management Network and the attorney for Detroit Pistons star Thomas. ''That doesn't happen anymore. Today, all the figuring out whether the celebrity appeals to the target audience is key.''Dollar's ad agency tested the idea of Nielsen as an ad star. The results: ''We found him instantly recognizable by the broad target group that rents cars,'' says Ray Roschmann, executive vice president of AC&amp;R Advertising Inc. ''And his persona, his type of humor, was very much a positive influence on the communication value of the commercial.''The crucial factor is ''the right use of the celebrity,'' says Manny Perez, executive vice president of the Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. ad agency. ''It works if he's there for a reason.'' Perez is using Magic Johnson in new ads for Kentucky Fried Chicken's skinless Light 'n Crispy line. The KFC ads follow the Los Angeles Lakers star's appearances in campaigns for other products such as Slice Mandarin Orange soft drinks and Converse athletic shoes.Still, marketers and their agencies are sensitive to charges that using multi-endorsers reveals them to be copycats trying to duplicate someone else's celebrity success story - and fraidy-cats, fearful of taking a chance on signing a celebrity who isn't already hawking other products.So steps are being taken to minimize the problems associated with multi- endorsers. Sometimes, star endorsers must agree to exclusivity clauses in their contracts, guaranteeing they will not peddle more products in other ads.The most common of these clauses call for what's known as category exclusivity. They require the star to agree to appear in ads for only one product type. For example, a fast-food chain might insist that its spokesstar not sign to do ads for a convenience-store chain that also sells food to go.In Nielsen's case, the strategy is to avoid having him appear in any ad as a spokesman or pitchstar. ''He's not saying, 'Go to Dollar Rent A Car' or 'Drink Coors Light,' '' says Curry Walls, president of the Sutter/Walls Associates talent agency and Nielsen's agent for ad endorsements.Instead, the idea is for Nielsen to play a character in his ads. Those advertisers who don't agree - and there have been many, Walls says - get turned down.And Caponigro's criterion in signing ad agreements for Thomas is not the quantity, but the quality.''You want to make sure, as he delivers the message, that it's consistent with his personality and his image,'' he says. ''As long as you do that, everything's all right.''",0.116443001443,0.465934143017,1149 words,"White Sox, Bo near deal;Nikesays news could come today","September 5, 1991, THURSDAY, FIVE STAR Edition",386 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Call it the sports world's equivalent of a Michael Jackson-Madonna showdown.The Lakers' Magic Johnson and Bulls' Michael Jordan aren't just playing for an NBA title.

''I like Magic,'' Lee has said, ''but (Johnson's Converse) ads suck.'' Advantage Jordan.&nbsp;- Clothes. Jordan has a line of formalwear - with casual clothes to come. But Johnson is spokesman for NBA Authentic gear, and his new NBA T-shirt line is already the sixth-biggest seller of league apparel - so Johnson even makes money on T-shirts with Jordan's likeness. Advantage Johnson.- Food. Both have blue-chippers - but Johnson owns a piece of a Pepsi bottling company. (FYI: Pepsi also owns Johnson endorsee KFC.) Jordan has a gum. But Johnson made a fast break into foreign food - a Spanish meat packer. Advantage Johnson.- Video. Johnson has a video game and home video. Jordan has a video game and two home videos, with his second approaching the record for sports videos. Jordan, along with Wayne Gretzky and Bo Jackson, will be in an NBC cartoon show, ProStars, this fall.

"Starting Monday, about 90,000 sporting goods retailers and manufacturers will congregate in Chicago to ask each other how new contraptions work, what consumers will want this fall and whether the recession is really over.But Ron Williams will ask very different questions at the National Sporting Goods Association trade show: How often does the industry hire blacks?''This industry, for whatever reason, has locked out blacks,'' says Williams, a San Antonio salesman for Wilson Sporting Goods and chairman of the Los Angeles-based Associaton of Black Sporting Goods Professionals. ''But we want to get away from hypotheses and get some data. I don't think anybody has done that - or been interested in the answers.''&nbsp;At next week's show, Williams will begin to canvass major manufacturers, thanks in part to a $ 15,000 grant fromNike,which is skipping the Chicago show. The ABSGP already has enlisted a research firm and drawn on the federal government's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Among the EEOC findings: Of managers in the sports equipment segment - excluding shoes and apparel - 2.28% are black.That's ironic, says Williams, given the industry's diverse consumer base - and could bring pressure from outside the business. A recent boycott ofNikeby Operation PUSH, a Chicago advocacy group, was largely ineffective. Now, says Williams, the industry can act before it's scrutizined by a group with a ''bigger magnifying glass.''Williams hopes the industry sees his group as ''a team player,'' and he's already getting cooperation.

"You're a pro athlete who knows your opponents' strengths and weaknesses from top to bottom. But do you know where you owe taxes?That's a question that's getting harder to answer, says Barry Klarberg, director of the sports and entertainment division of Deloitte and Touche, an accounting firm that works with many pro athletes. Already, he says, New York, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and the cities of Cleveland and Detroit are levying income taxes on visiting pro athletes, either for the number of days or games played in their jurisdiction. Some states already collect those taxes by automatic withholding.&nbsp;Klarberg says more states are getting into the act, as many as 15 in the next couple of years. ''It's a no-brainer for the states,'' he says, ''they just sit back and collect the money.''Players get credits in their home states, though that won't help athletes from states such as Florida, which has no income tax. And things could be worse, tax-wise, for athletes with U.S. teams: They could play on a pro team in Canada. There, the top tax rate is 42%, compared with the USA's 31%.&nbsp;RECOMMENDED READING: The Business of Professional Sports, a new book published by the University of Illinois Press, contains 13 essays on topics ranging from NFL players' salaries to ABC's Monday Night Football.

"ESPN tried an interesting experiment last Sunday night: value-added NFL game coverage.In case you missed it, don't adjust your sets this Sunday night. ESPN will continue the experiment during its Los Angeles Rams-Seattle game.The idea is simple: Give viewers a reason to stick with a blowout. With the Buffalo Bills leading the Indianapolis Colts 28-0 Sunday, ESPN devoted most of the third quarter to a pre-arranged interview, conducted by game announcers Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann, with ex-Chicago Bear Walter Payton, who was live from Chicago.&nbsp;Not that ESPN jettisoned the game. Although it occasionally devoted the full screen to Payton, he was seen mainly in a small portion of a split screen that featured game action.''This worked because we looked at it as an enhancement to the telecast,'' says ESPN vice president John Wildhack, ''I didn't think it was an intrusion.''Apparently not. Sunday, ESPN plans to try again: By satellite, Atlanta coach Jerry Glanville and Detroit coach Wayne Fontes will be guests.And why not? It will be a busy holiday weekend, and the game doesn't have playoff implications. And ESPN's 7.4 Sunday rating - putting its season- average 9.4 rating 14% lower than 1990 - can't be considered a conclusive lab test.Reactions to mixing banging helmets with talking heads:- ''I don't think what I saw (on ESPN Sunday) was unpalatable to viewers or to us,'' says the NFL's Val Pinchbeck. ''But, personally, it's very difficult to watch a game unless the game picture is of substantial size.''- Veteran NFL producer Mike Burks wonders if the format might distract announcers or prove annoying to diehard fans watching their hometown teams. ''Philosophically speaking, I think there's a great place for Walter Payton,'' he says. ''But I have a problem with it while a game's going on. ... Events needs to be treated with sanctity.''- ''It's very, very important to keep viewers watching,'' says Grey Advertising's Jon Mandel. ''If it works, more power to ESPN. If not, they should try something else.''- ''I enjoyed ESPN's cablecast,'' says NBC rookie NFL analyst Beasley Reece. But Reece says he won't need a sideshow when he announces Indianapolis- Tampa Bay Sunday. ''They're evenly matched. ... And anybody watching will either have a specific interest in the game or his TV set is broken and he can only get NBC.''&nbsp;CBS determines more of Olympics staffTime to settle all those office pools: CBS has named its announcers for the bobsled, luge, ski jumping and Nordic combined in the upcoming Winter Olympics.Lesley Visser and Sean McDonough, who have both covered the NFL and college basketball for the network, are among the more easily recognizable names. But some relative unknowns will get a chance. Luge analyst John Fee, for instance, is an ex-Olympian ready for his first TV job: Fee operates a salmon fishing business near Kodiak, Alaska.Or consider bobsled analyst John Morgan of Lake Placid, N.Y., who has covered previous Olympics for ABC. Morgan grew up in a family with six brothers and four sisters - and each was a bobsledder. Morgan's brother, Jimmy, a 1976 Olympian, died in a freak bobsled crash. ''Very few people,'' he says, ''can say they've seen as many sleds come down the track.''Well, not many people have the chance, because Lake Placid, N.Y., has the only bobsled track in the USA. Morgan suggests the USA's men's two-man team could finish in fifth to seventh place, with the four-man team placing as high as ninth. Team prospects would have been better, he says, if Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses, NFL player Willie Gault and ex-NFL player Greg Harrell had been allowed to compete - an issue that the trio is still contesting.But here's a viewer bonus: At the Olympics, 28 cameras will be used on bobsledding, double the number in 1988.&nbsp;Parcells might be out of hospital todayNBC says NFL studio analyst Bill Parcells is expected to be released today from Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J.

"NOT since Gussie Moran's lace pants outraged the purists and offended the establishment in 1949 has fashion been so prominent a topic of debate on the pre-Wimbledon hustings. Forget about the tennis, what will Andre Agassi wear on centre court or court 12 or wherever he makes his long-awaited return to the All England Club later this month? WillNike, his tailors, who have produced some unappetising blancmanges in recent months, risk the ultimate penalty of disqualification by being too colourful for the liking of the All England committee and the tournament referee, Alan Mills?Agassi, of course, is keeping quiet, which is not a word you can use about the purple and black outfit he has been sporting at the French Open. ''You've waited for three years to see, so I guess you can wait another few days,'' he said yesterday. Besides, he is exclusively contracted to reveal all to the readers of a tabloid newspaper. At the centre of the brouhaha is rule 8 of Wimbledon's ''Conditions of entry and participation'', which states: ''For all matches (except for the warm-up period) ... competitors must be dressed predominantly in white throughout. Any competitor dressed in a manner deemed unsuitable by the committee will be liable to be defaulted''. John McEnroe, one of the more notable victims of rule 8, had to change his dark blue shorts on centre court.&nbsp;No one can quite remember when the rule was actually set in stone, but Wimbledon is the only one of the four grand slam tournaments to have such a strict dress code. Philippe Chatrier, president of the French Tennis Federation and the International Tennis Federation, has talked wistfully about adopting the ''predominantly white'' rule for the French Open notably, in the aftermath of Agassi's pink-and-white number last year but has bowed to pressures of commerce.The manufacturers involved in the multi-million-pound leisurewear market are less enthusiastic about the tradition of the ''predominantly white'' ruling. ''What is ''predominantly white?'' asks Alfred Schwarz, head of sports promotions for adidas, who have Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf among the 50 or so players under contract. ''It's left to people's discretion. For the Wimbledon committee, that means nearly 100 per cent white, for us it means 51 per cent. We all agree you can't have solid blue, but a white background with some colour on it what's wrong with that?''Last year, the Italian clothing company, Diadora, which had guaranteed Jennifer Capriati $3.5 million for a five-year contract, badly misinterpreted the ruling and had its Capriati range turned down by the Committee of Management just before her Wimbledon debut last year. As Capriati, at the age of 14, was the youngest player ever to appear at Wimbledon and the media phenomenon of the year, that was a costly error, upsetting the trade, which had stocked up with the Capriati range on the understanding she would be wearing it at Wimbledon, and the public, who could not buy what they saw on television.''You want to be able to make stuff you can sell,'' Ian Hamilton, ofNike, said. ''One of the problems is that ''predominantly white'' does not sell and we can't keep producing clothes we cannot sell in the shops.''In practice, the manufacturers submit their designs to Wimbledon for informal approval, but the underlying issue, according to Schwarz, is that the Wimbledon committee is overstepping the boundaries of its authority. ''The ruling makes us nervous because we have to guess when we produce our ranges what will be acceptable to Wimbledon, but it is very difficult to get all the manufacturers together to lobby for a more precise definition,'' he said. ''From an image point of view, Wimbledon is the most watched event of any through the year. It has a certain meaning, but the design rule is a problem, and we feel that is our domain, not Wimbledon's''.Wimbledon argues that it is its job to protect the traditions of the championships. ''The rule is ill-defined, but we don't think it's right to stipulate any percentage for ''predominantly white''. A very small amount of psychedelic colouring can be off-putting while a pastel-coloured shirt could be perfectly acceptable. We feel and, I think, the players feel too that this is one of our better traditions,'' Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, said.Privately, of course,Nikeknows a good marketing ploy when it sees one. The company will not reveal how much it has spent on the design and promotion of its No.1 clothes horse any more than it will reveal the colours of his outfit to the Wimbledon committee. Rumours abound. Agassi in classical white from top of his head to the bottom of his white bicycle shorts? Agassi with dyed white hair?

"&nbsp;Right off the bat, I feel that I should say there have been times when I wondered what Bud Collins was doing on TV.Like the time he interviewed Billie Jean King after one of her many victories at Wimbledon and dubbed her &quot;St. Billie Jean of Centre Court.&quot;It was classic Collins, fawning humor that too often makes him seem like more of a fan than a journalist. But that weakness is also Collins's strength. He loves tennis and that love shows through on his work with NBC at major events like the French Open and Wimbledon.&nbsp;When Collins joins Dick Enberg in the broadcast booth for today's women's final between Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini (9 a.m., NBC, CTV, RDS), he will be working on his 20th Wimbledon final. He was relegated to the minor role of roving reporter at last year's tournament when NBC wanted to give more time to broadcasting neophyte Jimmy Connors. NBC brought Collins back into the booth this year because they felt that presentation was better with him and his encyclopedic knowledge of the sport.It's not an opinion shared by everyone. A few months after Collins took over as editor of World Tennis magazine, a poll conducted by the magazine showed that 40 per cent of the respondents felt Collins was the worst commentator on TV. With typical good humor, Collins said he hoped that there weren't many NBC executives in that group.Collins has played tennis all his life and was good enough to win a U.S. national indoor mixed doubles title - &quot;I had a good partner,&quot; he explained. While working as a sports writer at the Boston Globe, he moonlighted as the tennis coach at Brandeis University. His captain was Abbie Hoffman, who made headlines in another type of court when he was one of the defendants in the Chicago 7 which grew out of anti-Vietnam War protests during the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago.It was Collins who first broached the idea of &quot;Breakfast at Wimbledon&quot; by insisting that the event was important enough to be televised live. If you miss some sleep this weekend to catch the action, Collins is the guy to blame.&quot;The first year (1979) was nearly a disaster,&quot; recalled Collins. &quot;We were hoping for (Bjorn) Borg against (John) McEnroe or (Jimmy) Connors and instead we got Borg against Roscoe Tanner. But it turned out to be a great match and nobody thinks about not doing the final live.&quot;Over the years, Collins has become a familiar figure at Wimbledon and he can usually count on exchanging a few words with royalty. But his first encounter with the royals was a near disaster.Ignorant of protocol which calls for a member of the royal family to initiate a conversation, Collins once pushed a miscrophone in front of the Duchess of Kent. He was politely, but firmly, pushed away by Wimbledon security.When the Duchess saw Collins the following year, they exchanged nods and the year after that, the Duchess said: &quot;Nice to see you.&quot;When she said, &quot;Nice to see you again&quot; the next year, Collins related the incident on TV and said with a suggestive wag of his eyebrows: &quot;Things are heating up, I think the Duke is getting worried.&quot;NIKETO UNVEIL NEW SPOTBaseball's annual All-Star game is at the SkyDome Tuesday night and the highlight of the telecast (8 p.m., CBS, CTV, Quatre- Saisons) is certain to be the return of Bo Jackson.No, he won't be playing in the outfield. But the two-sport star will be showing some nifty moves in the latestNikecommercial, a splashy musical number with a chorus line and a full orchestra. In the middle of the commercial, Jackson excuses himself and says he doesn't have time for this nonsense because he has to rehabilitate his injured hip. That's when the king of the comebacks, heavyweight boxer George Foreman, steps in.Future commercials will offer other pretenders to Bo's throne, including Wayne Gretzky of the L.A. Kings. In a promotional video to announce the new commercials, Gretzky says he has no desire to further his acting career.

"&nbsp;Drop your tennis whites.Traditional court wear is being shoved aside for the wildest tennis fashions in decades.Say hello to bright neons and bold jewel tones.&quot;Fifteen years ago, whites were white but that's no longer the case,&quot; said Charles Zimmerman, customer service supervisor for Adidas Canada.&nbsp;Tennis wear is now anything but predictable. Traditional tennis skirts now come with lycra shorts sewn inside. Or forget the skirt. Lycra shorts are hip alone or under white tennis shorts.Or ditch the white shorts. Tennis shorts now come in an array of denim. There's washed denim, distressed denim in black, and various hues of blue.Bland tennis shirts have had an image boost. Many come with zippers and in neon patterns. Narrow cuts have been loosened up and some shirts comewith a tail at the back.The biggest swing has been the shift away from white. Industry leaders likeNikehave added Persian violet, clear turquoise, hot lime and neon teal to their summer collections. Fall pushes the swing further with tennis blacks holding centre court, said Ruth Heaven, national apparel manager forNikeCanada.&quot;There's a move to the extreme since black has never been on the court before,&quot; said Heaven. &quot;Black has always been the number one body color and outsells all other colors.

"&nbsp;THEY ARE the unsavory types you would not want around your children. If these guys came to dinner, chances are you would count the silverware upon their departure.So why are some of the nasty boys of professional sports getting five-figure contracts to try to sell you on what deodorant you should put under your arms?Hulk Hogan, recently implicated as a customer in a steroid distribution case, endorses Right Guard deodorant. So does Charles Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers forward who spit on a girl at courtside and threw water on another fan last season.&nbsp;The Right Guard triumvirate is rounded out by Brian Bosworth, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker whose mouth turned out to be larger than his talent and who is best remembered for being suspended from the Orange Bowl while playing for the University of Oklahoma after a positive steroid test.So why would Gillette, the maker of Right Guard, spend money on these guys?&quot;We are playing off their bad boy image,&quot; says a spokesperson for N.W. Ayer, the New York ad agency that designed the ads. &quot;It's the way the campaign is supposed to work.&quot;&quot;Brian's a bad boy, and I do think that sells,&quot; says Gary Wichard, Bosworth's agent.So, in the topsy-turvy parlance of advertising, bad becomes good.&quot;To a certain degree, anybody is marketable,&quot; says David Falk, vice-chairman at Pro Serv Inc., a Washington, D.C. firm that represents a host of athletes, including the Atlanta Hawks' Dominique Wilkins. &quot;But I've got to believe that the last five to 10 years there has been an increased awareness of behavior, off-court and on-court.&quot;To that end, most advertisers now include morals clauses in contracts with athletes. Overstep the moral bounds and you are out.But what are the bounds?&quot;You have to look at it on an athlete-by-athlete basis,&quot; says Bob Dorfman, a copywriter with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising in San Francisco. &quot;With something like the Right Guard campaign, the right idea can overcome a lot of bad personality aspects.&quot;Dorfman points to theNikeshoe commercial that ran after Barkley had his run-ins with the NBA and was heavily fined. In the commercial, David Robinson, the clean-imaged centre for the San Antonio Spurs and anotherNikeendorser, asks Barkley, &quot;Can you spell fine, Charles?&quot;Still, there is a line.&quot;For example, I don't think you could get by with making fun of (Philadelphia Phillies outfielder) Lenny Dykstra's drunken driving charge,&quot; Dorfman says.Athletics tie-ins with products is nothing new. Yankees catcher Yogi Berra said, &quot;Me-hay for Yoo-Hoo. Fudge bars too-who&quot; back in the 1950s. And the prize fights on Friday night television were the Gillette Friday Night Fights.Today that connection is stronger than ever. Products from soft drinks to motor oil to headache powder to automobiles to wrist watches are being pitched by everyone from fastballer Nolan Ryan to race driver Richard Petty to tennis player Gabriela Sabatini.And while Sabatini and Steffi Graf, both tennis players, rank among the top 10 athletes for outside endorsements internationally, it is largely a man's game in the United States.&quot;Tennis and golf both have international appeal,&quot; says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott and Margulies, an identity consulting firm. &quot;But in the U.S. the hottest market right now are the men who play team sports, particularly players in the NBA.&quot;In the wider U.S. market, women (athletes) have a much more limited appeal as far as endorsements are concerned. Except for women who play tennis, nobody is all that interested in having a pair of shoes just because Monica Seles wears the same kind.&quot;So lucrative are commercial endorsements that some highly paid athletes make more from their endorsement contracts than from the salaries their teams pay them.Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls capped an NBA championship and a Most Valuable Player Award with a new endorsement contract. Gatorade is paying Jordan a reported $ 19 million over 10 years to try and get people to drink its product. Before setting that all-time high, Jordan'sNikecontract went undisclosed but advertising executives suspect it was the single largest endorsement deal ever.All told, Jordan's endorsement income alone has been estimated at $ 10 to $ 15 million yearly. His salary is $ 2.1 million annually.&quot;Michael transcends everything,&quot; says Chajet &quot;His image has redefined marketing.&quot;Arnold Palmer, a leader on the endorsement list long after he dropped from the top of golf tournament leader boards, has pulled in at least $ 5 million annually in endorsement contracts over the last decade.Jordan's image is of a squeaky clean, nice guy. And Palmer's image is of common man perfection.&quot;It is more than just athletic accomplishment that makes someone a sought-after endorser,&quot; says Nova Lanktree, executive director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago. &quot;There has got to be personality and a sense of acceptance of the person.&quot;DESPITE THE limited success of Bosworth and Hogan, other athletes have not been able to exploit off-the-field endorsements because their image is suspect. Two examples mentioned by advertising executives are former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco.Canseco became the first baseball player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a single season. But he also has had several run-ins with the law, including a charge of carrying a weapon while on probation for multiple traffic offences. And after being a no-show at numerous public appearances, Canseco started his own call-in line so fans could hear his side of the story.Tyson, who is scheduled to be tried for rape on Jan. 20, seems to cause even more consternation, though it took a rib injury to postpone his Nov. 8 championship fight with heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.&quot;Tyson is the most unpredictable athlete out there,&quot; Dorfman says. &quot;He's scary . . . you have to have some pleasantness about you.&quot;A lack of &quot;pleasantness&quot; has hit Tyson in the pocketbook. In 1988 Pepsi agreed to pay him about $ 1 million to push its products, but the contract was not renewed in the wake of allegations by Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, that he physically abused her.&quot;There are only so many dollars out there for the credible athletes,&quot; says Atlanta attorney Bruce Church, who represents former Brave Dale Murphy. &quot;The involvement costs are too high to gamble with. The cost not only of getting the athlete involved but getting the message out in front of the public.&quot;&quot;It inherently holds that when you hitch your product image to a star, there is some degree of risk,&quot; Chajet says.To most, the line is distinct: Lawbreakers are taboo.&quot;On a very literal basis, when it starts to get into the area of legality and criminality, then it starts to backfire,&quot; says Lanktree. &quot;Barkley is a kind of naughty boy but he is not seen as a bad person. And I think that in view of Hulk's previous clean reputation, he's going to be all right.&quot;Lanktree contrasts Hogan's alleged use of steroids with that of sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his world and Olympic records after testing positive.Though Johnson did not have many lucrative endorsement contracts, the setting of the world sprint record could have opened up international possibilities for him, Lanktree says.&quot;Ben Johnson took prescription drugs,&quot; she says. &quot;What he did was not illegal, but he totally lost all his value (as a spokesperson).&quot;He was seen in the beginning as someone who was difficult, unapproachable. He was never likeable and his lapse into illegality cinched it.&quot;Baseball's all-star balloting, where the fans elect the starters, is a barometer of an athlete's standing in his community, Lanktree says.She notes that in 1990 Wade Boggs was voted by fans to start the All-Star Game despite a well-publicized extramarital affair.&quot;Whatever Boggs's attitude was, he was not seen by the people of Boston as saying, 'Screw you. I don't care what you think,' &quot; she says. &quot;On the other hand, Canseco was not elected to the All-Star team. I think that was very significant.&quot;Everyone agrees the future will see more athletes endorsing products.",0.0843508554937,0.440560502989,1383 words,Nike'sprint ads,"April 3, 1991, Wednesday, FINAL EDITION",402 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Variety is the spice of life, and art in Vancouver this year was a visual smorgasbord of mammoth proportions.My regular beat covers 40 galleries. Just over half of them are public institutions and centres run by artists or non-profit associations. The rest are commercial galleries with strong exhibition programs. Between them, they staged over 500 exhibitions.&nbsp;After a while, you become familiar with the orientation of particular galleries and know, in general, what the fare will be. It becomes rather like deciding where to dine out.Long-standing commercial galleries present work by their major artists every year. This means you can count on learning what Jack Shadbolt, Gordon Smith, Al Neil, Toni Onley and Attila Richard Lukacs have been up to on a regular basis.You can also expect work by major Canadian and international contemporaries at almost all the public urban and suburban galleries and art by lesser-known or emerging artists at the Pitt, Smash, Grunt and Fifty-Six. Shows of a scholarly nature, on the other hand, are most likely to be displayed at the Vancouver Art Gallery and at the museums.As with restaurants, the art at some places is invariably better prepared and more exciting than at others. And, in some instances, the fact that the exhibition menu will vary (or hasn't settled into a pattern yet) makes for continued interest.It's always the element of the unexpected (a surprise, a thing of outstanding quality) that keeps the juices running.And in the current climate of recession and increasing competition for ever-decreasing funding, it's impossible not to admire the commitment and professionalism of the multitude of people who help make Vancouver one of Canada's most vital art centres - the equivalent to a fine buffet in a sophisticated restaurant.*Here are my top picks of 1991:Curator of the Year: Liane Davison, Surrey Art Gallery (13750 88th Avenue), for staging exhibitions characterized by intelligence and heart that make going to Surrey an essential trip for all who take contemporary art seriously.They ranged from Ian Thomas' moving presentation of the diminished world of aging parents in Swallow Meadows rest home last February to Alan Storey's current 10-year retrospective that includes beautifully crafted models of his major public installations.The community-involving conceptual art show, The Presence of Absence, was the first of its kind in B.C. The entire gallery staff helped 100 volunteers create and install artworks according to the instructions of 13 international artists.Entrepreneurs of the Year: lithographers Torrey Groening and Nigel Harrison, for encouraging major local artists to create fine art prints with them at Prior Editions.Doug Biden's colorful biomorphic abstractions, Carel Moiseiwitsch's phallic bombers and her current tribute to theNikeof Samothrace, Neil Wedman's neo-Victorian fantasies and David Ostrem's pop politics are themes explored in the lithographic suites these artists made and showed in the attractive atelier-cum-gallery at 1028 Hamilton.Architect of the Year: Paul Merrick, for his exquisite Canadian Craft Museum at Cathedral Place and the stone-arched cloister courtyard in front of it.From the Burrard Street perspective, the museum appears to hover above the rushing cascades of Park Place Plaza. Its pinnacled, reliquary-like form is an ornate counterbalance to the dour late 19th-century church next to it.That the Canadian Craft Museum's exhibition program is establishing Vancouver ever more firmly on the map as a major art and craft centre is another reason for choosing the institution as one of 1991's best things. At the moment, Finnish artist Oiva Toikka's glass is there for your viewing pleasure.*But these were by no means all that were praiseworthy this year.* At North Vancouver's Presentation House, director/curator Karen Love and assistant curator Diane Evans staged a fine cycle of exhibitions of contemporary art photography, always thoroughly researched and sensitively presented.* Richmond Art Gallery gets a doff of the hat for sustaining its exhibition program in temporary premises - an old supermarket shared with the library at 5951 No. Three Road - until a new building opens next fall.Richard Tetrault's Island Processions (until Jan. 6) is typical of the small, intensive displays of new work by B.C. artists that are central to the gallery's program.* Other outstanding exhibitions in 1991: Carole Itter, Luke Blackstone and Al Neil's Where the Streets Are Paved With Gold; Past/Future/Tense and Sara Diamond's Paternity (all at the Vancouver Art Gallery); Philippe Raphanel's Lip Synch and Recent Work (Or and Tech Galleries); Annette Messager (Contemporary Art Gallery and Presentation House); The Masque of the Red Death installation (Grunt Gallery); Michelle Normoyle's Hero (Artspeak); Kelly Wood's Lurch (The Front); Neo-Nativists (The Pitt); George Rammell (Charles H. Scott); Correy Wyngaarden's multi-media installation (University of B.C. Fine Arts Gallery); Public Domain (Contemporary Art Gallery); and Robin Peck (Burnaby Art Gallery).*The commercial galleries also contributed immensely to the flavor of the past year's art feast.Diane Farris recently expanded her already important stable by adding fresh local talents - Chris Woods, Lionel Doucette, Gu Xiong and Sam Lam among them.Patrick Doheny's gallery recently embraced Carrol Pantages, Margaret Bootsma and Melissa Crenshaw. Rich Neilson, Wayne Edmondson, Lesley Finlayson and the current exhibitor, Lorne Greenberg, are four new names at Catriona Jeffries.The Smash and Gallery Fifty-Six also staged challenging programs and introduced the Vancouver public to many new faces.Heffel Gallery's recent show and catalogue of W.P. Weston's work contributed to public awareness of a major (and neglected) B.C. painter. The Smash's ManWoman 20-year retrospective was the first major survey of this Cranbrook artist's oeuvre in Vancouver.The Equinox's XX Century Photography exhibition offered an outstanding selection of photographic images.More often than in 1990, in fact, shows at the commercial galleries have been of museum quality or of scholarly interest.",0.152512751275,0.397577834707,1047 words,Nike'sprint ads,"April 15, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",403 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD _ Last year, Will Smith was just this charming, wise-acre kid from Philadelphia who'd had a couple of rap hits and seemed like promising grist for TV's celebrity mill.Now that Fresh Prince of Bell Air is a solid hit, the network executives have learned why Smith's teachers in West Philly dubbed him &quot;The Prince.&quot; Will Smith, six-foot-2, 198 pounds and as slick as the slash on aNikesneaker, plays grist for no one's mill.While admitting he was overawed by the medium at first, the 22-year-old star now speaks articulately about how he wants the show to develop, where he is taking his career, and how to deal with network politics.&nbsp;Smith's perspective is fresh off the Philadelphia pavement.For him, the behind-the-scenes machinations of television _ what he calls &quot;posse politics&quot; _ is like a pick-up basketball game.&quot;When you watch television, you feel like it's this great monster, that there's a million geniuses at work putting this incredible project together.  And then I found out when I got into the business everyone's not a genius; they just understand what's going on,&quot; Smith said in an interview.&quot;When you come on a show, you want to bring your friends, It's posse politics.  On the basketball court, if you want to play ball, you want to play with your friends.&quot;The same things you would go through, the same arguments and everything on the basketball court to make sure you're friends play with you, that's the same things you do in the meetings when you argue about whose going to be the writers, whose going to be the stage directors and all that stuff.  And I just thought, I know how to do this!&quot;Yes he does.  His girlfriend from Philadelphia works in wardrobe for the show.  A buddy from back home with no previous experience is one of the writers on the series.  Smith's personal manager is an associate producer.&quot;I got my squad going on,&quot; he says with satisfaction.  He admits it's nice to have their support, but their presence means much more than that.  It says he's a player.He's just as determined about other aspects of his career.  He has his eye on films, but he's already ruled out comedies.  He has declined lucrative endorsement offers from Coke, Pepsi, Cannon, andNike, because it might undermine his film chances.Ditto, animation.  There will, he promises, be no Fresh Prince cartoon show.Smith doesn't see himself as just a rapper, or even a rapper with a hit TV show.  He started his own record production company this summer; he wants to get into stand-up comedy (he had his debut recently in a Salute to Michael Jordan, as tribute taped for U.S.  cable TV); he wants to write.&quot;I want to have a lot of slashes after my name.&quot;He got a taste of dramatic acting this summer with a small part in a yet-to-be-released feature film called Where The Day Takes You.  Smith plays a wheelchair-bound double-amputee in a story about homeless kids on Hollywood Boulevard.But his chief concern is still the series.  He's excited by changes that he says will give the characters more credibility.&quot;You have to get a feeling that life is going on, that these people are not just showing up and making jokes.  You have to feel like before 8 o'clock you missed something and after 8:30 you're mad because they're about to say something else that was just as funny but you're missing it because you're only allowed to step into your lives between 8 and 8:30.&quot;But in a network sitcom, reality only goes so far.  He speaks, with some regret, about a potentially controversial storyline that was rejected for the coming season.&quot;There was an episode pitched where a girl told me she was pregnant, and the episode was about me deciding what is the right thing...  I think that's very realistic because at the point that episode came on, there would be half a million kids struggling with the same thing.&quot;Smith hopes that such shows will be possible in the future, once the producers have time to develop the characters.  He has strong feeling about the facets of his character that have been left unexplored.&quot;(He) is extremely heterosexual, He needs to explore those issues.  This is character whose definitely having sex.  He's 17, and he's definitely having sex.&quot;He points out that in the coming season even squeaky clean boy genius Doogie Howser over on ABC is getting intimate on screen.  &quot;Before me, man!&quot; he says with mock offense.",0.142945326279,0.487955614345,1047 words,Nike'sprint ads,"April 30, 1991, Tuesday, FINAL EDITION",404 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Nike'smain stylemonger pitchmen -- Michael Jordan and Andre Agassi -- are going in opposite directions. (No, I didn't forget Bo Jackson. But at the moment all Bo knows is surgery. Just Glue It.)Jordan is soaring up.Agassi is choking up.This seemed like a pivotal year for both men. At 28, Jordan was approaching the peak of his power. If he didn't win an NBA title with this solid supporting cast, folks would start wondering whether he ever would.&nbsp;At 21, Agassi was still a few years away from his zenith. But historically, the great tennis players bag a Grand Slam early. Bjorn Borg took the French at 18, and the first of his five Wimbledons at 20. John McEnroe won the U.S. Open at 20. Jimmy Connors harvested Wimbledon at 21. Many of Agassi's peers grabbed Grand Slams at tender ages: Boris Becker was a wunderkind, 17, when he claimed his first Wimbledon; Stefan Edberg won the Australian at 19; star-crossed Mats Wilander, who has since dropped off the face of the earth, took the French and the Australian at 18. Tennis isn't a patient game. It isn't fine wine aging in oak barrels.It looks like Jordan's time has come. He's celebrating an electric playoff, averaging nearly 32 points and 12 assists a game in the finals. And fortunately for him, he hasn't had to beat the Lakers alone. There's always the tendency to cast Jordan as Superman, playing one against five. But in the last three games his teammates have distinguished themselves, particularly Horace Grant and John Paxson, who've shot 65 percent in the Bulls' victories.Jordan is an especially popular cultural icon, perceived as the Right Kind of Person, one of spectacular gifts and admirable humility. Though Jordan has at times elevated himself beyond his teammates -- by referring to them as &quot;my supporting cast&quot; -- he isn't begrudged. Everyone recognizes Jordan's magnificence, and roots for him. Were he not to win this championship, or in fact, any other, he wouldn't be blamed. Like Ernie Banks, Jordan would be viewed with a sympathy that would glow warmer over the years. Because Jordan, although unequalled as a stylist, is seen as having profound substance.This is not the case with the Agassi, who is perceived as the Wrong Kind of Person, one of tenuous gifts and surpassing ego. In tennis, Agassi's style is nearly as distinct as Jordan's is in basketball. But he gives the impression of disingenuousness. Look at their most famous commercials: Jordan is a foil for Spike Lee in theNikeads, self-effacing and charming; that he would be friends with such a wanna-be as Mars Blackmon accentuates Jordan's sweet accessibility. In contrast, Agassi has that Canon commercial, where he crassly calls attention to himself, and in the ultimate declaration of a lack of substance, he vulgarly recites, &quot;Image is everything.&quot;Live by the line, die by the line. At the moment, Agassi's image is worse than Byron Scott's. &quot;Never On Sunday&quot; Agassi has reached the final of his last three Grand Slam tournaments and lost them all -- the 1990 French, the 1990 U.S. Open and the 1991 French. Every time Agassi went in ranked significantly higher than his opponent, each of whom was in his first Grand Slam final.Okay, you may excuse Agassi's loss to aging Andres Gomez last year in Paris by pointing out it was Agassi's first time in a Grand Slam final too. You may excuse Agassi's straight-set pasting by Pete Sampras in New York by saying Sampras's big game is tailored for hard courts. But how do you excuse losing in Paris again -- on clay, Agassi's best surface -- to chippy Jim Courier, who never got into the quarters of a Grand Slam before? Typical of Agassi, he gave back a big lead, and lost in five sets. Agassi is notorious both for losing on Sunday, and losing in five. &quot;A five-setter is just about guts,&quot; Courier said afterwards. So what does that say about Agassi?Jordan can lay it off on his teammates. What's Agassi supposed to say, the line judge had a bad day? Agassi's a swell player, extremely entertaining, hits the ball 1,000 miles an hour, and the fans love him. But so far all he's done in tennis is make the world safe for accessories. His earrings, his outfits and his stubble have made more noise than his game. He's a pampered poodle who now has to face this annoying fact: Although Agassi is the second-highest ranked American -- but probably the best -- younger countrymen Courier, Sampras and Michael Chang all have won Grand Slams. Agassi hasn't. At this rate Jimbo's son Brett-bo will win one before Andre.Wimbledon seems out of the question this year. Agassi has boycotted the world's No. 1 tournament since 1988, allowing people to believe this silliness that wearing all-white offends him. He has a better chance at the U.S. Open. But it's easy to imagine Agassi being shaky in the final.Taking heart, Agassi may be able to draw a parallel to Ivan Lendl, who wore a similar choke label until he was 24. Lendl booted four Grand Slam finals in a row before breaking through in Paris in 1984. Since then he's won seven more. He and Agassi play the same kind of hard forehand game from the baseline. The difference is in temperament. Lendl became a champion when he realized the game could humble him. Once he scorned the grass at Wimbledon. Now, even though he's won the French three times, he skips it to concentrate on preparing for Wimbledon -- the one title to elude him. That kind of humility would serve Agassi well, much better than those stupid day-glo outfits.",0.157749948464,0.477288188002,919 words,Nike'sprint ads,"May 13, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",406 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"The scene that provided the most touching memory of the 1991 NBA Finals came a few minutes after the victorious Chicago Bulls had danced into their locker room in the Great Western Forum. In the middle of a typically raucous champagne celebration sat Michael Jordan, his arms caressing the championship trophy.An NBC camera was there too as Jordan, flanked by his father James and his wife Juanita, embraced the trophy the way a first-time father would his newborn child. &quot;Where's Michael? Where's Michael?&quot; the normally unflappable Bob Costas shrieked as he searched for the series MVP. By the time Costas finally found him for a quickie interview, it was almost anticlimactic. No words -- just the picture -- were necessary, shortly after midnight, when the real Michael Jordan finally appeared on national television.&nbsp;Not the Michael Jordan of the commercial breaks who soared to the moon to grab a Coke, not the Michael Jordan pitching the worst hamburger ever made (McDonald's McLean, a fat-free piece of cardboard masquerading as chopped meat), not the Michael Jordan in the genie's magic lamp. Not even the Michael Jordan -- doyaknow, doyaknow, doyaknow -- who's not going to Disney World unless all his teammates are invited.No, this picture was the real deal, a magnificent athlete in solemn celebration after achieving his life's goal, a man who never again will have to hear himself compared to Ernie Banks of the Cubs, another Chicago legend who never won a championship.NBC spent more wasted time on history to set the scene for Wednesday night's final game. They built a story line about the Bulls' teams of the early 1970s with Bobby Love, Norm Sloan and Norm Van Lier and their frustration in being eliminated in the playoffs by the Lakers for three straight years. Van Lier even showed up at halftime as NBC pounded away on the same theme -- that the Bulls of 1991 would finally vindicate those talented teams of the past. But that was then and this was now, and if you think Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen or any of the other Bulls were playing this game for anyone but themselves, think again.Still, once the hype ended and the games began, NBC distinguished itself in its first year of NBA coverage. Marv Albert has no peer as a basketball play-by-play man, always calm, even when Dyan Cannon pecked him on the cheek at the start of the second half and wished him a happy birthday. And analyst Mike Fratello, particularly in the final two games, learned to modulate his voice from shrill to shrewd and cogent observations on strategy and game trends.NBC did us all a favor by limiting the role of its sideline reporters, though Steve Jones hardly distinguished himself. At a critical juncture in the fourth quarter, just as the Lakers had taken a one-point lead, he pointed out the crowd was singing &quot;I Love L.A.,&quot; a kiss of death for the Lakers in games past. As it turned out, he was right, but the only sweet music that buried the Lakers was the whistling woosh of the net every time John Paxson tossed up one of his lethal long-range shots.Sideline reporters are useless unless they can actually provide instant updates on key injuries, changing strategies or significant trends, not the claptrap of inane interviews with players' parents and wives, Hollywood celebs, or cliche-cluttered coach interviews at halftime.NBC might be wise next season to steal a page from CBS's NBA coverage -- stick a microphone and a hand-held camera into huddles during timeouts to get the real story as coaches diagram plays and set their defenses. Come to think of it, though, almost every timeout during this series was immediately followed by an endless stream of ads, most of them featuring bikinis, spandex and beer in one variation or another andNikes,Nikes,Nikes. By now, there isn't a basketball fan alive who doesn't know that Commissioner Stern gives lousy birthday presents to former Naval officers. Mr. Robinson, keep the day job.But Stern could care less, not after he takes a look at the ratings the final series achieved. Wednesday night's game had a 19.7 rating and 36 audience share, the second highest rated NBA game in history, trailing only a 21.2 and 37 share for Game 7 between the Lakers and Pistons in the 1988 finals. It also drew the highest ratings for games 2, 3 and 5 in NBA history, and the average viewing audience of 43.6 million for each of the games also was an NBA record. As NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol said, &quot;The only disappointment is that we could only imagine where we could have gone with the sixth and seventh games.&quot;A seven-game series would have added a few million more to the network's coffers, but Ebersol could take consolation in knowing that the NBA on NBC -- a $ 600 million package over four years -- turned a profit at a time when many network sports divisions are taking a recession-induced beating.&quot;The ratings were like the good old days,&quot; Ebersol said yesterday. The network was praying for this ballyhooed matchup of Michael Jordan vs. Magic Johnson. But Ebersol said he believed it was actually interest in Jordan's quest for his first NBA title that began building during the sweep of Detroit added to the drama and swelled the viewership.&quot;We didn't really have a finger on it right away,&quot; he said, &quot;but as each day went by over the last three weeks, I think people saw a transcendent moment for Jordan as the Bulls began to beat the Lakers. The most visible superstar in all of American sports was reaching his goal, and the public got caught up in that.&quot;And when he finally got there, NBC, much to its credit, was there to share Michael Jordan's glorious moment.",0.0680010465725,0.477708006279,946 words,Nike'sprint ads,"May 24, 1991, Friday, FINAL EDITION",407 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"-- A short time after winning back its status as the seat of reunited Germany's government, Berlin has welcomed the return of a powerful symbol of the country's glorious and aggressive history.Nike, the goddess of victory, her chariot and its four horses were remounted last week atop the city's Brandenburg Gate amid cheers for a return to normalcy and protests that the statue glorifies Germany's aggressive and nationalistic past.The one-ton, 197-year-old goddess had been removed for repairs after a rowdy New Year's Eve crowd damaged the statue a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But the goddess returns with a different look: For the first time since it was removed by East Germany's Communist government in the 1950s,Nikeholds a standard topped by an Iron Cross and the Prussian eagle.&nbsp;The cross and eagle were added to the statue in 1814 to celebrate a Prussian victory over Napoleonic France.German parliament member Friedbert Pflueger, leader of a group of young conservative legislators who had fought to keep the government in Bonn to symbolize Germany's commitment to the West, denounced the placement of the country's highest war decoration, the Iron Cross, on the gate.&quot;I doubt whether we will be understood above all by the younger generation and abroad if we crown the Brandenburg Gate with this symbol,&quot; Pflueger said. &quot;The Prussian eagle and the Iron Cross can be admired in a museum.&quot;The leftist Berlin daily newspaper TAZ expressed its contempt by printing a prominent photograph of the rear of one of the goddess's horses.Alliance 90, the East German grass-roots movement that spawned anti-Communist demonstrations in 1989, called the decision to display the Iron Cross &quot;an anachronism&quot; and a sign of the &quot;Prussian-German nationalism that led the European continent more than once in the last 200 years to catastrophe.&quot;But the Berlin city government defended the $ 300,000 restoration and the return of the Prussian symbols, calling them a proper and proud part of German history.

If Sony Corp. were designing cellular phone fashions, you could be sure the phones could be worn a' la the Walkman, not just something you carried around in your pocket. The challenge here isn't just clever engineering; it's captivating design. It's figuring out what the best design metaphor should be.Computers by Cardin? Interfaces by Armani? Ralph Lauren's Casual Multimedia Look for Men? Why not? Clothes blend function with fashion. So do those state-of-the-art digital watches. We should be able to wear our computers and television sets as comfortably and casually as we wear our watches.Maybe high-bandwidth antennae will be woven into our jackets and touch-sensitive panels could be stitched into our sleeves as we choose to make our media fit us instead of the other way around. The goal is not to recreate Maxwell Smart's shoe phone -- it's to offer a media wardrobe that's tailored to our media style. People already pay a premium for Waterman and Mark Cross pens -- ink-based media that offer far more fashion than function. So why wouldn't they pay a premium for a wardrobe that delivered far more bang for the buck?Look at the athletic shoe business.NikeInc. and Reebok International Ltd. have succeeded precisely because they've figured out how to meld the lust of fashion with the need for performance. Their shoes are loaded with &quot;innovative technologies&quot; such as pumps and gels. These companies don't make shoes; they create lifestyle technologies. Why shouldn't a telephone or a computer be designed with that idea in mind? Maybe Motorola and Sony have a lot more in common withNikeand the high-tech shoe companies than they now realize.Today, nobody thinks twice at the sight of an executive in a $ 3,000 suit wearing a Sony Walkman or screaming into his or her BMW's car phone. Perhaps it will seem just as natural for someone to sketch a digital diagram on his or her IBM/Apple software sleeve to have it uploaded into an office file by cellular modem. Perhaps power Ray Bans will be equipped with the projection device made by Reflection Technologies that gives the eye the illusion that a computer screen is hovering but a foot away. Maybe Nintendo will offer a jacket-with-a-joystick that lets you play games if you slip a cartridge in your sleeve. My gosh, if we can have Coca-Cola Co. clothes, why not have a line of digitized Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. mensware that lets you resonate with the frequency spectrum or catch &quot;Casablanca&quot; as you're standing in line?The reality is that people already have personal media woven into the fabric of their lives. How much of a leap is it to weave that technology into the fabric of their clothes?Indeed, why shouldn't the well-tailored media wardrobe -- permitting easy computational management of integrated sound, text and imagery -- become just as common as today's double-breasted suit? The folks of the future who don't wear a phone or a computer in public may seem as vulgar or poorly dressed as people who don't wear ties or whose favorite textile is polyester. Instead of &quot;All dressed up and no place to go,&quot; tomorrow's lament will be &quot;All dressed up and no data to process.&quot;It's far too early to anticipate the differences between haute media couture and the off-the-rack, ready-to-wear media wardrobes that will be selling at K mart. On the other hand, it's not at all early for the Motorolas and Sonys to start chatting with the Givenchys and Ralph Laurens.Sure, people are interested in tools and functionality. But our media are as much a reflection of our desired lifestyles as anything else. Relentlessly smaller phones miss the point. So do smaller computers and electronic planners.Is Motorola in the &quot;portable telephone&quot; business? Or is it really in the business of creating new fashions for personal communications? Will the Motorolas, Sonys and Matsushitas make devices we use to communicate and calculate? Or will they also design the media wardrobes we wear? My bet is that the media wardrobe companies will be those that make a real killing in the business of pop culture.Michael Schrage is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.",0.153750726885,0.522926493076,914 words,Nike'sprint ads,"July 11, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",410 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"IN THE BEGINNING, there were Loehmann's, the Williamsburg Pottery Factory and Pennsylvania.When I came to Washington 15 years ago, those were the main places to shop discount. Loehmann's was open late one night a week, and never on Sunday. Friends organized killer, day-long expeditions to Williamsburg for dried flowers, loads of Pyrex and Mexican trinkets. Only the really serious joined charter bus trips to the Pennsylvania hinterlands for raincoats and lingerie.Today, Washington seems at the epicenter of discountland, with nearby Potomac Mills crowding out Virginia's historic landmarks as the state's No. 1 tourist attraction, and roads to the beach or the mountains strewn with factory stores.&nbsp;Since I'm not the all-day browser type, having neither the fiscal nor physical wherewithal, I've developed a more strategic approach to ferreting out bargains.Many of the big-name outlets -- Anne Klein, Bali-L'Eggs-Hanes, American Tourister, Carter's, Bass,Nike,for example -- have stores in each of the three main shopping areas: Potomac Mills, the Eastern Shore and Martinsburg, W. Va. It's the shops unique to each locale that determine the direction I head.My biggest weakness is for china. I think it must be in the genes, since both my sisters are similarly afflicted. All of us can always find just a little more shelf space for, say, a dozen dinner plates, or another pair of candlesticks. So, all things being equal, I head east on Route 50 where Mikasa, Royal Doulton, Dansk, Carvel Hall and Gorham all beckon with bargains.This trip can be tedious at best during summer months, when everyone is rushing at breakneck speed toward Rehoboth and Ocean City. But the pace is more relaxed in the off-season, and all the new road construction is finally paying off.First is Mikasa (in the Bay Bridge Market Place, one mile west of the Bay Bridge), a cavernous showroom packed with shimmering crystal goblets, deeply etched crystal bowls, formal china, frivolous crockery, beer mugs, chip-and-dip servers and massive Italian pottery. It's almost too much to comprehend.My favorite place is literally the back room, where odd pieces and leftovers are stacked in bins and on steel shelves, and the prices drop as low as $ 1 a dish. I long ago acquired more dishes than I could ever need, but still I seek out groups of, say, 10 dinner plates or salad plates to mix and match with the china I already own. This is the place to find it.Next door is Royal Doulton, where the selection is more attuned to the regular patterns carried by department stores, only at cheaper prices. But this is also the place to look for the collector figurines this English china maker is famous for. And last time I visited, there were even Royal Crown Derby crabs in imari style -- bold blues and reds with elaborate gold details -- at half the (very expensive) normal price.Two other stores in this discount shopping strip attract me: the Ribbon Outlet and the Paper Factory. Both are good places to stock up on wrapping supplies.Proceeding over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, my next stop is the Dansk outlet, on Route 50, just after Route 301 branches off toward Delaware. This outlet was here 15 years ago, too, but then it had mostly upgraded plastic and rustic platters instead of the flowered china, faceted crystal and Southwestern-style dinnerware of today.Again, my favorite area is the markdown section just behind the cash registers, where I once found odd-sized cups and saucers marked down to $ 1.25 a set.Carvel Hall, next door to Dansk, features the company's famous cutlery, as well as a wide selection of quality European crystal accessories and silverplated trays and bowls.The Chesapeake Village shopping outlet, a few hundred feet past Dansk on the opposite side of Route 50, is the latest alluring string of factory stores to settle on the Eastern Shore. High-quality clothes are the specialty here, with large outposts selling Liz Claiborne, Gitano, Evan Picone, Jones New York and Geoffrey Beene.The most intriquing shop is the He-Ro store, where you'll find smashing cocktail dresses and ball gowns to rival those at any chic boutique. And there's also a 9West shoe outlet.Tucked amongst these sirens is the Gorham store, stacked to the ceiling with fine serving pieces that make stunning gifts.I save the Kent Narrows Factory Stores for my return trip. These stores have been hard hit by the years-long bridge construction that obscured the exits. Several tenants have been lured to the newer Chesapeake Village, but the recent opening of a Bugle Boy jeans store here promises to revitalize the center.This is also the place to find Corning products, small electric gadgets, Pfaltzgraff and Izod stores. And it's the home of Carter's, a one-stop heaven for baby and children's clothes, from inexpensive diaper shirts to tiny Baby Dior jumpers to frilly party dresses and sturdy jeans.While an excursion to the Eastern Shore takes up a big chunk of any weekend day, Potomac Mills is close enough to Washington to offer the possibility of weeknight shopping.The tales of this place are legion -- the lines at the Guess outlet, the steals at the Macy's and Nordstrom's centers. But I hit Waccamaw, for inexpensive clear glass dishes, and then head to Fitz and Floyd and the Limoges outlet.Even the marked-down prices at Fitz and Floyd are pretty steep, and likewise at Limoges. Limoges's great secrets are the unmarked white &quot;blanks&quot; of dinner plates and soup bowls that, when in stock, go for under $ 5 each.To my mind, West Virginia is for clothes, and with headliners such as Ralph Lauren Polo, Calvin Klein, Benetton and London Fog, who thinks about dishes? This is the most pleasant of nearby shopping trips, a two-hour drive through the Virginia countryside culminating at the renovated red-brick buildings that comprise the Blue Ridge Outlet Center, just off Route 9 in Martinsburg.Compared with the mammoth Potomac Mills, the outlet center is bright, compact and an ingenius way of recycling the sturdy former woolen mills. Further along Route 9, the Martinsburg Factory Stores offers Oshkosh B-Gosh children's clothes and Reebok/Rockport shoes among its outlets.Even with this bounty nearby, lately I've been plotting to go to Williamsburg again. The allure this time? The Lenox factory store. BAY BRIDGE MARKET PLACE --U.S. 50 in Annapolis, one mile west of the Bay Bridge. 24 stores, including Mikasa, Bass and Royal Doulton.

"The Los Angeles Raiders said yesterday running back Bo Jackson failed a team physical this week, and doctors think Jackson won't be able to play professional football again.Raiders executive assistant Al Locasale said in a telephone interview that team physicians were &quot;not optimistic&quot; that Jackson, who played baseball for the Chicago White Sox this year, could rehabilitate his injured hip and return to football.&quot;Our doctors don't think he will be able to play football again,&quot; Locasale said. &quot;His doctor [James Andrews] thinks he might be able to return in 1992. But we don't see that happening.&quot;&nbsp;This week, the NFL lost for the season and maybe forever two of its biggest superstars: Jackson and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.&quot;I hate to see this league lose a guy like that,&quot; New Orleans Saints President/General Manager Jim Finks said about Montana. &quot;That hurts us.&quot;The loss of the two stars hurts a lot of people. Besides fans, it affects the pocketbooks of advertisers and network executives.On Wednesday, Montana had elbow surgery to repair tendon damage. It was his eighth surgery in a 13-year pro career. Montana had elbow surgery in 1981 and 1989, back surgery in 1986 (thought at the time to be career-threatening), arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in 1983 and 1989, arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder in 1986, and surgery to repair a broken right hand in January 1991.All of that time spent on the operating table -- and the fact that he will be 36 years old next season -- leads to speculation that Montana will not be able to return.Michael Dillingham, who performed the surgery on Montana, said yesterday that the operation was successful and expressed cautious optimism that Montana, a future Hall of Fame player, will be able to return. Dillingham said that during the 90-minute operation Montana's tendon was reattached to the bone in his elbow.The doctor would not put any specifics on Montana's recovery period, but told reporters at a news conference, &quot;There's a good chance he'll return to play.&quot;However, a doctor who recently examined Montana told the Associated Press that Montana also has an unstable and weakened shoulder that might unhinge his comeback.NFL adversaries have learned never to count him out, though.&quot;I haven't seen any quarterback do what Joe has done and that is bring a club back,&quot; Finks said. &quot;He would never concede. We had him by the throat a couple of times and he got away.&quot;Jackson, who is in the final year of a five-year, $ 7.4 million contract with the Raiders, automatically received a $ 100,000 reporting bonus for taking the physical and is scheduled to get $ 416,000 in deferred signing bonuses, according to the sources. Jackson also could get an estimated $ 4 million from a disability insurance policy.Jackson injured a hip in a football playoff game last season. During his comeback with the White Sox, it was apparent that Jackson was without much of his speed and he ran the bases with a limp because of degenerative cartilage in his hip.Off the field, advertisers are trying to gauge the popularity of the injured stars and how well they may be able to sell their products.Jackson -- famous for his &quot;Bo knows&quot; commercials -- had a tremendous impact onNikeprofits, according to Liz Dolan, the company's vice president of corporate communications.Raiders defensive lineman Howie Long was the original endorser of theNikecross training shoes from 1987 to 1988, then was replaced by Jackson in late 1988. In the three years since, sales of cross training shoes went &quot;literally from zero to over $ 300 million,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;Bo was a great way for us to communicate what cross training means.&quot;Asked if Jackson's absence could hurtNike'ssales, Dolan said: &quot;Well, he's getting less exposure, so who really knows. But even when he's getting less exposure, he's getting more than most athletes.&quot;Network executives seemed almost scared to discuss the impact a season without Montana and Jackson would have on ratings.&quot;I think the NFL might lose some viewers,&quot; said ESPN football analyst Joe Theismann, the former Redskins star. &quot;But people will also be curious to see how teams do without Montana and Jackson.&quot;",0.108868937185,0.373489265836,708 words,Nike'sprint ads,"August 22, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",412 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet smell of success may soon have new meaning for business.Dr. Alan Hirsch, a Chicago neurological researcher, believes pleasant scents beget dollars and cents; both through increased worker productivity and by altering consumers' tastes.His most recent study indicates smells have a powerful effect on customers and their buying habits.&nbsp;&quot;Odors will be the Muzak of the 1990s,&quot; Hirsch says. &quot;We'll soon see more of a total sensory approach to marketing.&quot;Hirsch, a professor at the University of Illinois and director of the privately run Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation Ltd., recently found that 84 per cent of people in a study group liked a product more when they were sitting in a room with a lightly mixed floral odor.Participants examined the product,Nikerunning shoes, in two separate rooms at different times, Hirsch says. One room was florally scented and the other was odor-free.They were asked to rate the shoes on several factors. The shoes seen in the scented room received more favorable ratings.&quot;It didn't matter which room they went into first. The results showed a positive response in the odorized room,&quot; Hirsch says.Nikeshoes were chosen because running shoes don't elicit an emotional response at the time of purchase, like products such as greeting cards or automobiles, Hirsch says.The results of the study of 31 people can be extrapolated to the population in general, he says.The study also found subliminal effects, Hirsch says. People who didn't even notice the floral scent also preferred the shoes when in that room.&quot;I do not endorse the use of subliminal smells,&quot; Hirsch says. &quot;To me it is like subliminal advertising at the movies and I don't think it is fair.&quot;He worries that scents can be exploited by unscrupulous marketers. For instance, a car dealer may use subliminal lavender odor to make the consumer feel more relaxed and trusting of sales people.The impact of smell is also greater on women than on men, and on non-smokers than smokers, he says.Jim Dion, of John C. Williams Consultants, a firm that monitors retail trends, says smell is the &quot;last frontier&quot; for marketing.&quot;We know the look and the feel of a product has an effect on the buyer,&quot; says Dion, who holds an industrial psychology degree. &quot;And the perfume companies have been working on the smell aspect for years.&quot;But whether smell has an effect on buying clothing or records or whatever . . . well, there just hasn't been enough research. My hunch is there is something to it.&quot;In Japan, a company has gone further by developing a computerized system that can spray fragrances through buildings. Shimazo Co. has found mint smells make production line workers feel livelier.Japan is years ahead of North America in smell technology, Hirsch says. There is an alarm clock in Japan that sprays peppy scents, such as rose blossoms, 10 minutes before the person is to wake.The potential use for smells can extend to lowering anxiety of airline passengers and hospital patients to increasing productivity of white- and blue-collar workers, he says.Hirsch's current study, funded by a Japanese firm, tests the effect of smells on people working with computer terminals.",0.165888047138,0.469444444444,544 words,Nike'sprint ads,"September 19, 1991, Thursday, FINAL EDITION",413 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cincinnati Reds manager Lou Piniella lost patience with his players yesterday, suggesting in a profanity-filled tirade that they stop worrying about themselves and start thinking more about the team. Piniella erupted following an 8-4 victory over Montreal that left Cincinnati six games behind Los Angeles in the NL West. A question about reliever Randy Myers set Piniella off. Myers said this weekend that he doesn't think the Reds will keep him as a setup man for Rob Dibble, now the No. 1 closer, and he predicted he'll be traded back to the New York Mets. Myers got the victory yesterday by pitching out of a sixth-inning jam. &quot;For a guy who traded himself to the Mets two days ago, he did a good job,&quot; Piniella said. Moments later, Piniella was yelling. &quot;You can talk about trades and 'I'm going here or here.' First of all, you don't even know if the organization you want to go to wants you,&quot; Piniella said. &quot;So let's quit with all this shenanigans and just play baseball. I'm tired of hearing it, I really am. I'm sick and tired of it.&quot;&nbsp;Double A in Hamilton? A recent report had the Class A Redbirds ready to fly out of Hamilton. Could be, but only if the Steel City gets what it wants - a Double A expansion team in 1994, Redbirds president Rob Hilliard said yesterday. The team has been looking at alternative sites in case a move is necessary in '94. The search is compounded by the fact that the Class A New-York Penn League is looking at expansion itself, Hilliard added. The Redbirds have a stadium lease through '92 and have asked for an extension for '93.Royal thumping: The Toronto Maple Leafs ran their record to 13-3, tops in the Intercounty Major Baseball League, with a 12-1 thumping of the Guelph Royals yesterday at Christie Pits. The Leafs, who pounded out 13 hits including a grand slam by Jim Wojcik, sent a dozen batters to the plate in an eight-run first-inning uprising. Marty Cerny (4-0), got the win for the Leafs with six innings of two-hit ball.Mitchell's back: The San Francisco Giants have activated outfielder Kevin Mitchell and sent outfielder Rick Parker to Triple A Phoenix. Mitchell went on the 15-day disabled list on June 3, then had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two days later.He's heard the rumor: White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf had heard the rumor. No, he said,Nikein no way is underwriting Bo Jackson's Sox contract. The whisper was that if Jackson didn't make it,Nike- which has a promotional interest in the injured outfielder being perceived as an active player - would put up half Jackson's $700,000 1991 guarantee. &quot;The commissioner even asked me about that,&quot; Reinsdorf said. &quot;I don't even know why the commissioner would care. &quot;But it's just not true.&quot;Ignore standings in June? Yes and no, Oakland manager Tony La Russa says. &quot;Over the years, I've always had conversations with guys about what turns you on,&quot; La Russa said. &quot;I've talked to real good pros who like to grind, grind, grind and they look up at the standings on Sept. 1. Other real good pros look before then and get a real charge out of seeing the club at the top of the standings. I've always enjoyed being in first place. It's a matter of whatever personally gets you going. For me personally, being in first gets me going.&quot;Japan tops the U.S.: Hiroyasu Ito's three-run homer in a four-run seventh inning led Japan to a 10-8 victory over the United States yesterday in Game 2 of the 20th Collegiate baseball championship series at Tokyo. Japan leads the best-of-five series 2-0.It's taking its toll: Paul Assenmacher doesn't want a vacation, mind you. But a day off might not be such a bad thing. The Cubs' workhorse reliever came into the weekend second in the league with 38 appearances. He's on pace to pitch in a staggering 95 games, or 21 more than his career high, set last season. Part of Assenmacher's problem is that he's so strong against lefties that a manager just can't resist the temptation to call on him. But lately all the work is taking its toll; Assenmacher has allowed at least a run in his last four outings. Still, Assenmacher's not the type to complain. &quot;I'm not worried about getting my rest,&quot; he said.Quote of the week: Cincinnati's Rob Dibble claims he's trying to control his often wild behavior. &quot;I've been clean for the last few weeks,&quot; Dibble said. &quot;I'm on the wagon. I've done things in anger, but I haven't done it on the field, so nobody knows about it. I've learned to channel my frustration better.

No, he said,Nikein no way is underwriting Bo Jackson's Sox contract. The whisper was that if Jackson didn't make it,Nike- which has a promotional interest in the injured outfielder being perceived as an active player - would put up half Jackson's $ 700,000 1991 guarantee. &quot;The commissioner even asked me about that,&quot; Reinsdorf said. &quot;I don't even know why the commissioner would care. &quot;But it's just not true.&quot;Ignore standings in June? Yes and no, Oakland manager Tony La Russa says. &quot;Over the years, I've always had conversations with guys about what turns you on,&quot; La Russa said. &quot;I've talked to real good pros who like to grind, grind, grind and they look up at the standings on Sept. 1. Other real good pros look before then and get a real charge out of seeing the club at the top of the standings. I've always enjoyed being in first place. It's a matter of whatever personally gets you going. For me personally, being in first gets me going.&quot;Japan tops the U.S.: Hiroyasu Ito's three-run homer in a four-run seventh inning led Japan to a 10-8 victory over the United States yesterday in Game 2 of the 20th Collegiate baseball championship series at Tokyo. Japan leads the best-of-five series 2-0.It's taking its toll: Paul Assenmacher doesn't want a vacation, mind you. But a day off might not be such a bad thing. The Cubs' workhorse reliever came into the weekend second in the league with 38 appearances. He's on pace to pitch in a staggering 95 games, or 21 more than his career high, set last season. Part of Assenmacher's problem is that he's so strong against lefties that a manager just can't resist the temptation to call on him. But lately all the work is taking its toll; Assenmacher has allowed at least a run in his last four outings. Still, Assenmacher's not the type to complain. &quot;I'm not worried about getting my rest,&quot; he said.Quote of the week: Cincinnati's Rob Dibble claims he's trying to control his often wild behavior. &quot;I've been clean for the last few weeks,&quot; Dibble said. &quot;I'm on the wagon. I've done things in anger, but I haven't done it on the field, so nobody knows about it. I've learned to channel my frustration better. If I'm ticked off about something now, I go out and run until I'm so tired I just want to go home and sleep.&quot;",0.0787858262427,0.411092327213,769 words,Nike'sprint ads,"July 6, 1991, Saturday, FINAL EDITION",416 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK - Second-seeded Monica Seles is a cold-blooded killer on the tennis court, pumping balls with her two-fisted strokes like a gunman blasting a machine gun at a helpless target.Just ask Gigi Fernandez, the unseeded U.S. doubles ace who yesterday found herself on the receiving end of a 6-1, 6-2 Seles thumping in the U.S. Open quarterfinals.There was little to rehash about a match which lasted 53 minutes, so Seles offered her thoughts on a number of subjects. When reporters asked how Seles could champion equal prize money for such unmemorable fare - losing quarterfinalists at the Open, men and women, pocket $51,900 - Seles waded right in.&nbsp;&quot;I think (on) average, if you look, there would be more interesting matches in women's draw at the thournament,' she blithely announced.Then breezily consigning thrillers such as Jimmy Connors' miraculous comeback from 2-5 down in the fifth to defeat Aaron Krickstein as &quot;the exceptions . . . the bonuses,&quot; Seles added: &quot;I don't think you go by quality. I think a lot of times when you watch men's tennis and they go five sets, you are up to here with them.&quot; She illustrated by brushing her hand across her forehead.&quot;If they make the equal prize money (everywhere) it's not going to be that much of a difference to us when you're earning at this level,&quot; continued Seles, whose official pre-U.S. Open prize money was just less than $3 million.&quot;I just like the principle of being equal. I think it's a much better feeling when you are going out on the court and you feel equal. Because, you know, the women's level of the game is there. I mean, look at just the serves.&quot;For the record, the average speed of Seles' first serve yesterday was 73 m.p.h. The average speed of the men's serves who competed on the stadium court where there is a radar gun is about 108 m.p.h. The fastest male serve clocked is 126 m.p.h. by Wimbledon champ Michael Stich. The fastest woman is American Debbie Graham at 105 m.p.h.Last week, after her 6-2, 6-0 first-round destruction of American Nicole Arendt, she volunteered that she'd like to ape Andre Agassi (andNike)and bring a new look to tennis clothes. To this end, she said she'd faxed three or four of her ideas to Fila, the Italian designer whose Monica Seles line of clothes she's paid to wear on court. When she'd had no response to her fax, she phoned, only to discover everyone was on holiday for a month.What Seles envisions is something less unconventional than Agassi's Just Do It line fromNike:something sophisticated in keeping with Fila's image; fun but adventuresome.Just what she meant by adventuresome was the subject of hot discussion after CBS-TV cameramen shooting her match with Czechoslovak Regina Rajchrtova told other media that when Seles served it looked as if she were &quot;mooning&quot; the crowd.There were already pictures shot during an earlier match showing Seles wore no bra. Had she stopped wearing panties as well? Or was she wearing one of those new high-cut numbers that look like an athletic version of a G-string?Turns out all the subsequent talk was just cheeky speculation. Courtside photographers report Seles wore ordinary white tennis panties while she blitzed Fernandez.Gray power: Be sure to look closely when Jimmy (the Miracle Worker) Connors plays Holland's Paul Haarhuis tomorrow night - especially if the television shows a recap of the 39-year-old, five-time U.S. Open champ's stellar career.What you'll discover is that not only is Jimbo trying to turn back the hands of time on court, but he's also dying the tattletale gray from his body-permed hair.Poor delivery: Despite having signed a large contract, reputed to be between $750,000 and $1 million a year, right after Wimbledon with the Yamaha racket manufacturing company, Gabriela Sabatini, the defending women's champion, is not playing with the new wide-bodied model.In Toronto, where she defaulted in the semifinals with a blister, many noticed that her never-that-trustworthy serve had zero pop and that even her trademark top-spin groundies lacked their usual fizz.Seems Yamaha has yet to come up with a racket that plays like the Prince graphite, the racket Sabatini grew up using.Too low-profile: An interesting discovery is that Michael Stich, after winning what's billed as the most prestigious tournament on earth - Wimbledon - has not been inundated with offers to endorse everything under the sun. While he says that his Swiss management agency is sorting though proposals, the fact remains that Stich has not signed a single contract.Canadian wins: Stephanie Tibbets, the last of the seven Canadian girls in the junior U.S. Open, won her opening-round match, upsetting Japan's Mamie Donoshiro, the No. 13 seed, 6-0, 2-6, 6-4.

The 3-day package, Dec. 29 to Jan. 1, offers the same features for $203.At this writing, there are still a few places left for New Year's.The winter mid-week special (four weekdays for the price of three) will run you $183.What's the catch?Until this season, the resort, which is just four years old, has stayed closed for the winter. This year, however, Tapatoo has installed a spa, banquet and conference facilities, and is luring its first winter guests with these and other introductory seasonal rates.Resort Tapatoo, situated on 70 acres of woodland, is owned by a German-Canadian couple, Guenter and Christa Siebert, and designed in the style of a Black Forest farmhouse. With only six hotel rooms, six suites and 12 cottages, all with lake views, the atmosphere is one of home-like intimacy. All rooms have telephones, televisions, four-piece bathrooms, king size or double beds, and pine furniture.The suites and cottages also have wood-burning fireplaces.What is there to do in winter up in God's country, besides eat, sleep and languish in a hot tub contemplating the folly of city life?Tapatoo's assistant manager, Kathrin Saar-Liesenfeld, says the region's snowmobile and cross-country skiing trails are excellent, and skating on Otter Lake is a popular activity.In the evening, guests get together in the German-style pub/bar in the main lodge. Frequently, there is live entertainment on weekends.On Saturday, Dec. 28, the Moosalm Trio from Austria will be giving a special performance. Between Jan. 16 and 19, Parry Sound's Snowfest '92 celebration is expected to attract up to 3,000 snowmobilers to the area. On Feb. 15, Tapatoo is throwing a Valentine's Day dance, and on Feb. 29, the resort's winter carnival bash will feature the theme &quot;From the Rhine to Rio.&quot;Resort Tapatoo is a two-hour drive from Toronto, and special winter prices are in effect through March, 1992.

Music for the event will be performed by the Orillia Consort, the Jubilee Chorale and the Bellringers from St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Orillia, and singer/guitarist Marg Raynor from Midland.Various demonstrations, exhibitions and games have also been planned, including candle dipping, porcelain painting, decorative woodburning and quill pen writing.The Moon of Wintertime celebration is scheduled between 1:00 and 4:30. Admission is $4 for adults, $3.50 for children, and $3 each for groups of more than 10. For information, call (705) 526-7838.* * *Bar stool babies?  There is a pub in Ickford town that's called the Rising Sun. . . and some people have noticed a correlation between a certain bar stool therein and a sharp increase in the local birth rate.According to a recent Reuter report, 32 women in this village in southern England claim to have conceived after sitting on the three-foot-high plain oak stool.But trust the medical profession to debunk the logical cause-and-effect conclusion that the stool has magical powers. Ickford's doctor, Ken Burche, theorizes that the baby boom can be attributed to an influx of young couples into the area.* * * HaveNike,will travel: There's an update on theNikesneaker story which appeared in this column last summer. As some of you may recall, a cargo ship en route from South Korea to Seattle lost five boxcar-size containers full of sneaks. A year later, to the unbounded delight of the locals, the shoes began washing up on beaches along Oregon's north coast.The 80,000Nikes,as it turns out, are the largest number of man-made drift objects ever to be dropped in one place in the northern Pacific. Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, recognizing a unique research opportunity, has plotted the landfalls of sneakers from Oregon's south coast to the Queen Charlotte Islands.The results of his studies into ocean currents may be valuable in predicting routes of oil and sewage spills.* * *Beehive bed-and-shower: Airline transit passengers on long-haul journeys know how miserable airport stopovers can be. Exhausted and unkempt, you long for a shower, a nap and a little peace and quiet to fortify yourself for the next leg of the trip.If your stopover happens to be at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, you're in luck. Not long ago, a Japanese-style beehive hotel called Cocoon opened to provide respite for transit passengers.The 60 air-conditioned cubicles each contain a bed (single or double), table, telephone, TV, clock, closet and shower room with toilet and wash basin. Single rooms cost about $50, doubles about $60, and stays of up to 16 hours are permitted.For an extra charge, travellers may use a fax machine, portable computer, and the services of a trilingual secretary.For information, contact Cocoon, Roissy 1 Terminal, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. The local reservations number is 48 62 16 16.* * *Roughing it in the bush: Hiker Walter Roden, 64, recently lost his way in the San Gabriel Mountains, about 32 km north of downtown Los Angeles. Did he welcome the chance to test his survival skills in a real-life emergency? You bet he did.Roden reached into his backpack, pulled out a cellular telephone, and called his wife to let her know he'd be late. She in turn called the U.S. Forest Service, which then deployed a search-and-rescue team.* * *Fast food sweep: If the goulash proves too spicy, visitors to Hungary will soon be able to fall back on that North American standard, Kentucky Fried Chicken. A Budapest-based company has signed an agreement to open 22 Colonel Sanders outlets in Hungary during the next seven years, with the first expected in downtown Budapest early next year. The deal follows in the footsteps of McDonald's, which opened a Budapest outlet in 1989 and was an instant hit.",0.081175752542,0.399840179201,1195 words,Nike'sprint ads,"December 28, 1991, Saturday, 1* EDITION",421 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

For reservations or information, phone (705) 378-2208 or toll-free at (800) 461-5410.* * * Midland Moon of Wintertime:Tomorrow, a special celebration of music and history will be held at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, the recreated 17th century Jesuit mission near Midland.The Christmas carol &quot;Twas in the Moon of Wintertime,&quot; which has been attributed to Jesuit father Jean de Brebeuf, will be performed. Music for the event will be performed by the Orillia Consort, the Jubilee Chorale and the Bellringers from St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Orillia, and singer/guitarist Marg Raynor from Midland.Various demonstrations, exhibitions and games have also been planned, including candle dipping, porcelain painting, decorative woodburning and quill pen writing.The Moon of Wintertime celebration is scheduled between 1:00 and 4:30. Admission is $ 4 for adults, $ 3.50 for children, and $ 3 each for groups of more than 10. For information, call (705) 526-7838.* * *Bar stool babies? There is a pub in Ickford town that's called the Rising Sun. . . and some people have noticed a correlation between a certain bar stool therein and a sharp increase in the local birth rate.According to a recent Reuter report, 32 women in this village in southern England claim to have conceived after sitting on the three-foot-high plain oak stool.But trust the medical profession to debunk the logical causeand-effect conclusion that the stool has magical powers. Ickford's doctor, Ken Burche, theorizes that the baby boom can be attributed to an influx of young couples into the area.* * * HaveNike,will travel: There's an update on theNikesneaker story which appeared in this column last summer. As some of you may recall, a cargo ship en route from South Korea to Seattle lost five boxcar-size containers full of sneaks. A year later, to the unbounded delight of the locals, the shoes began washing up on beaches along Oregon's north coast.The 80,000Nikes,as it turns out, are the largest number of man-made drift objects ever to be dropped in one place in the northern Pacific. Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, recognizing a unique research opportunity, has plotted the landfalls of sneakers from Oregon's south coast to the Queen Charlotte Islands.The results of his studies into ocean currents may be valuable in predicting routes of oil and sewage spills.* * *Beehive bed-and-shower: Airline transit passengers on long-haul journeys know how miserable airport stopovers can be. Exhausted and unkempt, you long for a shower, a nap and a little peace and quiet to fortify yourself for the next leg of the trip.If your stopover happens to be at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, you're in luck. Not long ago, a Japanese-style beehive hotel called Cocoon opened to provide respite for transit passengers.The 60 air-conditioned cubicles each contain a bed (single or double), table, telephone, TV, clock, closet and shower room with toilet and wash basin. Single rooms cost about $ 50, doubles about $ 60, and stays of up to 16 hours are permitted.For an extra charge, travellers may use a fax machine, portable computer, and the services of a trilingual secretary.For information, contact Cocoon, Roissy 1 Terminal, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. The local reservations number is 48 62 16 16.* * *Roughing it in the bush: Hiker Walter Roden, 64, recently lost his way in the San Gabriel Mountains, about 32 km north of downtown Los Angeles. Did he welcome the chance to test his survival skills in a real-life emergency? You bet he did.Roden reached into his backpack, pulled out a cellular telephone, and called his wife to let her know he'd be late. She in turn called the U.S. Forest Service, which then deployed a search-and-rescue team.* * *Fast food sweep: If the goulash proves too spicy, visitors to Hungary will soon be able to fall back on that North American standard, Kentucky Fried Chicken. A Budapest-based company has signed an agreement to open 22 Colonel Sanders outlets in Hungary during the next seven years, with the first expected in downtown Budapest early next year. The deal follows in the footsteps of McDonald's, which opened a Budapest outlet in 1989 and was an instant hit.",0.081175752542,0.399840179201,1191 words,Nike'sprint ads,"July 30, 1991, Tuesday, FINAL EDITION",422 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

It's not scholarships or funding for libraries that bothers the centre. Fast-food firms, for instance, are getting into the schools (and the minds of impressionable buyers) by running such things as reading programs with restaurant coupons as incentives.When corporations call the shots, Jacobson warns, they also control the messages: touting their goals, their interests.&quot;We have to examine how much of our lives are oriented around buying products and socializing in malls, as compared to being involved with community activities, our families and hobbies,&quot; he says.It's especially appropriate at this time of year, he suggests, to look at how much of our giving is going to those truly in need. The average person faces hundreds of commercial messages each day.

We spend, spend, spend so we can save.Entire magazines are developed and designed to sell products under the pretence of helping us feel better about ourselves. Meanwhile, we dig ourselves deeper into debt.Then there are the blurred sales pitches designed to look like news and information, the &quot;advertorials&quot;.Jacobson says we've become so used to living with ads we hardly notice the commercial censorship that's going on. It's the messages we don't get that can also be harmful. (How many public service ads have you seen promoting nutrition and civic mindedness? Then count the number of toy, cereal and restaurant ads you've seen of late.)Not only does commercialism drain our wallets, Jacobson says, it creates an insatiable appetite for more and fosters feelings of envy, anxiety and insecurity. We're not just buying a product - we're buying the belief that we'll be more attractive, live longer, have more friends . . .&quot;There are very powerful forces telling us that buying should be our preoccupation, that we should spend our lives shopping,&quot; he says.Jean Kilbourne, a lecturer and an adviser to the commercialism centre, in her film Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women, summed up the power of advertising this way:&quot;Advertising is one of the most powerful socializing forces in the culture. And the effects are as inescapable as the effects of pollution in the air . . . Ads sell more than products. They sell images, values, goals, concepts of who we are and who we should be . . . They shape our attitudes and our attitudes shape our behavior.&quot;The centre advocates:* Boosting the cost of sending junk mail.* Banning junk telephone calls and advertising aimed at children.* Eliminating corporate promotions in schools.* Creating public service messages encouraging people to consume less, to be skeptical of advertising claims and to spend TV-free days.* Developing curricula on commercialism and media literacy for high school students.* Increased public support for civic organizations and museums.In its first year, the centre hotly criticized Washington's Smithsonian Institution for &quot;plugging products and companies&quot; and asked it to &quot;reverse the decisions that allow corporations to invade its facilities.&quot;&quot;Kids will leave (the Smithsonian) tugging at a parent's shirt sleeve, begging for Lego bricks and Batman paraphernalia,&quot; says Jacobson of one exhibit. &quot;And why not?

To make matters worse, the exhibition is sponsored by Coca-Cola and titled to reflect that. The inescapable conclusion is that the ROM has been fully co-opted by a soft-drink manufacturer.&quot;Jacobson says the ROM has sold a part of its soul for an exhibit Torontonians could well have lived without.&quot;Children will have the name Coca-Cola even more firmly established in their minds. And it will be associated not with tooth decay and obesity and the term junk food, but with the prestige of the museum.&quot;For more information, write the Centre for the Study of Commercialism, 1875 Connecticut Ave. N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20009-5728.",0.117340132693,0.44869585125,1412 words,Nike'sprint ads,"April 6, 1991, Saturday, Final Edition",423 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"In all the commotion over Bo Jackson's future as an athlete, it should be remembered that he defied what happened to happen. And it did.Midway through the 1987 baseball season, the Kansas City Royals outfielder decided that he would also join the Los Angeles Raiders as a running back -- Jim Thorpe inNikecommercials. When he glibly described playing pro football as a &quot;hobby,&quot; he was reminded that stamp collecting is a hobby, that being mauled by linebackers is not a hobby, that a serious football injury could diminish, if not jeopardize, his baseball career. But like so many other gifted athletes who consider themselves to be indestructible, Bo knows insistence.&nbsp;&quot;Whatever comes after the baseball season,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is a hobby for Bo Jackson, just like hunting and fishing.&quot;But now, sadly, Bo's hobby has hobbled him. One of the fastest athletes in the world is on crutches. After having suffered a fracture-dislocation of his left hip in a open-field, one-on-one tackle during a National Football League playoff game on Jan. 13, he developed traumatic chondrolysis of the hip joint and avascular necrosis of the femoral head, a condition as serious as it sounds. Because of a lack of blood supply, his hip-socket cartilage and the top of his thighbone are deteriorating, not healing.Bo's future in both baseball and football is uncertain. His hobby has turned into a horror.Bo thought it would be fun to play both sports. At least that's what he thought back in 1987.&quot;The more I thought about playing football and baseball -- I knew Jim Thorpe had done it a long time ago; I saw the movie about him -- the more it sounded like fun,&quot; he recalled in his best-seller autobiography, &quot;Bo Knows Bo (Doubleday),&quot; written in collaboration with Dick Schaap. &quot;That really was the attraction. I thought it'd be fun. It had nothing to do with wanting to prove anything.&quot;I'd proved in college that I could play football. I'd proved in Kansas City that I could play baseball. And it had nothing to do with money. I didn't need any more money than I was getting from the Royals, and I knew I could live on a lot less. I just didn't want to cheat myself out of some fun. I didn't want to look back in 20 years and think, 'Wouldn't it have been fun doing that?&quot;But in enjoying the fun of four years of playing both baseball and football, Bo may have cheated himself out of the fun of developing into one of baseball's true superstars.Even if Bo returns to the big leagues, it's difficult to believe that he will be as fast or as reckless as he was. His speed is sure to be slowed by his damaged hip. Perhaps his bat speed will be slowed too. That was the risk he took when he joined the Raiders, the risk that just about everybody but Bo accepted as inevitable. For a running back, the usual injury is &quot;a knee,&quot; as football people call it. Torn ligaments, torn cartilage. But being different, Bo went down with a hip.What N.F.L. orthopedists call a &quot;hip pointer&quot; occurs every so often. Originally, that's how Bo's injury was diagnosed. But instead of getting better, it got worse. Just as Bo was a rarity, so was his injury.Other football players have recovered from a similar injury, notably George Adams, a New England Patriots running back. After having been the Giants' first-round draft choice in 1985, he missed the entire 1986 season with what the Giants then called a &quot;chipped pelvic bone&quot; but what has recently been described as &quot;almost identical&quot; to Jackson's ailment.&quot;George was on crutches that whole season,&quot; said Ottis Anderson, the Giants running back, on Friday after accepting the Potamkin male athlete of the year award. &quot;But George came back in 1987, and he's been playing ever since.&quot;Maybe that's why Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general genius, keeps predicting that Bo Jackson will be a running back again, possibly in the upcoming season. But will he be the same running back? And when Bo was on waivers after the Royals released him last Monday, none of the 26 major-league teams considered him worth the risk of assuming his Royals salary of $2,375,000 this season.The Yankees had first crack, but according to General Manager Gene Michael, &quot;there wasn't one doctor who felt we should take the risk.&quot; The new Yankee front office decided not to throw bad money after bad, such as the three-year $5.6 million investment in Pascual Perez that produced a 1-2 record last season. More important, George Steinbrenner apparently had no say in the decision. That's progress.Sooner or later, look for Bo to return to baseball with an &quot;if&quot; contract -- a modest signing bonus plus a graduated salary depending on how soon and how much he plays.Don't worry about Bo's finances. Like most multimillion dollar athletes, he is insured for millions against the possibility of a career-ending injury or accident.The shame is that Bo had the power tools to be one of baseball's most dominant players if he had concentrated on baseball. He hit broken-bat home runs to the opposite field. He once nailed a baserunner at the plate with a 300-foot arrow to the catcher, on the fly. He outran infielders' throws to first base.Bo could do it all in baseball -- all but work on reducing his strikeouts.Since joining the Royals in 1986, Bo struck out 638 times, roughly once every third official at-bat. If he had gone to the Instructional League every November, maybe he could have educated himself to the parameters of the strike zone. He preferred to join the Raiders every November instead.But what Bo Jackson thought would be fun may turn out to be, in an athletic sense, funereal.&quot;Whatever comes after the baseball season,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;is a hobby for Bo Jackson, just like hunting and fishing.&quot;But now, sadly, Bo's hobby has hobbled him.

"Children's Television Workshop, the educational production company responsible for bringing &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to public television, announced yesterday that it would begin work on an ambitious new series intended to improve children's reading and writing skills.The series, called &quot;The Ghostwriter,&quot; is scheduled to begin on PBS stations in the fall of 1992. The target audience will be children 7 to 10 years old.&nbsp;Children's Television Workshop announced the beginning of production after receiving a commitment for a $5 million grant fromNikeInc., the maker of athletic shoes. Nana Griller, the assistant director of information at Children's Television Workshop, said theNikegrant was the largest single corporate donation ever made to a children's television show. The show's overall budget will be $20 million for 48 episodes, with about $8.8 million coming from PBS and Children's Television Workshop, and the rest from other foundation and Government sources.The executive producer of &quot;The Ghostwriter&quot; is Elizabeth Nealon, formerly vice president of MTV International. The show's stylistic approach will incorporate visual and musical techniques borrowed from MTV, Ms. Griller said. The format will also use graphics to make the reading of print on screen more entertaining.The stories will center on six children, three girls and three boys, and their interaction with an unseen ghost who can communicate with them only through writing. At the end of the first season, the ghost will be revealed to be a famous writer from the 15th or 16th century -- but not Shakespeare, Ms. Griller said.",0.0994408369408,0.310768398268,270 words,Nike'sprint ads,"June 28, 1991, Friday, Final Edition",426 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Because Bo knows everything, one could plausibly argue that Portland knows advertising. So where better to locate the only museum in the United States devoted solely to advertising?Portland, after all, is home to Wieden &amp; Kennedy, currently the ad trade's hottest agency, whose 10 years of work forNikeathletic shoes -- including the slogans &quot;Bo knows&quot; and &quot;Just Do It&quot; -- are the subject of a study by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.&nbsp;Now, in addition to the advertising, Portland has the American Advertising Museum. As a result, this city finds itself in the middle of a debate among anthropologists and historians, who have long argued whether magazine and newspaper ads, television spots, and radio commercials deserve a place in the halls of academe and on museum walls.&nbsp;Amazed by the Lack of StudyAs Jan Kurtz, the museum's executive director, strolled past photographs of the late comedian Ed Wynn dressed in his Texaco fire chief's garb and exhibits showing the evolution of Marlboro cigarettes from a women's to a men's brand, she expressed annoyance that anyone would question advertising's place in the scholarly orbit.&quot;Given the role advertising has played in the lives of ordinary Americans and its influence on business and design, it's amazing how little it's been studied,&quot; she said.In his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1973 Book, &quot;The Americans: The Democratic Experience,&quot; the historian Daniel J. Boorstin wrote that &quot;the force of the advertising word and image would dwarf the power of other literature&quot; in the 20th century. And yet, he complained, it &quot;has been less adequately chronicled than almost any other major institution.&quot;The 18 years since Dr. Boorstin's lament have brought a striking change, with historians who once deigned to study only the writings of diplomats now dipping into housewives' diaries and other remains of &quot;low culture.&quot; Advertising, as a chronicle of the fantasies of regular Americans, has benefited from the renewed interest in cultural and social history.&quot;There's certainly been a mini-boom in the last five years and a renewal of interest in advertising and what it tells us about American life,&quot; said Scott A. Ellsworth, the chief historian at the Center for Advertising History at the Smithsonian.A growing number of social and cultural historians have visited the Smithsonian's collection, which includes oral histories of advertising campaigns for Alka-Seltzer, Pepsi-Cola, Marlboro, Federal Express, Cover Girl makeup and Campbell soup, said Mr. Ellsworth, who was in Portland recently working on an oral history of theNikecampaign.The growth of the American Advertising Museum, which in June celebrated its fifth anniversary, provides further evidence that advertising's intellectual stature is rising. Founded with $300,000 in seed money from the Portland Advertising Federation and a meager crop of advertising books, the museum's collection now includes 200,000 print advertisements dating back more than a century, 44,000 slides of billboards and a library of 4,000 advertising books.More important may be the steady stream of visitors, from the professional to the merely curious, to take in the public exhibits.&nbsp;Museum Is CrowdedForty-four thousand people stopped by the museum during a seven-week period in 1988 to view its exhibition on the history of Claymation, the process that animated the &quot;California Raisins,&quot; which was developed by a Portland resident, Will Vinton.Interest in the museum has grown so much that its staff of four, with support from Advertising Age magazine, has assembled a traveling exhibit that will start making its way around country this fall. Titled &quot;Advertising Comes of Age: The History of Advertising 1920-1969,&quot; the exhibit will open at the Art Directors Club in New York on Sept. 23.Some of the museum's holdings would be classified as mere curiosities. On display is the uniform of Johnny Roventini, the bellhop whose &quot;call for Philip Morris!&quot; resounded in radio ads in the 1940's, and a history of the Planter's Nut and Chocolate Company's monocled dandy, &quot;Mr. Peanut,&quot; which was created in 1916 by Antonio Gentile, a 13-year-old schoolboy from Suffolk, Va., who was awarded $5 for his effort.But other pieces well illustrate many of the currents in American culture. Political advertisements in the museum show that criticism of political marketing dates back to Andrew Jackson's Presidential campaign in 1828, when a rabble of frontiersmen, small farmers and urban workers led him to victory over President John Quincy Adams.&quot;The question, which was first asked then, is how do you get mass communication without resorting to the sound bite,&quot; Ms. Kurtz asked.But Ms. Kurtz, a 29-year-old American who grew up in Ethiopia, one of six children of Presbyterian missionaries, said advertising was also a way for an outsider like herself to discover the peculiarities of contemporary culture.&quot; 'Just do it,' &quot; she said, referring to theNikeadvertising slogan, &quot;says something about Americans.&quot;",0.0455749895266,0.349240275853,844 words,Nike'sprint ads,"July 21, 1991, Sunday, Final Edition",427 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"After trading lower most of the day on a worrisome inflation report, stock prices made a strong comeback yesterday to finish mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.19 points to finish at 3,065.30.Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderately heavy at 184.5 million shares, down from 199.5 million on Tuesday. The Big Board composite was up 0.37, to 219.37, with losing issues narrowly outpacing gainers by 833 to 778.&nbsp;The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.67 to finish at 397.41, a new high for the second consecutive day, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.56, to 391.81.A late surge of buying narrowly helped the Nasdaq index to its fifth record high in five days, to 556.17, up 0.49. Similarly, the Russell 2,000 was up 0.2, to 188.04.&nbsp;Stocks Off Most of DayStocks were down for most of the day after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released October producer prices that showed the highest monthly increase in a year. The news immediately touched off investor concern about rising inflation and put investors on the defensive ahead of today's consumer price numbers.A sharply lower bond market weighed heavily on stocks early, but they recouped some of their losses after the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, Janet Norwood, said the core Producer Price Index may have been overstated by one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent.Peter Labe, chief investment strategist for Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross, said the market's initial reaction to the producer prices data, and then the turnaround, was a typical reaction.He noted the across-the-board activity where just about every issue was hit, and was mildly impressed with the day's volume that showed there was widespread participation. &quot;There is probably no case yet for an up market, or down market, in the near term,&quot; he said. &quot;But staying in a narrow range does afford investors the opportunity to wade into the market to pick some good stocks.&quot;In trading yesterday, Immune Response said the clinical trials of its HIV therapeutic vaccine seemed to show the drug safe, but had not yet shown whether it was effective. The stock fell 15 3/4, to 46, after a Food and Drug Administration panel meeting reduced hopes of a quick approval of the vaccine, as a number of analysts lowered their ratings.Nikeshares fell 1 1/8, to 62 1/4 yesterday, as Josie Esquivel, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, lowered her rating on the athletic shoe maker after the stock reached her 1992 price target. She noted that no further adjustments were made on the stock, like earnings estimates, and expects the stock to appreciate from 10 to 25 percent over the next 12 months.According to an Oppenheimer analyst, George Krug, Tuesday's Department of Agriculture crop report of low grain inventories looks good for increased plantings next year, with an increased demand for fertilizer. IMC Fertilizer stock rose 3/8 to close at 51 3/4.After telling analysts on Tuesday that it would probably not meet 1992 earnings projections, Kimberly-Clark shares fell 6 3/8 yesterday, to 94, as several analysts reduced their earnings estimates and a few, their ratings. The company held a two-day meeting with analysts, which started on Tuesday, and said analysts' 1991 forecasts were in the ballpark, and their 1992 estimates were possible, but highly doubtful unless market conditions changed fast.Nordstrom, the shoe and apparel retailer, was down 1 5/8, to 37 1/2, as analysts lowered year-end earnings estimates, after the retailer reported disappointing third-quarter results.On the other side of the coin, Campbell Soup reported a 25 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, to $1.02 a share, compared to 82 cents a share, and the stock responded by rising 1 7/8, to 81 3/8.Analysts said that United Technologies is likely to take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of at least $500 million to pay for its efforts to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, as the stock rose 1/2 to close at 50 1/8.Except for concern about dilution, analysts who follow Goodyear could not find a specific reason for the price decline in the stock, as the tire maker's secondary offering of 12 million shares, priced at $50 a share, began trading. The stock was off 1 1/8, to 49 3/8.Traders said after Scimed Life Systems told analysts at a meeting in California that it was not on the verge of pulling its Express Catheters from the United States because of patent challenges, the stock rose 6 1/4, to 58 1/2.",0.0801842991317,0.477683856105,754 words,Nike'sprint ads,"August 9, 1991, Friday, Final Edition",428 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"The Kansas City Royals took a stunning step today, placing Bo Jackson, the oft-injured two-sport star, on unconditional-release waivers. A lawyer for the Players Association immediately challenged the propriety of the release.Herk Robinson, the club's general manager, announced the Royals' action at a news conference at their spring training complex in Haines City, Fla.&nbsp;&quot;We felt this was the cleanest manner in which to handle this and was probably the most equitable to all involved,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;We've got nearly $2.5 million involved in a situation like this; finances do enter into a situation like this.&quot;The move came amid unconfirmed reports that Jackson would not be able to play baseball or football again because of complications after an injury to his left hip. He suffered the injury playing for the Los Angeles Raiders in a National Football League playoff game on Jan. 13.&nbsp;'Don't Count Me Out'Jackson, at his own news conference in Birmingham, Ala., said today that he believed he would be able to play baseball this season.&quot;Don't count me out,&quot; the 28-year-old Jackson said at a brief news conference with Dr. James Andrews of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, shortly before the Royals' announcement.Dean Vogelaar, the Royals' vice president for public relations, said by telephone from Haines City: &quot;Based on the medical reports we have, there is a real question mark in our minds whether he can physically perform, this year or ever. We're not saying he's never going to play, but at this point we feel he can't perform.&quot;Vogelaar said the Royals were releasing Jackson under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the uniform player's contract, but Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Players Association, questioned the team's right to do that.&quot;My initial reaction is that this is an improper release,&quot; Orza said by telephone from his home in New York. &quot;Before reaching a firm conclusion, I want to talk to his agent and see all of the doctors' reports, but my initial impression is they cannot do this without substantial financial responsibility.&quot;&nbsp;Four Years of 2 SportsJackson, who has played professional baseball and professional football in the same year for four years and has been injured in each sport in each of those years, has a contract for the 1991 baseball season for $2,375,000. By releasing him now, the Royals said, they would owe him only 30 days' termination pay, which computes to $395,833, a savings for the club of $1,979,167. The club's right to release him now without paying him his entire salary, though, is what Orza questioned.If Orza's view turns out to be correct, most likely as determined by an arbitrator, the Royals could wind up paying Jackson his entire salary having lost him as a released player.The pertinent contract clause cited by the Royals says a club can release a player if the player shall &quot;fail, in the opinion of the club's management, to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify or continue as a member of the club's team.&quot;A club can release a player if he is injured as a result of a baseball mishap, but it would have to pay him his entire salary. Vogelaar noted that Jackson suffered his injury playing football, adding that he &quot;hasn't been on a baseball field one day.&quot;&quot;Their claim, I guess, is that there is an inability to play because of an injury incurred outside baseball,&quot; Orza said. But he added: &quot;I can't imagine that they didn't know he was injured in football when he signed their contract. After he was injured and before he signed, he reported to the Royals' team physician.&quot;Jackson agreed to his Royals contract on Feb. 18.According to a report from the Royals' team physician, Dr. Steve Joyce, &quot;special X-ray studies&quot; were preformed on Jackson Feb. 14-15 and they &quot;confirmed the loss of joint cartilage space and the development of early avascular necrosis of the femoral head.&quot;&quot;The loss of cartilage in Bo's case exceeds what is normally seen in the early stages of avascular necrosis,&quot; the report continued.The disease, in which a bone dies because the blood supply is cut off, is normally associated with older people and is rarely caused by single injury.&nbsp;'Significant Injury'Additional studies, Joyce's report said, prompted a recommendation to Jackson and the Royals' management &quot;that he not participate in the 1991 baseball season.&quot;Andrews, while declining to comment on the reports of avascular necrosis, said it was a significant injury and that blood flow to the hip joint was being monitored.&quot;There has been no collapse of his hip joint,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;That's the reason we're putting him on crutches.&quot;&quot;We're in a protective phase at this point,&quot; said the doctor, who left open the possibility that Jackson may eventually be able to play football for the Raiders.&quot;I don't want to speculate,&quot; Raiders Coach Art Shell said today in Hawaii, where he was attending the National Football League meetings. &quot;The doctor gave me some name of the injury. It was slight dislocation and with rest he would be all right. With rest, he's supposed to be able to play.&quot;In Orza's view, if the Royals proceeded with the release of Jackson, they would have to pay him his entire 1991 salary.The Royals will officially put Jackson on the waiver list Tuesday. Clubs will have 72 hours in which they can claim the outfielder for $1. If he clears waivers Friday, he would be free to sign with any team. If a club claims him, it would be responsible for his 1991 salary.If Jackson can't play one or both sports, it could affect his lucrative career as an advertising pitchman. Jackson may be as well-known for his &quot;Bo Knows&quot; series of ads for the athletic footwear companyNikeas he is for his play for the Raiders and the Royals.ANikespokeswoman, Liz Dolan, said today that no matter what the doctors advised Jackson to do about his hip, it wouldn't affect his contract withNike.&quot;We have never canceled a contract with an athlete due to an injury,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately, injury is part of sports and we understand that.&quot;But will the commercial offers end if Jackson's hip injury cuts his career short, reducing Bo to more average proportions?David Burns, who heads Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago, said he doubted that any advertisers will end their contracts with Jackson if he is out all year and it is clear it is only for a year.&quot;If he is out period, I do think the advertising will stop,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Jackson's Injuries&nbsp;By The Associated Press&nbsp;1984: Missed half his junior football season with Auburn because of a shoulder injury.1985: Sustained a deep thigh bruise and missed the second half of Auburn's 14-10 loss to Florida and the last three games of the season.May 31, 1988: Tore left hamstring running out a grounder at Cleveland. Did not return until July 2.July 26, 1989: Placed on the 15-day disabled list with a pulled quadricep muscle in his left leg.July 17, 1990: Sustained minor tissue damage in his left shoulder, attempting a diving catch of a ball hit by Deion Sanders of the Yankees.

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed with large advertising budgets and superstar pitchmen,&nbsp;NikeCanada Ltd.&nbsp; and Reebok Canada Inc. dominate the $600-million athletic shoe business.In an industry where marketing prowess is as important as product quality, it's difficult for consumers to ignore pitches featuring high-profile athletes such as Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson.Faced with this daunting reality, Avia Canada recently launched its first radio campaign with an unorthodox approach.&nbsp;Rather than imitating its bigger rivals, Avia's quirky commercials used on-the-street interviews to see if people recognized the brand. The answers ranged from spring water to toilet paper.When the same question was posed to ''passionately committed athletes'' in fitness clubs - Avia's target market - the brand was easily identified.Peter Herbert, Avia Canada's general manager, said the challenge facing smaller players is finding ways to break through the clutter of larger competitors.''For someone to blast into this market you obviously don't do it by spending against (Nikeand Reebok),'' he said.''You have to do in a way that's going to catch people's interest. We try to do it in a way that's humorous.''Marketing consultant Tony Long, president of the Long Group in Toronto, said Avia's off-beat advertising campaign and clearly defined target market illustrates how small companies must develop distinct strategies to establish a foothold.Rather than going head-to-head against well-known brands, Long said the best approach is to identify specific niches.''If the big brands focus on media advertising, you should focus on consumer promotion, packaging or on the trade to buy shelf space,'' he said. ''Pick one or two tactics and put all your dollars behind them.''Drew Knox, vice-president of marketing and sales with Northern Algonquin Brewing Co. Ltd., said the company has worked hard at making sure each of its brands is clearly differentiated from its rivals.''We've tried to be right in the middle, and come out with a product that has more flavor and a bigger taste than the mainstream beers but not as highly hopped as the micro-brewed beers.''Last year, Algonquin became the first micro-brewery to advertise on television. Its distinctive spots promoted the taste of the product and the brewery's heritage - a sharp contrast to most campaigns, which feature youthful lifestyle themes.''We have something to say about the beer because product is hero,'' Knox said.Another approach is to find a segment of the market unhappy with the major brands, said Long, and develop a strategy to take advantage of this.Montreal-based Cott Beverages Ltd. followed this strategy after acquiring the rights to distribute Royal Crown Cola in Canada.Richard Berthiaume, private label sales manager with Cott, said Royal Crown's biggest selling point is that it costs less than rivals Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola, both of which boast expensive marketing budgets.''We can offer a better price because we don't have to support the marketing and television commercials,'' he said.",0.064981884058,0.484996549344,524 words,Nike'sprint ads,"June 24, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",434 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"IN HONG Kong, money rules, OK. One doesn't have to look far to uncover amusing examples of residents' fiery-eyed greed for the folding stuff. Last week, a cursory glance at the business pages of a Hong Kong newspaper revealed the co-ordinator of a team working with Vietnamese refugee children had advertised for volunteer helpers. She received just three replies, all from applicants wanting to know how much the work paid. The newspaper's columnist reflected how this reminded him of the Save the Rainforests campaign run in Hong Kong earlier this year. The campaign chief apparently got a call from a businessman keen to sponsor an acre of rainforest - so he could chop it down and develop the land.On street level, the fury with which commerce reigns is blatantly displayed. This is shop city. Store after store, their fat gullets stuffed with merchandise of every imaginable variety, stand shoulder-to-shoulder along main streets, slender lanes, dim alleys and sour-smelling markets.For the visitor, the effect is so dizzying that caution and carefully edited shopping lists fly out the window, and airlines do world-record business in excess baggage fees.&nbsp;There are as many theories on where to get the best buys in Hong Kong as there are shops themselves. Scratch any frequent visitor and they'll give you the name of a special tailor; a gem of a jeweller. Many rave about the night markets - Temple Street on the Kowloon side, in particular. I am not a fan of these noisy nocturnal bazaars, although perhaps I should not be so naive as to imagine a $2 pirate cassette from Temple Street isn't going to unwind into three miles of tape on the first play, or $10 fake Gloria Vanderbilt jeans won't split at the seams if I bend my knees.However, give me a market where I can try on clothes in front of a mirror and make my purchases in daylight hours when the dazzle from gold-painted fake Rolexes won't cause temporary blindness. My choice for cheap and civilised shopping is Stanley Market, about 15 kilometres from Central on the south side of Hong Kong Island; take a No. 6 or No. 260 bus from the Exchange Square Bus Terminus.This will probably be a double-decker, Hong Kong being one of the last outposts for these tall, narrow buses handsomely plastered with advertising for everything from Madame Pearl's magical cough elixir to grime-spattered anti-pollution messages.The best way to do Stanley is to arrive late morning and settle into a beachfront restaurant for lunch. No use charging about the market on an empty stomach, making rash buys and then wondering how to juggle 25 plastic shopping bags while you take lunch. Along Stanley Main Street are positioned various bars and eating places, the favoured haunts of expatriates on weekends.Most of the restaurants are owned by the same company, New Restfull (sic)Limited, and their names are variations on the Stanley theme. There's Lord Stanley's Bar &amp; Bistro, Stanley's Oriental and Stanley's French, plus the casual snack bar, Beaches. The most upbeat is Stanley's French, on the corner opposite the Hong Kong Bank, and the menu also features Asian dishes and a smattering of peppery Cajun. Be there at the pip of noon for an upstairs window table overlooking Stanley Bay bobbing with pleasure junks.On Stanley Market Street, the view of the water gives way to a sea of covered stalls. It's a good-humoured bustling sort of place, free of the sharp smells of a food bazaar, and open from 10 each morning to about 7pm, and even a little later in summer.Stock changes rapidly, but as of last week, there was a thriving trade in the goods mentioned in the following paragraphs. I have quoted prices in Australian dollars, rounding off the exchange rate at $HK6 for $A1. Bargaining is an integral part of business here and will work most successfully if you buy a swag of articles at one store and pay in cash or traveller's cheques. A lot of Stanley's stands do take credit cards, but shopkeepers will try to add between 5 and 10 per cent to your bargained price to cover their commissions, especially for American Express and Diners Club.Ties are $1.65 for a variety of patterns, but you'll have to look hard for preppy spots and stripes between bird-of-paradise colours, poor copies of Hermes designs and subtle motifs like bullfighters and Bart Simpson. These ties are labelled &quot;silk&quot;, though I suspect they're a blend of silk and rayon. But at this throwaway price, who cares? Men's reversible belts are $5, but the gold and silver paint on the buckles does flake. Trays of watches are set up on makeshift stands. Counterfeit branding is illegal in Hong Kong, so close copies of designer models carry names which approximate the originals. For example, Rator-brand pretenders to the Rolex crown are $23.50; these keep time well and will last at least as long as the battery but in terms of style and finish, they're not a patch on the fakes available in Bangkok.Most of the women's blouses, men's shirts and unisex blouson jackets in Stanley's clothing stores are made from talcum-soft washable silk and these are quality bargains. Sleeveless silk blouses in T-shirt style are $9.50, or pay from $32 for stylish short-sleeved models with padded shoulders and good buttons. Long-sleeved silk shirts can be had for $28, and pure cotton business shirts start at $11.50.Lined silk blouson jackets range from $55 to $83, but some of the patterns are colourful enough to be viewed from the moon. Zipper-jacket tracksuits made from parachute silk cost $37. Made-in-China cashmere sweaters in pastels and primary colours are $96; buy a size larger than you think you need because the cut is not generous, especially under the arms.Designed to cut a swathe through any boardroom are two-piece linen women's suits with power shoulders, structured jackets and embroidered lapels. Yours for $240, absolute tops. Obviously one wouldn't take a chance on fit when paying these prices, but the bigger clothing stores in the market have change rooms and full-length mirrors, and can do minor alterations within an hour.Children's clothes are a snip - best buys include denim jackets with cute designs such as Garfield or American baseball team logos for $24. Matching kids' jeans start from $11. There are a couple of toy shops in Stanley displaying a veritable galaxy of Legoland sets - a large fire station, for example, is $59. Hand-held Game Boys are $96, and latestrelease game cartridges start at $38.Polo-style shirts with Calvin Klein labels are an astonishing $2, but the hand-lettered signs on the towering cardboard boxes announce you can't try these on. From my experience, counterfeit Kleins shrink away to something that would fit a Ken Doll if you pass them anywhere near a tumble dryer, so hand-wash in cold water and dry naturally. Ditto for Bossini men's briefs $4at a throw.Jeans and casual pants are dead cheap. Those Levi's 501s for $50 may be the real McCoy but they're sure to be factory rejects, so look for flaws or dye blotches. The Wonderful Horse Company does a great line in &quot;Comfortable Jordache Basic Expedient Choice&quot; gaberdine slacks for men. For $60, you get the &quot;updated function&quot; line in beige, khaki, navy or black. &quot;This pair of pants,&quot; the label informs, &quot;was once loved by an American hero and makes you as a good officer.&quot; Running shoes are heaps cheaper than in Australia, and theNikesand Reeboks are the real thing. For teenagers on the cutting edge of the fashion curve, Reebok Pumps andNikeAir high-cut boots are $116 a pair. If you want the price to drop faster than a Michael Jordan slam-dunk, feign shock and walk away - I saved $16 by pleading poverty and threatening to buy a pair of totally uncool alternatives.In the large luggage shop, on the left-hand side walking away from the beach, I was crisply informed there are no better prices in Hong Kong. A copycat Samsonite oyster-shell case, 65-centimetre size, is $208. &quot;Of course, that doesn't include special 15 per cent discount for beautiful ladies,&quot;smiled the shopkeeper. Of course. A 76-centimetre Eminent brand black canvas case is $50. I have subjected one of these Eminent models to two years of brutally frequent travel and it shows no sign of wear.Chinese chops in mottled shoushan stone are $10 plus $5 for engraving any name in Chinese characters. The little chops are topped with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac; from the display chart, choose the one corresponding to the year of your birth. An engraved chop and red ink pad come splendidly boxed and make an excellent take-home present. Other fun purchases are hand-crafted bamboo and padded cotton Christmas decorations at $4 per pack of six.Also good buys in the gift line are adult's one-size long cotton dressing gowns with flapping sleeves and tie belt for $10. Short happi coats writhing with embroidered dragons are $14, while Chinese-style silk pyjamas with stand-up collars and frog buttons are $9 for children and $13 for adults. Gary Lee's shop is a treasure trove of hand-embroidered table and bed linen, with prices varying according to the amount and detail of patterns. As a sample, a plainly stitched linen cloth and napkins for a rectangular table seating eight costs $48.On Stanley New Street leading to the market from the taxi stand and bus station there's a Watson's pharmacy on the left-hand side. Watson's is a chain operation, the Hong Kong equivalent, if you like, of Boots in the UK, and prices for perfumes and cosmetics are about equal to the duty-free shops at Kai Tak Airport, and sometimes better if there are specials. Lancome and Clarins cosmetics are the same price as the airport; as a couple of examples, 15-millilitre Lancome specific eye cream for $40 and 20-millilitre Clarins eye contour balm for $33.50.For important purchases in Hong Kong - good watches, gemstones, cameras and electronic wares - markets such as Stanley are not recommended.

a gem of a jeweller. many rave about the night markets - temple street on the kowloon side, in particular. i am not a fan of these noisy nocturnal bazaars, although perhaps i should not be so naive as to imagine a $2 pirate cassette from temple street isn't going to unwind into three miles of tape on the first play, or $10 fake gloria vanderbilt jeans won't split at the seams if i bend my knees.however, give me a market where i can try on clothes in front of a mirror and make my purchases in daylight hours when the dazzle from gold-painted fake rolexes won't cause temporary blindness. my choice for cheap and civilised shopping is stanley market, about 15 kilometres from central on the south side of hong kong island; take a no. 6 or no. 260 bus from the exchange square bus terminus.this will probably be a double-decker, hong kong being one of the last outposts for these tall, narrow buses handsomely plastered with advertising for everything from madame pearl's magical cough elixir to grime-spattered anti-pollution messages.the best way to do stanley is to arrive late morning and settle into a beachfront restaurant for lunch. no use charging about the market on an empty stomach, making rash buys and then wondering how to juggle 25 plastic shopping bags while you take lunch. along stanley main street are positioned various bars and eating places, the favoured haunts of expatriates on weekends.most of the restaurants are owned by the same company, new restfull (sic)limited, and their names are variations on the stanley theme. there's lord stanley's bar &amp; bistro, stanley's oriental and stanley's french, plus the casual snack bar, beaches. the most upbeat is stanley's french, on the corner opposite the hong kong bank, and the menu also features asian dishes and a smattering of peppery cajun. be there at the pip of noon for an upstairs window table overlooking stanley bay bobbing with pleasure junks.on stanley market street, the view of the water gives way to a sea of covered stalls. it's a good-humoured bustling sort of place, free of the sharp smells of a food bazaar, and open from 10 each morning to about 7pm, and even a little later in summer.stock changes rapidly, but as of last week, there was a thriving trade in the goods mentioned in the following paragraphs. i have quoted prices in australian dollars, rounding off the exchange rate at $hk6 for $a1. bargaining is an integral part of business here and will work most successfully if you buy a swag of articles at one store and pay in cash or traveller's cheques. a lot of stanley's stands do take credit cards, but shopkeepers will try to add between 5 and 10 per cent to your bargained price to cover their commissions, especially for american express and diners club.ties are $1.65 for a variety of patterns, but you'll have to look hard for preppy spots and stripes between bird-of-paradise colours, poor copies of hermes designs and subtle motifs like bullfighters and bart simpson. these ties are labelled &quot;silk&quot;, though i suspect they're a blend of silk and rayon. but at this throwaway price, who cares? men's reversible belts are $5, but the gold and silver paint on the buckles does flake. trays of watches are set up on makeshift stands. counterfeit branding is illegal in hong kong, so close copies of designer models carry names which approximate the originals. for example, rator-brand pretenders to the rolex crown are $23.50; these keep time well and will last at least as long as the battery but in terms of style and finish, they're not a patch on the fakes available in bangkok.most of the women's blouses, men's shirts and unisex blouson jackets in stanley's clothing stores are made from talcum-soft washable silk and these are quality bargains. sleeveless silk blouses in t-shirt style are $9.50, or pay from $32 for stylish short-sleeved models with padded shoulders and good buttons. long-sleeved silk shirts can be had for $28, and pure cotton business shirts start at $11.50.lined silk blouson jackets range from $55 to $83, but some of the patterns are colourful enough to be viewed from the moon. zipper-jacket tracksuits made from parachute silk cost $37. made-in-china cashmere sweaters in pastels and primary colours are $96; buy a size larger than you think you need because the cut is not generous, especially under the arms.designed to cut a swathe through any boardroom are two-piece linen women's suits with power shoulders, structured jackets and embroidered lapels. yours for $240, absolute tops. obviously one wouldn't take a chance on fit when paying these prices, but the bigger clothing stores in the market have change rooms and full-length mirrors, and can do minor alterations within an hour.children's clothes are a snip - best buys include denim jackets with cute designs such as garfield or american baseball team logos for $24. matching kids' jeans start from $11. there are a couple of toy shops in stanley displaying a veritable galaxy of legoland sets - a large fire station, for example, is $59. hand-held game boys are $96, and latestrelease game cartridges start at $38.polo-style shirts with calvin klein labels are an astonishing $2, but the hand-lettered signs on the towering cardboard boxes announce you can't try these on. from my experience, counterfeit kleins shrink away to something that would fit a ken doll if you pass them anywhere near a tumble dryer, so hand-wash in cold water and dry naturally. ditto for bossini men's briefs $4at a throw.jeans and casual pants are dead cheap. those levi's 501s for $50 may be the real mccoy but they're sure to be factory rejects, so look for flaws or dye blotches. the wonderful horse company does a great line in &quot;comfortable jordache basic expedient choice&quot; gaberdine slacks for men. for $60, you get the &quot;updated function&quot; line in beige, khaki, navy or black. &quot;this pair of pants,&quot; the label informs, &quot;was once loved by an american hero and makes you as a good officer.&quot; running shoes are heaps cheaper than in australia, and thenikesand reeboks are the real thing. for teenagers on the cutting edge of the fashion curve, reebok pumps andnikeair high-cut boots are $116 a pair. if you want the price to drop faster than a michael jordan slam-dunk, feign shock and walk away - i saved $16 by pleading poverty and threatening to buy a pair of totally uncool alternatives.in the large luggage shop, on the left-hand side walking away from the beach, i was crisply informed there are no better prices in hong kong. a copycat samsonite oyster-shell case, 65-centimetre size, is $208. &quot;of course, that doesn't include special 15 per cent discount for beautiful ladies,&quot;smiled the shopkeeper. of course. a 76-centimetre eminent brand black canvas case is $50. i have subjected one of these eminent models to two years of brutally frequent travel and it shows no sign of wear.chinese chops in mottled shoushan stone are $10 plus $5 for engraving any name in chinese characters. the little chops are topped with the 12 animals of the chinese zodiac; from the display chart, choose the one corresponding to the year of your birth. an engraved chop and red ink pad come splendidly boxed and make an excellent take-home present. other fun purchases are hand-crafted bamboo and padded cotton christmas decorations at $4 per pack of six.also good buys in the gift line are adult's one-size long cotton dressing gowns with flapping sleeves and tie belt for $10. short happi coats writhing with embroidered dragons are $14, while chinese-style silk pyjamas with stand-up collars and frog buttons are $9 for children and $13 for adults. gary lee's shop is a treasure trove of hand-embroidered table and bed linen, with prices varying according to the amount and detail of patterns. as a sample, a plainly stitched linen cloth and napkins for a rectangular table seating eight costs $48.on stanley new street leading to the market from the taxi stand and bus station there's a watson's pharmacy on the left-hand side. watson's is a chain operation, the hong kong equivalent, if you like, of boots in the uk, and prices for perfumes and cosmetics are about equal to the duty-free shops at kai tak airport, and sometimes better if there are specials. lancome and clarins cosmetics are the same price as the airport; as a couple of examples, 15-millilitre lancome specific eye cream for $40 and 20-millilitre clarins eye contour balm for $33.50.for important purchases in hong kong - good watches, gemstones, cameras and electronic wares - markets such as stanley are not recommended. check out the reputable stores along nathan road on the kowloon side or mega-malls such as oceancity, and make sure the red sailing junk logo of the hong kong tourist association is displayed in the shop window. if you do have a complaint, the association can follow up for you through its sydney office.take a calculator to stanley to do on-the-spot sums. if you don't have one, pay $5 for a pocket cheapie at one of the stalls. bargain with bravado, and may your pretend-polo shirts not shrink nor your american hero pants let the side down.fact fileqantas, phone (02)9570111, and cathay pacific, phone (02)9315555, have daily flights from sydney to hong kong. on both airlines, the economy excursion fare until november 21 is about $1,400 return. business-class fare is about $4,600 return and first-class fare is about $5,700.qantas jetabout has released cut-price hong kong holiday packages starting from $1,199 per person ex sydney for five nights. this includes return economy air fares, airport transfers, share-twin accommodation, two tours and mtr rail pass.a new qantas jetabout &quot;flexipac&quot;

"PETER TSOLAKIS hopes his move from winger to midfield becomes permanent at South Melbourne.He admitted yesterday he doesn't enjoy the wide role and thrived on the added involvement brought by his move to midfield last Sunday.His switch was one of the big factors in South Melbourne's return to top form and its domination in the middle led to a 3-0 win over Melbourne Croatia.&nbsp;Tsolakis' overall performance was slightly better than the two goals scored by Paul Trimboli and earned him the player-of-the-week title in the scorer with 13 goals last season but has found it more difficult to score in this campaign, with only three goals to date.&quot;I don't know the reason but defences are a lot more aware and marking tighter this season,&quot; he said.&quot;But getting stuck on the left wing hasn't helped either as I'm always coming in towards goal from an angle.&quot; Puskas plays with two wingers to get behind defences, so the wide players tend to cut in from near the byline giving them an acute angle to shoot at.Tsolakis has also been more willing to get involved in physical tussles this season.&quot;I've been battered around a bit in the years I have been playing NSL and I decided to put my foot down and get a bit tougher,&quot; he said.HERALD-SUNNikeAir Golden Boot award.

"WHAT can one say? The first of the Biology dance parties for 1991 was the biggest event since the 20,000 Leagues New Year's Eve Dance Party.Biology 3, which raised money for the Open Family Foundation (an organisation that helps Melbourne's homeless youth), was held at the Powerhouse on Sunday night.The first Biology party caught Melbourne's social scene off guard in June 1990, the second was welcomed with open arms in September and this third installment kept a menagerie of stomping baseheads enthralled well into the morning.&nbsp;As smoke billowed and strobes flickered, the atmosphere was one of euphoria and the basketball court cum dance floor became a sweatbox of Stussy andNike,a kaleidoscope of chaotic colors and a pumping mass of avid clubbers.The latest techno house cuts from Australia and overseas were thumped out by 30k of bass and were complemented by bizarre projections and artwork adorning the walls and roof.This visual decor was executed by Houdini, V.D.C, Voodoo and Tim Gruchy and proved effective.Local band Vertigo Hypo performed their techno house bleeps while DJs Mark James, Steve Robbins, Housemaster C from Adelaide and Terrence Ho took a well earned break.Fashion saw no limit as overalls, caps, hats, skivvies, chains, berets and an assortment of outrageous costumes were all accepted as the norm.If you're a clubbing enthusiast and stomper at heart but missed this event, just hope another Biology party is being planned to head our way in the future.DESPITE a vicious rumor circulating last week saying Chasers' &quot;Xpress&quot; night was finishing, promotions manager Grant Harrison assures that Friday nights are remaining the same at the Chapel St club.He doesn't know where the rumor started but assures the night is not finishing its year-and-a-half run.He said renovations are taking place upstairs and this may have been the catalyst for the misunderstanding.&quot;Xpress&quot; has proved extremely popular and has seen a wide variety of fresh fads and music become accepted in its time.DJs Paul Seidle and Mark James will keep playing the latest techno house tunes along with Tim Gruchy's chaos videos.END OF STORY",0.046176046176,0.479978354978,365 words,Nike'sprint ads,"September 4, 1991, Wednesday, ONTARIO EDITION",438 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"A 10-YEAR-OLD Newport boy was held up and robbed of his Reebok runners yesterday by two fashion-conscious bullies.The boy was stopped by two 12-year-old boys as he and a friend were standing at the corner of Hansen St and Mason St about 2.15pm.&nbsp;Police said the two thieves approached the boys and produced what is believed to be a knife, and ordered the boy to hand over his top-of-the-line Reebok pumps.Police said the boy handed them over to the tiny thieves, who were wearing thongs.The thieves ran to a waiting white early-model Holden station wagon with two black roof racks and a registration number beginning with KJ.One of the young villians is described as 140cm, with blond hair, fair complexion, slim and wearing a white T-shirt, board shorts and thongs.The other is described as about 145cm, brown hair, fair complexion, slim with two cross earrings in his left ear. He was wearing an orange and pink T-shirt and black tracksuit pants with green and pink stripes.The theft is part of a disturbing trend of muggings for expensive sports shoes in Melbourne.The quest for the shoes has included at least five attacks over the past year.The trend developed from the graffiti gangs of the United States and Sydney and has seen expensive runners and basketball boots, particularlyNikeand Reebok, sought by thieves.Some of the shoes are more expensive than those locally-produced because of tariffs, making them more prestigious.END OF STORY",-0.0351449275362,0.421376811594,248 words,Nike'sprint ads,"December 7, 1991, Saturday, SATURDAY SECOND EDITION",439 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Controversy and scandal have a way of attaching themselves to sport, just as entrepreneurs do with Labor Governments, and in the three Olympic Games I attended between 1980 and 1988 I saw three rippers.In Australia you heard the sanitised versions, now I think it's time for the truth about administrative bungling, poor managerial policy and, of course, Ben Johnson and Seoul.Casting my mind back 11 years should be difficult but the day a Soviet official cost Aussie triple jumper Ian Campbell an Olympic gold medal is still ultra clear. I trained with Campbell as a youngster and owe him plenty for my later international successes.He was the consummate professional and during the lead-up meeting in Europe it was obvious he was going to be hard to toss in Moscow.&nbsp;Campbell jumped a distance that I have no doubt would have won him the gold medal in front of Soviet Jaaque Udmae. Amid the jubilation that Australia might win its first triple jump gold medal the red flag went up and Campbell was called for scraping. This means that during his step phase one leg touched the track - a distinct disadvantage but illegal just the same.Needless to say Campbell was furious, a protest was lodged and this really was where it went from controversy to scandal. Australian officials asked to see film of the jump. I saw the film and in slow motion it was clear that no contact was made, therefore the jump was legal. Great news, or so we thought.The technical committee was not convinced and it was going to need some strong debating from our management.Many other countries, including the British, pledged support and the groundswell was enormous.So what did our officials do? They wimped it.It was early in the games and they thought the ensuing struggle would have upset Australia's credibility and affected team morale. Nonsense.Let us not forget that later in the games they allowed the gates at each end of the stadium to be opened, creating an unfair advantage for the Soviet javelin thrower. What of Campbell? He is now the European promotions manager forNike,but athletically I think it all ended on the tartan in Moscow.Four years later I jumped on the plane ready to kick butts in Los Angeles. I could not help but think that the Americans would not be past pulling similar stunts if they could get away with it. But hopes were high and controversies well out of mind.At our training camp in San Jose the captain's curse hit. It seems all Australian team captains are dogged with poor luck and Rick Mitchell was no exception.He injured a leg muscle and in the ensuing weeks was battling to prove his fitness.Because of Mitchell's silver medal effort in Moscow there was enormous pressure on management to include him in the individual event alongside Darren Clarke and Bruce Frayne. Mitchell's efforts to get fit were heroic and in a lead-up meet in Mt Sac he beat Gary Minihan, his only other competitor for the spot, and naturally thought he would be included.Management of our team had other ideas and thought Mitchell's form would barely see him through the first round. It left the decision very late and in the end time ran out. Mitchell's dream of making three Olympic finals was ruined and he blamed the team management.I remember returning after a night celebrating my Olympic medal, it was 2 or 3 in the morning and Mitch was sitting outside on his own. I asked if he was OK, but he didn't answer. Inside it was chaos, Mitchell had given an ultimatum: if he could not run the final leg in the relay team he would not run.Clarke, Minihan and Frayne were devastated as together with Mitchell they were a big medal chance.Concessions were made and after much anguish and discussion Mitchell was given the anchor leg. It is history now they ran fourth and Mitchell was passed in the final 200 metres by Nigerian Innocent Egbunike. Threats, lack of foresight and weak managerial decisions led to one of Australia's greatest runners first being denied his rightful place and then being forced, in frustration, to possibly cost his teammates a medal.I went to Seoul Olympics as team captain and needless to say the curse got me. I tore a quadricep and was forced to comment rather than compete, but boy, was there entertainment. In Seoul the grand-daddy scandal of all hit the Olympic movement. Everyone knows what happened with Ben Johnson, but what people don't know is the shockwaves it sent through the Olympic village.There were a lot of edgy people walking around and among them some Australians. I remember sitting in the dining hall and a person coming on the loudspeaker and after the customary couple of taps on the mike said &quot;testing, testing&quot;, a lot of athletes headed for the exits.Scandals, controversy I've certainly seen my share, but one can only wonder how much we really know.END OF STORY",0.05472394755,0.437436162871,812 words,Nike'sprint ads,"December 7, 1991, Saturday, SATURDAY EDITION",440 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Will the Sydney Swans be seen in another jumper next season? Word from Sydney has the Swans planning a new-look guernsey for 1992 to coincide with the club's 10th anniversary in Sydney.The new look will not necessarily involve a design change, but could see the colours reversed, so the red plays a more prominent role. Sydney is happy to remain the red and whites, but several club administrators believe more red would give the jumper a stronger appearance. I must admit to being a fan of their present jumper design and colour, particularly when comparing it with the hideous outfit worn by their northern neighbours, Brisbane. And, come to think of it, the Eagles and Crows are hardly Beau Brummels in the fashion stakes.&nbsp;I will let you judge for yourself which Sydney outfit looks more ferocious.LEFT-arm paceman Alan Mullally has returned to Perth a disillusioned young cricketer. When approached yesterday after a training session to ready himself for a club game with South Perth today, Mullally said he had nothing against the Victorian players, but was disappointed certain guarantees had not been kept by Bill Lawry, who lured him over.When asked if he had been guaranteed a number of Shield games for Victoria this season, Mullally's reply was affirmative. &quot;Yes, in a conversation with Bill Lawry (Victoria's cricket manager) before I moved.And a job that was supposed to be lined up fell through,&quot; he said.Mullally played in Victoria's dismal first-up showing in Brisbane against Queensland, was 12th man for the second match against NSW before getting his marching orders.&quot;Victorian coach Les Stillman told me 60 per cent of my deliveries in Brisbane had been wicket-taking balls yet that was my last chance,&quot; Mullally said.As he has played a game with Victoria this summer, Mullally will not be available for WA until next season.On April 2 he will fly to England for his second season of county cricket with Leicestershire.ADIDAS has sacked the Sydney Swans as one of its AFL representative clubs, leaving the Swans and Fitzroy the only two teams without boot sponsors.Long-serving Adidas man Ted Whitten, who immortalised the phrase &quot;We stuck it up 'em&quot;, confirmed last night the famous three stripes no longer would provide their product for Sydney.Whitten met a delegation of Sydney players last week, headed by Greg Williams and Dennis Carroll, but closed negotiations after refusing to agree to their terms.Williams is expected to wearNikeboots in 1991, but the rest of the Swans will have to work out their own contracts or buy their own boots.The football boot situation with clubs has become increasingly confusing. For instance, Diadora looks after Footscray, North Melbourne and Brisbane, except for the Bears who wear over size 12 as the company does not make boots in those sizes. (Captain Roger Merrett takes a size 14, so he probably will wear an Adidas boot, possibly with the stripes blackened over).And Puma sponsors Collingwood, Richmond, West Coast, and Hawthorn - at least, all Hawk players except Dermott Brereton, who has a highly paid contract with Adidas. Slightly confusing, you must agree.BIG WES Fellowes, without a senior game at Victoria Park in 1990 and fast approaching his 30th birthday, will be picked up in the AFL's internal draft on Wednesday, March 20.But if the Brisbane Bears decide to draft the big fella they can forget all about him pulling on one of their jumpers and the same goes for the other interstate clubs.Fellowes, who is training at VFA club Prahran under former Magpie teammate Brian Taylor, refuses to leave Melb$ourne even if it means an end to his 103-game career in the AFL. If he is not drafted by an interstate club, do not be surprised if St Kilda names him. The Saints would like Fellowes to release Paul Harding to a ruck-roving role.Harding enjoys more mobility than most big men in the competition, but lacks a few vital centimetres in centre bounces.ON THE subject of ruckmen, Richmond has high hopes for Ty Esler, drafted from Kooweerup in 1988.Esler - who answers to &quot;Lurch&quot;, and there is a certain similarity as our picture shows - stands 206cm (6' 9&quot;) and will play as the Tigers' No.1 ruckman against Fitzroy at VFL Park at 10am today.The good judges at Tigerland say Esler, 19, has been doing well in the pre-season and is a real chance to take some of the workload from the broad shoulders of &quot;little&quot; Mark Lee (199cm) and David Cloke (196cm).BRYAN Martin's call of yesterday's Blamey Stakes confirmed this writer's impression that he is the best in Australia.For someone who is tied to a desk on Saturday afternoons, Martin's highly descriptive and accurate call was the next best thing to being there, and it came hot on the heels of his memorable call of Better Loosen Up's last race win in the Japan Cup.As someone who has been a sometime critic of race callers, it is a pleasure to hear Martin continuing the tradition established by callers such as Ken Howard, Bill Collins and Bert Bryant.END OF STORY",0.157876911977,0.44450981241,847 words,Nike'sprint ads,"December 16, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",441 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Australian athletes are eagerly looking ahead to this year's world championships in Tokyo and next year's Olympics in Barcelona, particularly Lisa Martin-Ondieki.Martin-Ondieki is returning to Australia from the United States to train in Canberra with coach Dick Telford.She will bring four-month-old daughter Emma and husband Yobes Ondieki, the Kenyan distance runner, with her.Reasons for the move are to be with Telford and to be closer to her good friend Robert de Castella, with whom she will be able to train.&nbsp;Martin-Ondieki has been an enigma in Australian athletics for more than a decade. Her recent results are outstanding, but her early career was littered with disappointments.She started off running 110-metre hurdles with limited success and progressively moved up through the distances until she began having some success on the roads and on the track over 10,000 metres.Once she ran her first marathon it was obvious her talents lay there and after a promising finish in Los Angeles she went on to win gold at the Edinburgh and Auckland Commonwealth Games and a silver medal at the Seoul Olympics.Supported by shoe giantNike,she has done very well. But together with several incidents this has not made her popular with other Australian athletes.While the rest of the team before the Los Angeles Olympics were made to go to a training camp in San Jose, de Castella and Martin trained elsewhere coming in only on the odd day.I thought this was reasonable considering the nature of their event and the pressure de Castella was under, but in Martin-Ondieki's case it was the first in a series of snubs to the Australian athletes.The following year Martin-Ondieki returned to Australia to compete at the World Cup in Canberra over 10,000 metres and this time stayed with the Oceania team.Obviously, before a race she prefers to be on her own, but I know that in Canberra in 1985 her lack of participation in team activities alienated her further from her teammates.Before the 1986 Commonwealth Games the Australian team stayed in Belgium in a motel. It was hot and there was no air conditioning, millions of mosquitoes and a sewerage outlet 40 metres from the rooms.Ron Clarke made scathing criticism in an article that a national team should put up with this. Times were tough, but it made the team close.Martin-Ondieki also was in the same area, but she stayed in an apartment with her then husband and coach, Ken Martin.She would show up at the track to train, Ken would speak to the team officials and then she would leave. This behaviour did not go down too well with athletes and many snide remarks were exchanged.Debbie Flintoff-King, Glynis Nunn, Chris Stanton and many others sweated it out and it was not wise to be so aloof.In Seoul, Martin-Ondieki and many others did not stay in the village, but she spent some time there and I thought began to be part of the team. She contributed at meetings and looked as if she finally would take an active role as a senior athlete.Two years later in Auckland Martin-Ondieki and coach Telford probably unwittingly did a great deal of damage to her relationship with her fellow athletes.Before the games they made a great fuss and a few threats over Martin-Ondieki's wishes to stay out of the village with her fiance Yobes.All this achieved was a dogmatic stance by the Commonwealth Games Association which nearly cost many other athletes the hard-won privilege of spending nights out of the hustle and bustle of a village.In my opinion, if Lisa Martin-Ondieki wishes to prepare alone, so be it.She is a world-class performer and knows what she wants. It will be good for track and field and its commercial viability that Athletics Australia will have another linchpin to rely on in the next two years.END OF STORY",0.159273956496,0.397964432687,642 words,Nike'sprint ads,"December 16, 1991, Monday, FINAL EDITION",442 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Persuade someone on a tram to give them theirs, a knife helps, or they could buy a pair off a friend cheap, say about $60 for a worn pair.Of course, they could buy ordinary shoes, after all what could happen?

"Picture: FRED KOHL Feet first for the cause, Shane Froling uses his size 13s to push National Foot Health Week.Shane is one tall order in feet By MARY PRIOR Health Reporter BIG feet have always been a drag for Tassie Devils' forward Shane Froling, and it is no wonder.The 199-centimetre (6ft 6in) tall basketballer has had size 13 feet since he was just 13 years old.&nbsp;&quot;My feet stood out like flippers and I always got loads of flak,&quot; Froling said.He was relieved when they stopped growing but he has continued having trouble getting shoes his size - all of which makes him an ideal personality to kick off National Foot Health Week today.At 105 kilograms and playing basketball more than 20 hours a week, the 24-year-old said he wore out a pair of $200 to $300 basketball boots about every month.&quot;I'm lucky though because I'm sponsored by [sports shoe manufacturer]Nikeand get my boots for free,&quot; he said.It was a necessity to have good shoes which absorbed shock and gripped the court.But he still had problems when he wanted casual shoes. They had to be ordered and delivery could take anything from three weeks to two months.Froling has had a host of foot problems, ranging from a stress fracture of the toe to a couple of bouts of tinea and an inflamed nerve (Morton's neuroma) in one of his feet.His foot specialist (podiatrist) even prescribed an arch support for him because of the neuroma.So it's not surprising that he thinks his feet are very important and should be comfortable at all times.A Hobart podiatrist, who spoke on behalf of the Tasmanian Podiatry Association but would not be named, said it was important to detect and treat foot problems early.People took an average of 700 steps each day and travelled more than 120,000 kilometres in a lifetime, she said.Many painful foot problems experienced in adult life originated from mechanical imbalances in growing children's feet and legs.Since most of the imbalances were controllable in children it was desirable to have regular foot checks during growing years - particularly if there were any abnormal gaits or shoe patterns.To mark National Foot Health Week, members of the Tasmanian Podiatry Association will examine children's feet for free at the Northgate Shopping Centre, Glenorchy, on Saturday from 10am to noon.",0.19875,0.558934294872,390 words,Nike'sprint ads,"February 17, 1991 Sunday",459 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"Lewis and Burrell fight for m ore than honour in Zurich Zurich LEROY BURRELL and Carl Lewis will clash again tonight in Zurich in a 100-metre showdown that could be the highlight of the grandest track and field meet on the Mobil Grand Prix circuit.With a tidy budget of $3.4 million, meet director Mr Andreas Bruger has spared no expense in recruiting the world's best talent for his five-hour show at Letzigrund Stadium.In addition to Burrell, Lewis, and Britain's Linford Christie in the men's 100 metres, Bruger also has Jamaica's 100-metre sensation, Merlene Ottey, returning to the track where she ran the 200 metres in 21.66 seconds, the third-fastest performance of all time.&nbsp;Burrell supplanted Lewis, his Santa Monica Track Club teammate, as the world record-holder in the 100 metres when he won the US Outdoor Championships on June 14 in 9.9 seconds.Burrell shook off a poor start to beat Lewis again three nights ago in Malmo, Sweden. Burrell's time was 10.06 seconds, Lewis's 10.13.Tonight's meet will be the last major competition before the world championships in Tokyo, and should reveal much about the gold medal chances of athletes such as Burrell and Lewis, who are scheduled to compete there.Bruger is offering a kilogram of solid gold to the team that can break the world record in the 400 metres relay.Bruger has sweetened the pot even more by offering $15,400 for a victory and $19,200 for a world record, in addition to whatever the gold is worth.On Saturday night, in Monaco, the Santa Monica foursome of Mike Marsh, Burrell, Floyd Heard and Lewis tied the world record, set by France a year ago. The Americans were timed at 37.79 seconds.Tonight's cast also includes Sergei Bubka, of the Soviet Union, fresh from his 28th revision of the world record for the pole vault, in Malmo.At considerable improvement to his bank account, Bubka became the first man to pole vault 20 feet outdoors, an achievement that rewarded him to the tune of $64,000 fromNike,his principal sponsor.Bubka is expected to shoot for the next metric notch on the world-record ladder, an elevation of 6.11 metres, which will probably earn him another $64,000.Earlier this season, when someone suggested Bubka was living too luxuriously for a Soviet athlete, he replied: &quot;Why does everyone ask me what I earn? Nobody makes a fuss over what Carl Lewis gets. Just because I'm a Soviet, everyone expects me to live like a tramp.&quot; Four nations are preparing a motion to put to the International Athletics Federation calling for tougher drug bans, New Zealand's delegate, Mr Ian Boyd, said in Wellington yesterday.The united approach has the support of IAAF president Primo Nebiolo but Boyd said it was not clear if he actually supported the proposed four-year ban.He said Nebiolo had told British authorities that the united motion could go before the IAAF council meeting as well as the International Congress in Tokyo next month.Athletes testing positive for steriod use face a two-year ban but Britain, New Zealand, Ireland and Canada want that extended to four.The last time the issue was debated in 1989 a tougher approach was defeated, but Boyd said the chances of achieving a longer ban were better this time.&quot;We have more support now than when it was last put - when we gained 40 per cent of the votes,&quot; he said.",0.158581504702,0.338662486938,562 words,Nike'sprint ads,"March 3, 1991 Sunday",460 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"To Adelaide teenagers Bill Gordon and Jason van de Merwe it's not getting from A to B that counts, it's how good you look along the way.From their cropped haircuts and trendy Oakley sunglasses to their surf gear and expensive Reebok running shoes, the Pulteney Grammar students are what every marketing firm dreams of.They did not just pay $150 for fashionable footwear; they admit they bought status symbols.&nbsp;&quot;You've got to look good,&quot; said Bill, 17, of Fulham Gardens.Why? &quot;Girls,&quot; said Jason, 16, of Eden Hills, who says leaving the laces undone completes the look.The pair were responding yesterday to a survey in this month's issue of Choice magazine, published by the Australian Consumers Association, which rated runners under $40 almost as highly as those that cost $160.It says shoppers may be choosing expensive shoes because of market hype.&quot;Price is not necessarily a guide to features such as comfort, shock absorption, stability or flexibility,&quot; it says.Choice asked Australian Olympic pentathlete Alex Watson to test 12 pairs of running shoes ranging in price from $34 to $160 over a 10km course covering bush trails, hard road, hills, sand, dirt and mud.Although prices varied widely, all 12 pairs rated highly. Of the shoes tested, the Dunlop KT 26 which retails between $34 and $60, was found the best value for money for casual runners.For runners who cover longer distances, recommended purchases could all be bought for under $100: Puma XR, Saucony Freedom 1000,NikeAircraft and Brooks Rage Hydroflow.Miss Rebecca Arthur, a manager of specialist sporting goods store Athletes Foot, said a lot of people shopped for running shoes on the basis of brand names.Teenagers especially were under a lot of peer group pressure to buy expensive brands.&quot;Some people who do a lot of activity don't spend enough on shoes and wonder why they get sore feet and back pain,&quot; she said.&quot;Others who spend too much get caught in the hype.&quot;Although expensive brands were not necessary for casual runners, she said a big outlay could provide motivation for inexperienced athletes to work out.South Australian sprinter Miss Lisa Attenborough said casual joggers did not necessarily need expensive shoes unless they had foot problems.The national sales manager forNike, Mr George Ruscuklic, said the Choice survey by only one athlete was &quot;totally inaccurate&quot; and &quot;totally misleading&quot;. The company tested runners in laboratories for &quot;months on end&quot; before they hit the market.&quot;To say a $34 pair is as good as a $160 pair is an insult to anyone's intelligence,&quot; he said.The benefit of runners at the top end of the market was &quot;the longevity of the cushioning system&quot;.They also helped avoid unnecessary ankle and lower back injuries.Choice said it could not comment if price indicated longer durability. The purpose of all running shoes - cheap or costly - was to protect the foot from injury.",-0.0191904761905,0.56919047619,500 words,Nike'sprint ads,"March 13, 1991 Wednesday",461 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Secretary Fiona O'Brien is a firm believer in power dressing for work.Her neatly groomed hair and carefully co-ordinated outfit and jewellery make obvious her belief in dressing for success.That is until you scan down to her feet - where to complete her look she has donned a pair of batteredNikerunners.&nbsp;Mrs O'Brien, 26, of Dulwich, is one of a small but growing number of women who keep their heels for the office but change to runners for the road.She began wearing runners to work about a year ago for comfort and speed during the 30-minute walk to her King William Rd office.&quot;I really don't like high heels, but you have to look all right when you're at work,&quot; she said. Her walk to work was motivated by the need to exercise and desire to see a little of the day after being confined in the office for hours.&quot;I like to do something every day because you do tend to just sit between nine and five,&quot; she said.Mrs Margaret Bullock, a private secretary of Rose Park, said she opted to wear runners while walking to work in the city because she was worried about the effect of high heels on her health.&quot;I'd happily wear them (high heels), but I think walking 40 minutes in them to work might do you some (back) damage,&quot; she said.Although she was aware running shoes with business clothes looked unusual, she said it did not bother her.&quot;It looks funny, but apparently in New York it's really the in thing,&quot; she said. Adelaide City Council's supervisory parking and bylaws inspector, Mr Denis Mills, who spends all day in the city, said he had noticed the trend.He estimated that about one in 10 women now wore runners with their business clothes.&quot;You see women walking to work from North Adelaide with impeccable business gear on top, and from the ankles down they've got sports shoes and socks,&quot; Mr Mills said.Attributed to filmHe attributed it in part to the 1989 release of the film Working Girl, in which Melanie Griffiths wore running shoes to work and then changed into heels.&quot;In the last year particularly I've noticed it's increased,&quot; Mr Mills said.&quot;Once upon a time you'd never see them.&quot;The trend of walking in runners is one which should be encouraged, according to Mr Trevor Jaques, the co-ordinator of the exercise and sports science section of the School of Physical Education at the University of South Australia.Mr Jaques said high heels changed the body's centre of gravity, so women who walked long distances in them increased their risk of sprained ankles and lower back injuries. &quot;We are designed to walk with our feet flat,&quot; he said.",0.132671115921,0.469863155363,437 words,Nike'sprint ads,"June 1, 1991 Saturday",464 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"When two vans embark from Christies Downs for Sydney on Sunday, the most important cargo - excepting, perhaps, one diminutive and very fit man - will be a pile of about 30 shoes.If David Standeven realises his latest ambition and crosses the Doncaster finish line to complete his fourth Westfield Run about nine days after his departure from Adelaide, his success will be largely due to those shoes.He doesn't intend actually using each of the 12 to 18 pairs he was contemplating taking early in the week. His basic stock for the Westfield is six pairs - all almost new, allNikes, together enough to last most of us 20-odd years - and by rights, they should see him through the 6 days he thinks it will take him to cover the 1028km of this year's course.&nbsp;However, a man about to run more than 1000km in less than a week must plan ahead. He must worry about having to step through puddles and pebbles and sand, mentally tackle how his feet would best tolerate hot asphalt or torrential rains, so there may be as many as 36Nikespiled carefully in one of the two mandatory vehicles he and a back-up crew of eight will drive to Sydney this weekend.All this for an event Standeven was not supposed to race. When he completed his last Westfield Run in 1989, earning line honors but not recognition as the winner, the Christies Downs athlete announced his intention to retire. So intense was his commitment to beating the field he had collapsed immediately after breaking the tape, requiring hospital treatment for exhaustion and dehydration; it seemed his body, and more importantly his mind, were telling him they had borne enough.But it seems even exhausted bodies recover, and well-worn feet get itchy. Standeven last year joined the crew of Victorian Peter Gray, who with the veteran's help became the youngest competitor in the event's history to finish. While happy at being able to assist in Gray's 11th place, Standeven discovered the sidelines did not provide the satisfaction he craved, and the 1990 event was barely over before he declared his intention to line up in 1991.&quot;Basically it's a different course,&quot; he said this week in explanation of his decision. &quot;Plus, being a crew member last year and watching everyone run, I found I couldn't sit back and do nothing.&quot;There's also the challenge of the handicap system they've introduced this year. It should make the event more interesting, a lot closer and safer.&quot;Standeven - all 160cm and 50kg of him - has been running about 200km a week in preparation for the long haul, and admits doubt as to whether it is enough. In previous years he has considered between 250 and 300km a week the ideal lead-up, but since his decision 12 months ago he has gradually built up to the shorter distance - two hours a day during the week, about six hours each Saturday and Sunday.&quot;Whether I'm as good as before, I don't know,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I still kept on running before I realy started training, but I won't know if it's been enough until the race starts. I'm feeling pretty good within myself, and although I've been running less, the experience of doing it before helps you get through.&quot;When you're out there, it's your mind, your attitude, that gets you through rather than actual fitness.&quot;Standeven can't pinpoint what has created the motivation that forces him through pain and discomfort towards a finish line hours or even days away. Never an outstanding athlete, he had played soccer &quot;to the best of (his) ability&quot; without ever earning personal awards when, after resting from sport for a year, he stepped out on the pavement.That was in 1982. Standeven, then 30, started with short distances but quickly advanced to 10km races and marathons, only to recognise that the longer the event, the more successful he was. Five years after he embarked on his jogging campaign he entered his first Westfield Run, achieving what he viewed as the ultimate goal when he managed to finish the 1987 event. The 10th place was a bonus.He bettered that with fifth the next year, then claimed line honors in his third attempt in 1989. The first prize went to Greek Yiannis Kouros, beaten to the line but determined the winner because he started 12 hours after the field.Kouros is not among the 24 entrants contesting this year's ninth Westfield Run, due to start at 11am on May 15. His absence is expected to give more runners an opportunity to claim line honors and major prize from a total purse of $100,000 for being the first to overcome what is considered the toughest course yet devised, through some of the highest terrain in the country.The route takes the Hume and Federal Highways from Sydney to Canberra, then deviates via the Monaro Highway to Cooma and along the Snowy Mountains Highway through Adaminaby and past Australia's highest town, Cabramurra.The new route winds its way thorugh the Kosciusko National Park, before taking the runners into the Murray Valley, across to Wodonga, and south to Melbourne and Doncaster.Standeven, who with eight others has been given a 24-hour handicap, realises many less ardent athletes regard him as a madman. Diagnoses of insanity aren't overturned by his inability to explain what it is that urges him on through agony and extremes of temperature, and in fact are probably augmented by his discussion of &quot;relaxing&quot; as he toils through an activity we Norms consider the absolute opposite of relaxation.&quot;The longer the event, the easier it is to relax,&quot; he said. &quot;Your body tends to cope, and the pain wears away.&quot;You think about how you'll tackle each stage, about positive things to keep you going. A lot of time you completely turn off to black out how much it hurts, other times you think about whatever there is to look forward to - like the next meal break.&quot;(A meal &quot;break&quot; from his 20-hour day of pounding the NSW and Victorian roads involves him walking instead of running as he consumes a bowl of pasta or spaghetti, washed down by cordial or water. It takes him almost 10 days to return to regular eating and sleeping habits when he returns home, after a week of continuous nibbling energy food and larger meals on the road, and he said he planned to sleep about six hours in total during the run.)&quot;Initially my ambition was to finish, but I did that, and then the aim was to win. I don't feel as if I've won one - in the history books Kouros won in 1989, not me - and that's something else to keep me going.&quot;But the main thing is to finish, to master the conditions and reach the end. In this race, to finish is to win.&quot;",0.182822997416,0.426050667679,1100 words,Nike'sprint ads,"June 21, 1991 Friday",467 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"Female commuters are shunning Adelaide's public transport routesafter dark.The risk of robbery, rape and assault by using train, bus andtram services has turned major routes into late-night abandonedcorridors, where only fearless or desperate women tread.Some say the terror in the shadows is so great they have shunnedjob promotions and opportunities for work which could placethem at risk.&nbsp;Women commuters' fears have prompted an Australian ServiceUnion member, Ms Judy Newbold, to say they stopped women doingshift work ending late at night or early in the morning, orfrom accepting responsible positions involving after-peak-hourfinishes.One, who six months ago accepted a promotion as a senior secretarywith an Adelaide business, believes she &quot;dices with death&quot;every time she gets off the train at a lonely northern suburbsstation.She refused to be identified, scared that it would make hera target for muggers.&quot;The station is lonely but well lit, which is good, exceptI feel I'm walking on a spot-lit stage announcing that I'm aboutto step into dark, isolated streets - easy prey,&quot; said the43-year-old mother of three.&quot;By the time I get home my pulse is racing and it takes mea good 10 minutes to calm down.&quot;State Transport Authority figures show that the weekday numberusing train and bus services plummets from 30,500 - not includingstudents - during the peak hours of 4pm to 6pm, to 9900 between6 and 10pm and again to 1500 from 10pm to midnight.With 8000 bus stops alone provided on the metropolitan routes,and scores of train stations, women, men and teenagers usingthe services have a good chance at finding themselves on theirown at some stage during their journey home.The prospect &quot;petrifies&quot; one woman, in her mid-20s, who doesnot drive and studies in Adelaide.She is forced to use a late-night train service to Noarlunga,so she can then catch a bus home to Hackham West.She said the bashing near the Noarlunga Interchange of a friend'sson, to the point where he was barely recognisable, so thievescould get hold of hisNikesports shoes, has escalated her fears.&quot;I always, always have someone waiting for me at the stationat the other end,&quot; she said.Figures released by the Police Department in its last annualreport show that robberies increased by 14.5 per cent on theprevious year.And of the 791 robberies reported last financial year a frightening325 occurred on streets, footpaths, laneways and squares, plus24 on buses, trains and trams and 24 at railway stations.Many of the stations, once thriving centres of suburban communities,stand in deserted silence at night - sentinels of 1990's fear.Lights, empty platforms and the names Millswood, Mitcham, EdenHills and Blackwood flash past the eyes of night commuters onlonely vigils to Belair.To Noarlunga Centre there are Ascot Park, Oaklands, Brighton,Marino, Hallett Cove Beach and Hallett Cove.The same applies on Outer Harbor and Gawler Central routes.These are middle-class Adelaide suburbs, invaded by graffitivandals at night, lonely souls with no-where else to go, gangsready to pounce on unsuspecting passers-by and home to our would-beif they could-be train commuters.&quot;It's just too big a risk to take,&quot; said Mrs Lena Rogers,26, who would look for waitressing work at night in the city if access totransport was safer.",0.0631510416667,0.4140625,575 words,Nike'sprint ads,"August 25, 1991 Sunday",469 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"SUPER Elliotts sports store in Rundle St, city, literally has knocked down the walls to make way for new stock, according to proprietor Mr Joe Catterwell.And, after an 11-year absence, the city store will again stock famous brand clothing and footwear.&quot;With the revamping we can get back into it and do a reasonable show,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.&nbsp;&quot;The return of the clothing and footwear means Super Elliotts has become the most complete sports store in the State without a shadow of a doubt.&quot;This sort of thing is probably unique in this country.&quot;Mr Catterwell said he had only recently signed a contract withNikeand Reebok to supply clothing and footwear.Despite the extensive range of sports goods most South Australians still associate the store with bicycles.Since the turn of the century the Super Elliott name in South Australia has been synonymous with cycling.Its origins began with making cycle frames and later motorbikes to the stage where Super Elliotts now has one of the largest range of bicycles in South Australia.Super Elliotts added sporting goods to the bike racks in the post-war years and its three levels in the city store now stock everything from snow-skis and surfboards to darts and billiard balls.&quot;We knocked down a couple of walls and put in these things called slatwalls so we can display more stock and give people more from which to choose,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.&quot;The revamp means we have brought it all in together and it looks fantastic.&quot;The store renovations have taken a year to complete with the major work only finished in time for the usual busy Christmas period.Mr Catterwell said Super Elliotts catered for every sport imagineable and the counters were staffed by experts in their field.He said the man behind the counter in the scuba diving section was an instructor while the gunshop was run by a former State clay target shooting champion.Mr Catterwell, a sports fishermen and former State-title holder, staffs the fishing tackle counter.&quot;We always like to have a bit of expertise in the field we are selling in,&quot; he said.It is expertise which helps Super Elliotts keep in touch with the latest sporting fads while still paying attention to the traditional areas.&quot;As scuba diving blossomed we entered the market and now we are well respected and recognised in the area,&quot; Mr Catterwell said.&quot;In darts we are the supplier of most of the pubs, clubs and hotels in the State - in this State we lead the competition.&quot;Of course, Super Elliotts would not be the same without the rows of bicycles for which it has become famous.

"Compressed air is blasted into the chamber and liquid gel flows. These high-tech happenings comprise just one step in the making of today's sports shoes.&nbsp;In the beginning, all that was needed was a sole and laces. Now even the laces are disappearing and the shoes are equipped with energy return systems and the soles have air, foam or gel padding systems.The sale of expensive sports shoes continues to defy the recession, with strong sales for shoes priced between $150 and $200 a pair- and that is the middle price range.While sales in the rest of the footwear industry slip, sport shoes have become a boom industry, developing an almost cult following, according to some retailers. Body and Sole sports store manager Mr Matthew Usher said teenagers were the main wearers of the shoes, which formed part of the &quot;street kid&quot; look which was becoming popular.&quot;The shoes have to be top of the range for sport but that's not what they use them for,&quot; he said.&quot;They just have to get the latest stuff and price does not seem to matter.&quot;The latestNikeAir Max shoes, with air cushioning in the heel and sole, cost about $219.A pair of Reeboks equipped with a pump system to fill the shoes with air are about $220 or $300 for the new season styles due out next month.The Athlete's Foot Adelaide store manager Ms Jo Napier said children usually wore the shoes every day and parents did not mind paying the prices for good shoes.She said teenagers had already been in the store asking about a newNikeshoe with fluorescent soles which will retail for about $280.&quot;They can't wait for that one,&quot; she said.",0.0830213903743,0.438012477718,277 words,Nike'sprint ads,"November 14, 1991 Thursday",473 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Alan Woehlk does not know for sure who murdered his son. He knows a man living not far from him was charged with the crime, and that the charges were dropped. He has a letter from him. The words are small, cramped, in black ink on yellow legal paper:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Mr. and Mrs. Woehlk,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry to hear what happened to Brett. I wanted to go to the funeral, but couldn't. I had nothing to do with his death at all.  Someday, I would like to talk with you both. Maybe between us, we may be able to find out who did it or had it done. This has been hard for me. . . . And I know it must be hard on both of you. It has almost ruined my life, and for what.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope we can talk someday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk (pronounced &quot;woke&quot;) keeps the letter in the neat manila folder he has compiled on his son's murder case. The file is thick, organized and incomplete, the way Woehlk's life has been since his son, Brett, 21, was found dead in a field near Lowry Park 11 months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts Woehlk that the murderer whether it is the man who wrote the letter or someone else is alive and free. He is confused about certain parts of the early police investigation and disappointed in the state attorney's prosecution of the alleged murderer, which was unsuccessful and left everything unsettled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk, a stoic, disciplined, finish-the-job kind of man, is left with so many loose ends he even went to a psychic for answers. He lives with a fundamental imbalance: He cannot rest until Brett's killer is behind bars, yet he knows that may never happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps worse than any of these things was the timing of Brett's death. After years of open-faced conflict, Woehlk and Brett&nbsp; were finally getting along.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many fathers and sons, they were at war from the time Brett a wild, carefree and irresponsible kid was 14. And like many fathers and sons, as Brett neared 20, miraculous realizations occurred on both sides of the barbed wire:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Dad's not so stupid after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I've forgotten what I was like as a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they started doing things together: Hunting, going to races, even surfing. Woehlk, 43, had to laugh at himself. He wasn't much for surfing, but Brett wanted to surf, so that's what they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Brett started trusting adults, realizing he had to make his own way in the world. He was still wild and crazy, but there was progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk was so pleased with his son that he gave Brett his Rolex watch. Woehlk, sales manager at Bolt and Nut, had earned the watch as payment for a construction job many years before. It was very special to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Brett the watch on his 20th birthday. Brett knew what the gift symbolized. He never took it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not on Brett's wrist when his body was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett Woehlk who was most likely killed April 2 after leaving work at a Farm Stores convenience mart, autopsy reports say was handsome, cocky and friendly and intensely loyal to his friends. His hair was almost shoulder length, dark with a touch of red. He had a reddish-brown mustache, straight white teeth and beautiful green eyes framed by long lashes. He was 5-feet-6 inches tall, and weighed 135 pounds, but it was &quot;all muscle,&quot; his father says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett had a way with women and took advantage of it. He was agile, a natural water skiier. He loved all water sports illustrated by the surfboard perched over his waterbed in his room. Most of all he liked lounging on the beach. In the Woehlk living room is a photo of Brett sitting shirtless on the beach raising a beer and grinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was Brett,&quot; Alan Woehlk says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Woehlk knew his son was no angel. Brett hung around with a tough crowd, basically good guys, but tough they drank, they partied, and Woehlk suspected they used marijuana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett, two years older than his only sibling, Shannon, was the kind of kid who kept his parents worried, frustrated, furious, or all three.  He skipped high school so often that his dad pulled him out of school; Brett later earned a GED degree. He hated rules, choosing to face consequences rather than forgo fun. Sometimes he lied, not because he was dishonest, Woehlk believed, but because he was irresponsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Saturday before he was killed, Brett skipped work to party. He made up an elaborate and later, an ironic lie: His cousin had been stabbed, he told his boss, and Brett was a suspect. He had to sit at the police station all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, April 1, the last day anyone saw him alive, Brett showed up for work at the Farm Stores on N Armenia about 6 p.m. He wore Levis, blue-and-whiteNiketennis shoes and a T-shirt with the words &quot;Farm Stores&quot; in the upper left shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a small black-and-white television. He liked to watch The Simpsons and other programs during work. He always took the television home with him, friends say, because he didn't want it stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store closed at midnight. Brett worked at least some of his 6 p.m. to midnight shift, according to friends who talked to him or saw him. But sometime that night, Brett left the store. Whether he finished the shift or left earlier is unknown. Whether he left on his own or was forced to is also unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the television was still in the store the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who reportedly last saw Brett at the store, and who has the most information about Sunday night, is David Mayle, the store manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle also is the man who was charged with Brett's murder and who wrote Mr. and Mrs. Woehlk a letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami Pipes, Brett's girlfriend, was worried when Brett didn't come home after work early Monday morning, April 2. The two had lived together on and off for the past several months. Jami called some close friends Brett often stayed with. He wasn't there. She drove by the store. He wasn't there. She checked with the Woehlks. They hadn't seen him, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, a Tampa Police Department detective knocked on Jami's door. The detective was looking for Brett.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Mayle, the detective told Jami, had reported a burglary from the store. About $ 10,000 had been stolen from the store, cash and rolled coins. Mayle told police Brett filled out deposit slips for Friday and Sunday, but the money never made it to the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, Jami was almost frantic. She told the detective Brett &quot;was missing.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, another Farm Stores employee, James DelValle, who walked to the store most days, called Jami.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just saw Brett's car,&quot; DelValle said. It was at Marquis Apartments, a few blocks from the Farm Stores. Jami went to see the car. The window of the 1983 yellow Toyota was down. A Sunday newspaper was partially opened and stashed in the back of the front seat. There was a pack of cigarettes, which police think were most likely Brett's, an uneaten sandwich and two Farm Stores bank bags.  The bags, which lock with a key, were open and empty. The key was at the Farm Stores, it was later determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jami knew Brett would never leave his car unlocked; it had an expensive stereo in it. And she still hadn't heard from him which was not like him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jim, Brett's dead,&quot; Jami said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nah, he's drinking Mai-Tai's in Hawaii,&quot; Jami remembers DelValle saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DelValle, also a friend of Brett's, had partied with Brett the Friday and Saturday nights before Brett disappeared. He told police and later testified in court that he did not remember seeing Brett take money or bank bags from the store Friday night and that Brett didn't have enough money Saturday to buy a pitcher of beer.  DelValle passed a police polygraph test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months later, DelValle accidentally shot himself. He died the next day, Nov. 24, 1990 Brett's birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next five days, Alan Woehlk and his wife, Phyllis, crept toward the realization that their son might be dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, they tried to tell themselves that Brett went to visit an old girlfriend in Texas. Then, though they did not think Brett would ever steal money, they started hoping he had, just to nurse the hope he was still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Brett's car was found, Alan Woehlk knew something was terribly wrong. By then, he had told the police his son was missing.  But police still suspected Brett had stolen the money. Woehlk pointed out that a guy who had just stolen $ 10,000 doesn't just leave his car like that with cigarettes, newspaper and sandwich. It didn't make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Brett had stolen the money, one of his friends would have known. Brett and his friends were tight-knit. Not one of them had seen Brett.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday afternoon, six days after Brett disappeared, police officers came to search the house for Brett, or for evidence he had stolen the money. I told you, Brett's not here, Woehlk said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, Alan and Phyllis Woehlk watched the 11 o'clock news, along with Alan's parents, Gus and Betty. They listened to the winning lottery numbers. Then they saw a field near Lowry Park. They heard a reporter say a boy looking for insects to feed his&nbsp; snake found a body instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Woehlks fell silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a brief look at the body. &quot;All they showed was a hand out from under a piece of carpet,&quot; Alan Woehlk recalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woehlk tried to stay calm. He called the television station. They had no more information. The next morning, Woehlk reached Detective George McNamara of the Tampa Police Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara asked what Brett had worn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi's,Niketennis shoes, Woehlk said. &quot;Is that what this person wore?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but that doesn't mean he's your son, McNamara replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I tried to tell him some distinguishing marks,&quot; Woehlk says. &quot;He said, &quot;You can forget that.' &quot; The body was badly decomposed and bloated. An autopsy would later indicate the person had been stabbed, his throat cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six days. In the sun. Under a carpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We knew it then.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective McNamara almost immediately suspected the store manager, David Mayle. It was common sense: Who had the safe combination? Only Brett and Mayle. Who was left to talk about it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle already had been fired by Farm Stores on April 6. Farm Stores refuses to discuss this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police reports say that Mayle told detectives he was fired because of a company investigation regarding money stolen from his store. A Farm Stores security officer also told police that the Farm Stores had noticed money shortages at Mayle's store about four months earlier. After Mayle was asked about the shortages, they stopped.  There is no indication Farm Stores took legal action against Mayle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when McNamara investigated the crime scene April 7, he had noticed two men watching from a car. He asked a police officer to get their names. At the time, the names didn't mean much:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Mayle and Paul Delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Delay, 34, has lived with Mayle for five years in what the couple describes as a homosexual relationship. On April 9, McNamara asked Mayle and Delay to come to police headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle told him his side of the story, which has remained unchanged since April. In a recent interview, he did the same:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scheduled to be at the Farm Stores Sunday night to help train Brett, recently promoted to assistant manager. Brett was to take charge during Mayle's upcoming vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the store closed at midnight that Sunday, Brett did all the paperwork for the bank deposit. He'd had trouble with it before.  Mayle checked it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He done good,&quot; Mayle says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mayle says, Brett left with one bank bag and the deposit slip, intending to make a night deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says he stayed at the store until about 2 a.m. He closed the store and then washed off his car's windshield. A police car stopped by, suspicious. Mayle waved, indicating he worked at the store. He stopped to buy a beer at a nearby 7-Eleven, and then went home, about a 20-minute drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says he was tired. He had worked a double shift Saturday, worked Sunday, then met Brett Sunday night and was due in at 4:30 a.m. Monday. He got home around 3 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Delay woke up, and the two argued about where Mayle had been. Mayle says (and Delay agrees) that Delay is compulsively jealous and had wondered whether Mayle and Brett were having an affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay went back to sleep. Mayle took a shower and changed clothes. If he tried to lie down, he would never get up again, he thought. He stopped at the same 7-Eleven for a cup of coffee and went to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett was scheduled off Monday. On Mayle's way home from work, he made a bank deposit. He did not pick up the weekend's verified deposits slips from the bank as he usually did because, he says, he was too tired. When he came to work Tuesday morning, the store was locked, but the safe was open and empty. He called the police and told them the money was gone. He said Brett was the only other person who knew the safe combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then McNamara interviewed Delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a 30-page report written by McNamara, Delay &quot;seemed very nervous . . . had a hard time making eye-to-eye contact&quot; and McNamara thought Delay &quot;was not telling us everything he knew about the disappearance of the subject, Brett Woehlk.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delay talked about the day he and Mayle stopped to watch the crime scene. He said Mayle, McNamara's report states, &quot;became quite upset and would not leave. . . . (he) was very intently watching the police officers at the crime scene.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said the couple barely made ends meet on about $ 1,600 a month, but that Mayle often cruised bar parking lots at night, bringing home money. McNamara asked Delay whether he &quot;actually believed&quot; Mayle had gotten extra money as much as $ 170 one night in parking lots, or whether he may have gotten it &quot;another way.&quot; Delay said he believed the money was found in the parking lots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detectives talked about Delay's jealousy, his belief that Mayle no longer loved him and had been having an affair with Brett. Delay cried and said he wanted to go home and &quot;confront David,&quot; McNamara wrote in his report.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 12, at 6 a.m., McNamara and other police officers showed up at&nbsp;Mayle's door with a warrant for his arrest. They charged him with burglary and grand theft. Searches turned up a bank bag (from a different Farm Stores) and rolled coins in his car. Police found nothing incriminating in his apartment, but they did take into evidence five sets of keys for Mayle's house and car and old bank bag keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara asked Delay to come back to the police station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at 8 a.m. Questioned for three hours by several detectives, Delay first said he didn't know anything, he didn't remember, then he wasn't sure. He wished they would stop asking him questions. He loved David very much and didn't want him to go to jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara and others pushed hard. They repeatedly encouraged Delay to &quot;be completely truthful.&quot; Little by little, Delay cracked, seeming less sure of what he had to say. He said Mayle went to bed for a while before returning to the store, contradicting Mayle's statement that he did not sleep. He was shown a photograph of Brett's stab-torn shirt, then a picture of the body. Had he ever seen dried blood before? Did David have dried blood on his hands that night?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I noticed red blood on his hands and questioned about why is the blood on your hands,&quot; Delay said in a taped statement a little after 11 a.m. &quot;He said that . . . that he was doing the parking lots and all and . . . you know . . . he already had his clothes off by the time I got in the bathroom and. . . .&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said Mayle told him &quot;he took Brett in his car, took him somewhere. I said, &quot;Where?' and he said, &quot;To that, to a lot.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay said Mayle told him he and Brett argued about the missing money. &quot;Brett wanted to keep the money, and David fought him for it.&quot; Mayle &quot;wanted money for himself, and David said he had to stab Brett and kill him. . . .&quot; Mayle was afraid Brett would go to the police. Mayle buried the knife near the body and asked Delay to bury his bloody clothes. Delay says he refused. Mayle left the house with the clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle was charged with first degree murder. But Delay soon retracted his statement. He later pleaded no contest to charges of perjury and accessory to murder, and was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years. (Although murder charges against Mayle were dropped, it is possible he is still under investigation. Police have refused to comment.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview Jan. 30 in the men's home, Delay trembled, and he never established eye contact. He says he is a diagnosed schizophrenic. (Psychiatrist James Fesler of Tampa confirms only that Delay is a patient; he says discussing a patient's diagnosis is inappropriate).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay says detectives fed him some details about the murder scene. Other details he already knew from newspaper articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was five detectives in the room with me,&quot; Delay says of the police interview. &quot;I was scared. And they knew my weakness.  Mentally, emotionally I can't take pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I went through hell. I don't know what I was saying. I was in a state of shock. I remember saying these things. That's why I turned around and misperjured myself. I knew it wasn't true. I know David's personality. I know he wouldn't do something like that.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked why he refused to establish eye contact during the interview with a reporter, his voice broke, and he stammered, &quot;I just . . . I don't like the whole idea. It hurts me.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grand jury refused to indict Mayle on murder charges after reviewing evidence, including Delay's then-retracted statement. In September, Mayle was quickly acquitted of theft by a six member jury. He never testified. Mayle left the courtroom that day in tears.  The Woehlks left discouraged and disgusted with the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police never found any buried knife or bloody clothes. Tests of brownish spots in Mayle's house and other items Mayle owned &quot;met with negative results,&quot; McNamara reported. No blood was found anywhere in Mayle's home or at the Farm Stores. Exactly where Brett was killed has never been determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk still believes Paul Delay knows something. He mentioned during his interrogation something about a set of keys he didn't recognize. They were among the keys police later took into evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the keys fit the lock at the Woehlks' house before they changed the lock after the murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle says there are simple explanations for events that might look suspicious. He says he did not steal money from Farm Stores.  He says Farm Stores wanted an excuse to get rid of him because he had had expensive health problems including back and foot surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who doesn't notice a marked crime scene crawling with police officers? He was just being &quot;nosy&quot; the day he stopped by the field where Brett's body was found. He and Delay had had dinner with friends, and their route took them by Lowry Park. The friends have confirmed this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If they have any keys other than mine, I don't know where they came from,&quot; Mayle says. He has many sets of keys, and Delay would not have recognized all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always carried rolled coins to supply the store, or others, if necessary, he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was seen (by Brett's watchful friends) with large amounts of cash after the murder, buying lottery tickets at convenience stores near his home. That, he says, was the money he had saved for vacation, about $ 3,000. He has no bank account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle thinks that police exploited Delay's insecurities, convincing him Mayle no longer cared for him. Mayle, who weighs approximately 350 pounds, says he believes his weight and his homosexuality did not help him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a victim of circumstance, he says. &quot;You know, you don't plan for things like that. You don't plan an alibi.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle, slow-moving, with a slightly brooding face, says his life has been ruined. He has lost his job, most of his friends and is nearly out of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says what has hurt the most is the way Farm Stores dumped him after nine years of service. Mayle had planned to work with Farm Stores until he retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he says, he cannot find a job. He works occasionally for temporary services companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been watched and called at all hours by Brett's young, angry friends, one of whom recently said of Mayle: &quot;I'd like to put an ice pick in the back of his head.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They was calling me and telling me when I was gettin' on the bus, when I was buying a loaf of bread,&quot; Mayle says. &quot;That makes you scared.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mayle says he has no plans to follow a friend's advice to leave Tampa. &quot;Why should I leave?&quot; he asks. Besides, &quot;If they're gonna do something, it don't matter where you go. So that's why I more or less stood and tried to fight it. I'm not really scared because, I don't know, I have a different thing about death, I guess. Death is a relief, okay? It relieves you of your pains, your misery. If I die, I die. To me, death would mean no more of it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Woehlk keeps channeling his grief into neat files and hard hopes. He has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Nov. 24, the Woehlks visited Brett's grave. It was his 22nd birthday. Several friends had sent flowers. One flower arrangement had no card. The Woehlks still don't know who sent it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rolex watch is still missing. It was stolen, along with Brett's wallet and keys, at the time Brett was killed. The watch is 22 years old, stainless steel, with a black face and small scratch. Woehlk says he would instantly recognize the watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has the feeling it will never be found.&nbsp;Chronology of events v&nbsp;v Sunday, April 1, 1990: Brett Woehlk shows up for work at the Farm Stores at 6 p.m., where David Mayle was to train him as an assistant manager.

Their names: David Mayle and Paul Delay, Mayle's companion of five years.Sunday, April 8: Woehlk calls the Tampa Police Department and describes what his son was wearing.

He was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years.",0.0290638915823,0.429181199723,"&nbsp;alan woehlk does not know for sure who murdered his son. he knows a man living not far from him was charged with the crime, and that the charges were dropped. he has a letter from him. the words are small, cramped, in black ink on yellow legal paper:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dear mr. and mrs. woehlk,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm sorry to hear what happened to brett. i wanted to go to the funeral, but couldn't. i had nothing to do with his death at all.  someday, i would like to talk with you both. maybe between us, we may be able to find out who did it or had it done. this has been hard for me. . . . and i know it must be hard on both of you. it has almost ruined my life, and for what.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope we can talk someday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alan woehlk (pronounced &quot;woke&quot;) keeps the letter in the neat manila folder he has compiled on his son's murder case. the file is thick, organized and incomplete, the way woehlk's life has been since his son, brett, 21, was found dead in a field near lowry park 11 months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it hurts woehlk that the murderer whether it is the man who wrote the letter or someone else is alive and free. he is confused about certain parts of the early police investigation and disappointed in the state attorney's prosecution of the alleged murderer, which was unsuccessful and left everything unsettled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woehlk, a stoic, disciplined, finish-the-job kind of man, is left with so many loose ends he even went to a psychic for answers. he lives with a fundamental imbalance: he cannot rest until brett's killer is behind bars, yet he knows that may never happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but perhaps worse than any of these things was the timing of brett's death. after years of open-faced conflict, woehlk and brett&nbsp; were finally getting along.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like many fathers and sons, they were at war from the time brett a wild, carefree and irresponsible kid was 14. and like many fathers and sons, as brett neared 20, miraculous realizations occurred on both sides of the barbed wire:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe dad's not so stupid after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe i've forgotten what i was like as a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they started doing things together: hunting, going to races, even surfing. woehlk, 43, had to laugh at himself. he wasn't much for surfing, but brett wanted to surf, so that's what they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the same time, brett started trusting adults, realizing he had to make his own way in the world. he was still wild and crazy, but there was progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woehlk was so pleased with his son that he gave brett his rolex watch. woehlk, sales manager at bolt and nut, had earned the watch as payment for a construction job many years before. it was very special to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave brett the watch on his 20th birthday. brett knew what the gift symbolized. he never took it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was not on brett's wrist when his body was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;brett woehlk who was most likely killed april 2 after leaving work at a farm stores convenience mart, autopsy reports say was handsome, cocky and friendly and intensely loyal to his friends. his hair was almost shoulder length, dark with a touch of red. he had a reddish-brown mustache, straight white teeth and beautiful green eyes framed by long lashes. he was 5-feet-6 inches tall, and weighed 135 pounds, but it was &quot;all muscle,&quot; his father says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brett had a way with women and took advantage of it. he was agile, a natural water skiier. he loved all water sports illustrated by the surfboard perched over his waterbed in his room. most of all he liked lounging on the beach. in the woehlk living room is a photo of brett sitting shirtless on the beach raising a beer and grinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;that was brett,&quot; alan woehlk says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alan woehlk knew his son was no angel. brett hung around with a tough crowd, basically good guys, but tough they drank, they partied, and woehlk suspected they used marijuana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brett, two years older than his only sibling, shannon, was the kind of kid who kept his parents worried, frustrated, furious, or all three.  he skipped high school so often that his dad pulled him out of school; brett later earned a ged degree. he hated rules, choosing to face consequences rather than forgo fun. sometimes he lied, not because he was dishonest, woehlk believed, but because he was irresponsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, the saturday before he was killed, brett skipped work to party. he made up an elaborate and later, an ironic lie: his cousin had been stabbed, he told his boss, and brett was a suspect. he had to sit at the police station all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on sunday, april 1, the last day anyone saw him alive, brett showed up for work at the farm stores on n armenia about 6 p.m. he wore levis, blue-and-whiteniketennis shoes and a t-shirt with the words &quot;farm stores&quot; in the upper left shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brought a small black-and-white television. he liked to watch the simpsons and other programs during work. he always took the television home with him, friends say, because he didn't want it stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the store closed at midnight. brett worked at least some of his 6 p.m. to midnight shift, according to friends who talked to him or saw him. but sometime that night, brett left the store. whether he finished the shift or left earlier is unknown. whether he left on his own or was forced to is also unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the television was still in the store the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the person who reportedly last saw brett at the store, and who has the most information about sunday night, is david mayle, the store manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle also is the man who was charged with brett's murder and who wrote mr. and mrs. woehlk a letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jami pipes, brett's girlfriend, was worried when brett didn't come home after work early monday morning, april 2. the two had lived together on and off for the past several months. jami called some close friends brett often stayed with. he wasn't there. she drove by the store. he wasn't there. she checked with the woehlks. they hadn't seen him, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on tuesday morning, a tampa police department detective knocked on jami's door. the detective was looking for brett.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;david mayle, the detective told jami, had reported a burglary from the store. about $ 10,000 had been stolen from the store, cash and rolled coins. mayle told police brett filled out deposit slips for friday and sunday, but the money never made it to the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by then, jami was almost frantic. she told the detective brett &quot;was missing.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next day, another farm stores employee, james delvalle, who walked to the store most days, called jami.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;i just saw brett's car,&quot; delvalle said. it was at marquis apartments, a few blocks from the farm stores. jami went to see the car. the window of the 1983 yellow toyota was down. a sunday newspaper was partially opened and stashed in the back of the front seat. there was a pack of cigarettes, which police think were most likely brett's, an uneaten sandwich and two farm stores bank bags.  the bags, which lock with a key, were open and empty. the key was at the farm stores, it was later determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jami knew brett would never leave his car unlocked; it had an expensive stereo in it. and she still hadn't heard from him which was not like him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;jim, brett's dead,&quot; jami said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;nah, he's drinking mai-tai's in hawaii,&quot; jami remembers delvalle saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delvalle, also a friend of brett's, had partied with brett the friday and saturday nights before brett disappeared. he told police and later testified in court that he did not remember seeing brett take money or bank bags from the store friday night and that brett didn't have enough money saturday to buy a pitcher of beer.  delvalle passed a police polygraph test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months later, delvalle accidentally shot himself. he died the next day, nov. 24, 1990 brett's birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the next five days, alan woehlk and his wife, phyllis, crept toward the realization that their son might be dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at first, they tried to tell themselves that brett went to visit an old girlfriend in texas. then, though they did not think brett would ever steal money, they started hoping he had, just to nurse the hope he was still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when brett's car was found, alan woehlk knew something was terribly wrong. by then, he had told the police his son was missing.  but police still suspected brett had stolen the money. woehlk pointed out that a guy who had just stolen $ 10,000 doesn't just leave his car like that with cigarettes, newspaper and sandwich. it didn't make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if brett had stolen the money, one of his friends would have known. brett and his friends were tight-knit. not one of them had seen brett.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on saturday afternoon, six days after brett disappeared, police officers came to search the house for brett, or for evidence he had stolen the money. i told you, brett's not here, woehlk said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;later that night, alan and phyllis woehlk watched the 11 o'clock news, along with alan's parents, gus and betty. they listened to the winning lottery numbers. then they saw a field near lowry park. they heard a reporter say a boy looking for insects to feed his&nbsp; snake found a body instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;the woehlks fell silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a brief look at the body. &quot;all they showed was a hand out from under a piece of carpet,&quot; alan woehlk recalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woehlk tried to stay calm. he called the television station. they had no more information. the next morning, woehlk reached detective george mcnamara of the tampa police department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mcnamara asked what brett had worn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;levi's,niketennis shoes, woehlk said. &quot;is that what this person wore?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, but that doesn't mean he's your son, mcnamara replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;i tried to tell him some distinguishing marks,&quot; woehlk says. &quot;he said, &quot;you can forget that.' &quot; the body was badly decomposed and bloated. an autopsy would later indicate the person had been stabbed, his throat cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six days. in the sun. under a carpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;we knew it then.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detective mcnamara almost immediately suspected the store manager, david mayle. it was common sense: who had the safe combination? only brett and mayle. who was left to talk about it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle already had been fired by farm stores on april 6. farm stores refuses to discuss this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police reports say that mayle told detectives he was fired because of a company investigation regarding money stolen from his store. a farm stores security officer also told police that the farm stores had noticed money shortages at mayle's store about four months earlier. after mayle was asked about the shortages, they stopped.  there is no indication farm stores took legal action against mayle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, when mcnamara investigated the crime scene april 7, he had noticed two men watching from a car. he asked a police officer to get their names. at the time, the names didn't mean much:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;david mayle and paul delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paul delay, 34, has lived with mayle for five years in what the couple describes as a homosexual relationship. on april 9, mcnamara asked mayle and delay to come to police headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle told him his side of the story, which has remained unchanged since april. in a recent interview, he did the same:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was scheduled to be at the farm stores sunday night to help train brett, recently promoted to assistant manager. brett was to take charge during mayle's upcoming vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the store closed at midnight that sunday, brett did all the paperwork for the bank deposit. he'd had trouble with it before.  mayle checked it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;he done good,&quot; mayle says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then, mayle says, brett left with one bank bag and the deposit slip, intending to make a night deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle says he stayed at the store until about 2 a.m. he closed the store and then washed off his car's windshield. a police car stopped by, suspicious. mayle waved, indicating he worked at the store. he stopped to buy a beer at a nearby 7-eleven, and then went home, about a 20-minute drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle says he was tired. he had worked a double shift saturday, worked sunday, then met brett sunday night and was due in at 4:30 a.m. monday. he got home around 3 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paul delay woke up, and the two argued about where mayle had been. mayle says (and delay agrees) that delay is compulsively jealous and had wondered whether mayle and brett were having an affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay went back to sleep. mayle took a shower and changed clothes. if he tried to lie down, he would never get up again, he thought. he stopped at the same 7-eleven for a cup of coffee and went to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brett was scheduled off monday. on mayle's way home from work, he made a bank deposit. he did not pick up the weekend's verified deposits slips from the bank as he usually did because, he says, he was too tired. when he came to work tuesday morning, the store was locked, but the safe was open and empty. he called the police and told them the money was gone. he said brett was the only other person who knew the safe combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then mcnamara interviewed delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to a 30-page report written by mcnamara, delay &quot;seemed very nervous . . . had a hard time making eye-to-eye contact&quot; and mcnamara thought delay &quot;was not telling us everything he knew about the disappearance of the subject, brett woehlk.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delay talked about the day he and mayle stopped to watch the crime scene. he said mayle, mcnamara's report states, &quot;became quite upset and would not leave. . . . (he) was very intently watching the police officers at the crime scene.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay said the couple barely made ends meet on about $ 1,600 a month, but that mayle often cruised bar parking lots at night, bringing home money. mcnamara asked delay whether he &quot;actually believed&quot; mayle had gotten extra money as much as $ 170 one night in parking lots, or whether he may have gotten it &quot;another way.&quot; delay said he believed the money was found in the parking lots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the detectives talked about delay's jealousy, his belief that mayle no longer loved him and had been having an affair with brett. delay cried and said he wanted to go home and &quot;confront david,&quot; mcnamara wrote in his report.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on april 12, at 6 a.m., mcnamara and other police officers showed up at&nbsp;mayle's door with a warrant for his arrest. they charged him with burglary and grand theft. searches turned up a bank bag (from a different farm stores) and rolled coins in his car. police found nothing incriminating in his apartment, but they did take into evidence five sets of keys for mayle's house and car and old bank bag keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mcnamara asked delay to come back to the police station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he arrived at 8 a.m. questioned for three hours by several detectives, delay first said he didn't know anything, he didn't remember, then he wasn't sure. he wished they would stop asking him questions. he loved david very much and didn't want him to go to jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mcnamara and others pushed hard. they repeatedly encouraged delay to &quot;be completely truthful.&quot; little by little, delay cracked, seeming less sure of what he had to say. he said mayle went to bed for a while before returning to the store, contradicting mayle's statement that he did not sleep. he was shown a photograph of brett's stab-torn shirt, then a picture of the body. had he ever seen dried blood before? did david have dried blood on his hands that night?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;i noticed red blood on his hands and questioned about why is the blood on your hands,&quot; delay said in a taped statement a little after 11 a.m. &quot;he said that . . . that he was doing the parking lots and all and . . . you know . . . he already had his clothes off by the time i got in the bathroom and. . . .&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay said mayle told him &quot;he took brett in his car, took him somewhere. i said, &quot;where?' and he said, &quot;to that, to a lot.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay said mayle told him he and brett argued about the missing money. &quot;brett wanted to keep the money, and david fought him for it.&quot; mayle &quot;wanted money for himself, and david said he had to stab brett and kill him. . . .&quot; mayle was afraid brett would go to the police. mayle buried the knife near the body and asked delay to bury his bloody clothes. delay says he refused. mayle left the house with the clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle was charged with first degree murder. but delay soon retracted his statement. he later pleaded no contest to charges of perjury and accessory to murder, and was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years. (although murder charges against mayle were dropped, it is possible he is still under investigation. police have refused to comment.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an interview jan. 30 in the men's home, delay trembled, and he never established eye contact. he says he is a diagnosed schizophrenic. (psychiatrist james fesler of tampa confirms only that delay is a patient; he says discussing a patient's diagnosis is inappropriate).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay says detectives fed him some details about the murder scene. other details he already knew from newspaper articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;it was five detectives in the room with me,&quot; delay says of the police interview. &quot;i was scared. and they knew my weakness.  mentally, emotionally i can't take pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;i went through hell. i don't know what i was saying. i was in a state of shock. i remember saying these things. that's why i turned around and misperjured myself. i knew it wasn't true. i know david's personality. i know he wouldn't do something like that.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when asked why he refused to establish eye contact during the interview with a reporter, his voice broke, and he stammered, &quot;i just . . . i don't like the whole idea. it hurts me.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a grand jury refused to indict mayle on murder charges after reviewing evidence, including delay's then-retracted statement. in september, mayle was quickly acquitted of theft by a six member jury. he never testified. mayle left the courtroom that day in tears.  the woehlks left discouraged and disgusted with the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; police never found any buried knife or bloody clothes. tests of brownish spots in mayle's house and other items mayle owned &quot;met with negative results,&quot; mcnamara reported. no blood was found anywhere in mayle's home or at the farm stores. exactly where brett was killed has never been determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alan woehlk still believes paul delay knows something. he mentioned during his interrogation something about a set of keys he didn't recognize. they were among the keys police later took into evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the keys fit the lock at the woehlks' house before they changed the lock after the murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle says there are simple explanations for events that might look suspicious. he says he did not steal money from farm stores.  he says farm stores wanted an excuse to get rid of him because he had had expensive health problems including back and foot surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who doesn't notice a marked crime scene crawling with police officers? he was just being &quot;nosy&quot; the day he stopped by the field where brett's body was found. he and delay had had dinner with friends, and their route took them by lowry park. the friends have confirmed this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;if they have any keys other than mine, i don't know where they came from,&quot; mayle says. he has many sets of keys, and delay would not have recognized all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he always carried rolled coins to supply the store, or others, if necessary, he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was seen (by brett's watchful friends) with large amounts of cash after the murder, buying lottery tickets at convenience stores near his home. that, he says, was the money he had saved for vacation, about $ 3,000. he has no bank account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle thinks that police exploited delay's insecurities, convincing him mayle no longer cared for him. mayle, who weighs approximately 350 pounds, says he believes his weight and his homosexuality did not help him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is a victim of circumstance, he says. &quot;you know, you don't plan for things like that. you don't plan an alibi.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayle, slow-moving, with a slightly brooding face, says his life has been ruined. he has lost his job, most of his friends and is nearly out of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he says what has hurt the most is the way farm stores dumped him after nine years of service. mayle had planned to work with farm stores until he retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, he says, he cannot find a job. he works occasionally for temporary services companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has been watched and called at all hours by brett's young, angry friends, one of whom recently said of mayle: &quot;i'd like to put an ice pick in the back of his head.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;they was calling me and telling me when i was gettin' on the bus, when i was buying a loaf of bread,&quot; mayle says. &quot;that makes you scared.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but mayle says he has no plans to follow a friend's advice to leave tampa. &quot;why should i leave?&quot; he asks. besides, &quot;if they're gonna do something, it don't matter where you go. so that's why i more or less stood and tried to fight it. i'm not really scared because, i don't know, i have a different thing about death, i guess. death is a relief, okay? it relieves you of your pains, your misery. if i die, i die. to me, death would mean no more of it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alan woehlk keeps channeling his grief into neat files and hard hopes. he has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on nov. 24, the woehlks visited brett's grave. it was his 22nd birthday. several friends had sent flowers. one flower arrangement had no card. the woehlks still don't know who sent it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rolex watch is still missing. it was stolen, along with brett's wallet and keys, at the time brett was killed. the watch is 22 years old, stainless steel, with a black face and small scratch. woehlk says he would instantly recognize the watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he has the feeling it will never be found.&nbsp;chronology of events v&nbsp;v sunday, april 1, 1990: brett woehlk shows up for work at the farm stores at 6 p.m., where david mayle was to train him as an assistant manager. it was the last day he was seen alive.monday, april 2: police say this is probably the day brett was killed. his girlfriend, jami pipes, grows concerned when brett doesn't come home.tuesday, april 3: a detective shows up at jami's looking for brett.  he is investigating a report of missing money from the farm stores where brett worked. mayle has reported the money missing.wednesday, april 4: another farm stores employee, james delvalle, who walked to the store most days, calls jami and reports he has seen brett's car in the parking lot of some apartments.  delvalle had partied with brett on friday and saturday before he disappeared.friday, april 6: david mayle is fired by farm stores. mayle tells detectives he was fired because of a company investigation regarding money stolen from his store.saturday, april 7: police officers come to search alan woehlk's house for brett. later that night, a television report says that a body has been found in a field near lowry park. woehlk, suspecting it might be brett, tries to get more information from the television station, but none is available. also that day, as detective george mcnamara is investigating the crime scene, he notices two men watching from a car. their names: david mayle and paul delay, mayle's companion of five years.sunday, april 8: woehlk calls the tampa police department and describes what his son was wearing. even though detective mcnamara says he can't be sure it's brett, woehlk is sure it is his son.monday, april 9: mcnamara asks mayle and delay to come to police headquarters, where they give their version of the events.thursday, april 12: mcnamara and other police officers show up at mayle's door with a warrant for his arrest. they charge him with grand theft. he is never indicted on murder charges.september: mayle is quickly acquitted of theft by a six-member jury. delay had already pleaded no contest to perjury and accessory to murder. he was sentenced to 20 years' probation, to be served concurrently over five years.",Nike'sprint ads,"November 18, 1991 Monday",474 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

Also, recovery time: muscle fibers don't recover from workouts as fast as with younger runners.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun Run: Lisa Vaill, 28, of Brooksville, was third overall in a field of 175 at Saturday's Sun Run in Spring Hill.

"&nbsp;It is the voice that is surprising soft, slurry, a half-asleep whisper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Black people kissing on screen? I never saw that growing up.&quot; He says this staring out the editing booth watching a print of his new film, Jungle Fever, run over and over, the images of a black man and a white woman reflected in his glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a performance a mastery of the deadpan as he has put it as integral to the Spike Lee persona as the wire-rims, a baseball cap and sneaker. Behind the glasses, his eyes are enormous, impassive.  His body, a spindly afterthought ending in the soft padding of hisNikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The intermingling of the races? That's always going to be a part of my work,&quot; says the country's pre-eminent black American film-maker, staring at the screen in a sound stage at Manhattan's storied Brill Building. &quot;That has happened since the slaves were brought here stolen from Africa when massa started sneaking in the slave quarters at night. That's the dynamics of color and race.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently watches a few more frames. Suddenly he throws his head back and laughs, a short, raucous burst. &quot;There's one thing that black men have that really threatens white males.&quot; To paraphrase Lee, it is the notion of a black male's sexual prowess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask anyone who knows him and to a man they will tell you, Spike Lee is a troublemaker. His films She's Gotta Have It (1986), School Daze (1988), Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990) and now, Jungle Fever, the much anticipated look at interracial romance that opens Friday have been sharp, repeated blows to the Hollywood axiom that black doesn't sell. Not in white America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the director's works black American cultural themes married to a cinematic style drawn from Martin Scorsese, Japan's Akira Kurasowa and the French New Wave filmmakers has made money. And each has generated equal currency from the media that addresses Lee's films as annual missives from the front lines of cultural politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Do the Right Thing opened two summers ago an examination of racism in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood that seemed to advocate violence as a means of social reform the movie generated segments on Nightline and several evening newscasts when critics and civic leaders predicted the film would spark riots. For every reviewer like Vincent Canby of the New York Times who hails Lee's work as &quot;social phenomena&quot; from &quot;a major American filmmaker in dazzling command of his craft&quot; there are those who consider him simply &quot;an annual media sensation,&quot; as Time's Richard Schickel has written.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is the most influential black American director working in Hollywood today, one who is making his movies, albeit low-budget by most studio standards, on his terms. His films have expanded the boundaries of the country's popular culture, altered Hollywood's perception of crossover audiences, and opened the door for a new generation of black American male directors the Hudlin Brothers, Robert Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Bill Duke among them who are redefining the roles that African-Americans play on screen and within the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is he so successful? How about &quot;He is really talented, a good filmmaker,' &quot; says Tom Pollock, chairman of MCA Motion Picture Group where Lee has made his last three films under an unusual picture-by-picture arrangement that grants him total artistic control. &quot;He is a serious filmmaker no different from where Scorsese was after five films.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African-American studies at Harvard University, calls Lee &quot;one of the most important figures in African-American culture. He is doing what nobody has done in film depicting what W. E.B. Dubois called &quot;the life behind the veil,' what black people do when white people aren't around.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee suggests that &quot;it's a combination of everything part talent, part luck, part timing. I'm not the first talented black filmmaker to appear on the face of the earth. If I had come along 20 years ago, the conditions weren't conducive to this kind of success.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, he is not the first significant African-American director.  Melvin Van Peebles, Gordon Parks, even actor Sidney Poitier are among those who predate Lee by a generation or two. Now, the Brooklyn-based director is one of several talented black American directors Hollywood is courting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 34 and with five films to his credit, Lee has become something of the group's power base; he remains the first to employ what some have called &quot;a post-integration sensibility&quot; one who is not making films to simply uplift the race.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dozens of black Americans have directed films before,&quot; says Roger Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times. &quot;But the subtext of those movies was always how blacks related to whites. Spike broke through that. He defines blacks in relation to other blacks.  That is brand new.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even critics who dislike his artistry agree that Lee, a graduate of Atlanta's Morehouse College and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, is the first director to package parochial racial themes and issues delineating economic, gender and class distinctions that segment of life between The Cosby Show and the crack houses in a commercially viable vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's Gotta Have It, Lee's first feature film, shot for $ 175,000 in 16mm, explored sexuality from the unusual perspective of a liberated black American woman. School Daze probed such seldom-discussed intraracial issues as the clash between light-skinned and dark-skinned black Americans. Do the Right Thing exhumed racial bigotry and class hatred among New York's underclass. Mo' Better Blues&nbsp;chronicled the lives of middle-class jazz musicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Jungle Fever, which features Wesley Snipes, Anthony Quinn and Annabella Sciorra, explores interracial relationships. Some critics are already speculating that the film, which is dedicated to Yusuf Hawkins, the black youth murdered by a gang of whites in New York two years ago, could prove as controversial as Do the Right Thing. Meanwhile, Lee is already in pre-production on his most ambitious film to date the coveted Malcolm X project, a film about the black nationalist leader, with a budget that may reach $ 30-million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions, however, that Lee's standing within the film industry and the black American community is due less to his talents as a moviemaker than his shrewd entrepreneurial instincts and acute political sensibilities that embody, more than any other African-American director, the country's interest in racial issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee's cultural politics, evident in his films and frequent public statements he once described himself as &quot;a black Nationalist with a movie camera&quot; have capitalized on the growing appreciation of Malcolm X, earned the support of such divergent political leaders as Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan and captured much of the public outrage voiced after recent racial incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee has firmly positioned his career at that thorny crossroads of art and publicity and his off-screen activities have earned him almost as much note as his films. An outspoken social critic, Lee has publicly attacked Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and Quincy Jones as sellout crossover artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He criticized several Hollywood directors, including Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood, for making films about black Americans. He called Edward Koch, then mayor of New York City, a &quot;racist&quot; and said he hoped Do the Right Thing would defeat his bid for re-election. When the film lost at Cannes that year, he accused the festival jury of racism, and when he lost out in May to the unheralded Barton Fink directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, he vowed never to return to the festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee has buttressed his pronouncements with growing financial clout. He is the only black American filmmaker to mass-market himself the way entertainers such as Eddie Murphy, Prince and Michael Jackson have.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his film company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Lee owns Spike's Joint, a lucrative retail and a mail-order business that merchandises books, tapes, T-shirts and other apparel related to his films.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you don't own stuff you have no power,&quot; says Lee. &quot;For me that's the whole issue. When black people start thinking more like entrepreneurs instead of just consumers, then we will have a whole lot more empowerment. Instead of &quot;Please Mr. White Man, can you do so and so for me,' we will call the shots.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for every critic or studio head who hails Lee as a genuine pioneer, there are those who insist he is neither a talented filmmaker nor a serious social critic, that the racial and economic situations of his films are exploitative particularly of African-American women and the film's political positions are undercut by a fatal, commercial-driven, ambiguity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been called a huckster by some critics and artists both black and white Americans who attribute his success to his low-budget &quot;boutique&quot; standing within Hollywood and the indulgence of a predominantly white media. Others have labeled Lee simply a charlatan, the &quot;Al Sharpton of filmmaking&quot; says Time's Schickel, one who exploits social issues for his own ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the African-American critical community is divided over Lee's work. While Dr. Henry Louis Gates, the country's preeminent black American scholar, finds the director a pivotal figure in American culture, Stanley Crouch, the well-known Village Voice critic, has dismissed Lee as a &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;propagandist&quot; without &quot;the courage and will to give racial confrontation true dramatic complexity.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other critics suggest that Lee is falling victim to his own success.  &quot;He is dealing with more significant issues than other black filmmakers,&quot; says Jackie Jones, editor of the Black Film Review.  &quot;But the way he has been packaged as a phenomena, it is discouraging real critical discussion of his films.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One cannot deny that Spike has made a fantastic breakthrough in an all-white enclave. There is no question of that,&quot; adds Jack Kroll, Newsweek's senior critic. &quot;But there is a part of him that is an opportunist, that prevents you from taking him seriously as a true radical. Many black artists look upon Spike with very mixed feelings.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, interviews with dozens of colleagues, employees and friends, past and present, reveal a man who generates some of the same charges of exploitation in his professional and personal relationships, that for all his success at the box office, Lee's standing within the black American film community is several notches below other, less-influential directors such as Robert Townsend, a much-liked Hollywood director.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several producers, actors and investors who have worked with and for Lee say that the entrepreneurial shrewdness shown in his dealings with those more powerful than himself has not translated into any trickle-down system for his peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suggest that after six years in the business, Lee has become arrogant, self-interested, a multimillionaire who under pays artists and employees, and that for all his public support of a new black economic solidarity the director has simply co-opted traditional studio-boss attitudes a vision extending only to his own pocketbook. The most powerful African-American in Hollywood may be the most resented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spike's single-mindedness is his best and his worst quality,&quot; says Nelson George, a screenwriter, music critic and columnist for the Village Voice and one of Lee's original backers. &quot;He tunnel-visions people out when he doesn't need them and he has not been as visionary as he could be in helping other people's careers.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee, who still lives and works in the same Brooklyn neighborhood where he was raised, is unfazed by the criticism. &quot;I have no conflicts at all, about my success. None,&quot; he says. &quot;Black people should be the recipients of the money that is being generated by black culture.  In the past we were getting flim-flammed, bamboozled. Having talent is not enough. You have to know about royalties. You have to have some business know-how.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee comes across as a complex, driven man who seems to enjoy revealing as little of himself as possible. Friends say that for all his public posturing, he is notoriously shy, a work-obsessed artist who spends hours on the phone, lives alone in his Fort Greene townhouse furnished with a giant editing machine just blocks from his office and the house where he grew up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He punctuates his short-take answers with long silent stares, what some call &quot;Spike's game face.&quot; He seldom smiles, occasionally breaks into laughter at some private joke. More frequently, he interrupts the proceedings to consult with his crew and return phone calls from a stack of messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee attributes his strong self-image to his own family upbringing.  &quot;In the '30s and the '40s my grandmother was coloring birthday cards, Christmas cards, my mother's dolls with brown magic marker,&quot; he says. &quot;That's how our family was raised. It was a conscious effort on my grandmother's part who did not want her children and grandchildren growing up thinking black was ugly.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born Shelton Jackson Lee in Atlanta, March 20, 1957, the oldest of five children of William and Jacquelyn Lee, a jazz musician and a schoolteacher. The nickname Spike was his mother's doing, &quot;because she said I was a tough baby,&quot; says Lee. By all accounts, the tough baby grew into a shy child, &quot;an exceptionally quiet little boy who liked reading and sports,&quot; recalls his grandmother, Zimmie Shelton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the family soon migrated to Chicago and then New York, because of those cities' burgeoning jazz scenes, Lee spent his summers in the South dividing his time between grandparents the Sheltons of Atlanta and the Lees of Montgomery Ala., where his grandfather, a disciple of Booker T. Washington, had founded the Snow Hill Institute, a private school modeled on the Tuskeegee Institute. In Brooklyn, Lee attended St. Ann's, a private school where his mother taught, and later the John Dewey High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Jacquelyn Lee largely supported the family for several years after Lee's father, something of a jazz purist, saw his career suffer when he refused to play electronic rather than acoustic instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the reasons I became a filmmaker was because I was brought up in a very artistic household,&quot; says Lee, who has employed his father as a musician, his sisters Joie and Cinque as actors and his brother David as a photographer. (His brother Chris runs Lee's mail-order business.) &quot;My father was a great jazz musician and my mother taught art. Filmmaking can comprise a lot of those arts.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he enrolled at Atlanta's Morehouse College, the highly regarded black men's college where his father and grandfather had attended, Lee was considered a loner and a leader who took his cues from his close-knit family rather than his peers. He had only a handful of close friends, including Monty Ross who would later become his co-producer, and spent every weekend at the home of his grandmother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was always very secretive and not particularly popular,&quot; recalls Zimmie Shelton. &quot;Spike was short, he didn't have a car and he ate every meal at my house. But he wanted to be a winner and he would work himself to a frazzle.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his sophomore year, two seminal events had occurred in Lee's life his mother, with whom he was very close, died of liver cancer, and he bought his first movie camera. Friends say Lee never mentioned his mother's death for months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the camera, Lee's says &quot;I can't remember why I decided to buy that Super-8. My mother had taken me to lots of films when I was growing up, but it's not like a lot of filmmakers, you know, &quot;My parents took me to see Bambi when I was 4 years old and I wanted to be a filmmaker ever since.' It was more of an acquired taste for me.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Lee seems in it for the long haul, a single-minded entrepreneur who still rides the subway, still wears his low-rent wardrobe, but who pursues an ambitious vision financial&nbsp;ideological and artistic. He is currently renovating one of the three buildings he owns in Brooklyn to create his own screening, editing and recording facilities for his film and record divisions. He has a busy and lucrative side career, like many directors, shooting music videos for such artists as Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder and Prince.  And he continues to make commercials forNike,Levi-Straus and Diet Coke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask his friends what drives the director, even those who have quarreled with him, they say his obsession with his career has less to do with money or fame although he enjoys both, than it has to do with a desire for respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee pauses in a moment of rare reflection at the end of a long afternoon and interview session. &quot;People are co-opted who want to be co-opted,&quot; he says. &quot;People who have power never give it up voluntarily. You never stop working toward that goal. Some say this country will never stop being racist, well that doesn't mean you throw up your hands. You acquire your own power, taking away other people's power over you. That's just taking back what should have been yours anyway.&quot;",0.0935181405896,0.429386479592,2939 words,Nike'sprint ads,"May 9, 1991 Thursday",477 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;It was business as usual at last Friday night's Radisson Sundown 5K on the beach at Clearwater's Sand Key Park: Dror Vaknin of USF coasted to an easy win, tuning up for today's (Thursday) Peachtree Classic in Atlanta, and Heather Dawson of St. Petersburg won for the second time in the series by more than two minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawson's time was 18:35, good for eighth place in the field of 150; Vaknin cruised in at 16:16 on the all-sand surface in what he described as a &quot;tempo&quot; run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the masters winner age 40 and over was unusual, however. Sixty-year-old Jack Gough of St. Petersburg, a national-class runner in his age division, was first in 19:30, 16th overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gough, who clocked 17:06 for 5K eight years ago, finds himself in a Catch-22 situation.&nbsp;&quot;I'm just not into it like I once was,&quot; said Gough, who stands 6-1 and weighs between 160 and 165. &quot;If I work myself into top shape, I'm more motivated to compete. But when I train too much or too hard I come down with muscle injuries that hurt my motivation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago Gough won national age group titles at 10 miles (59:30) at Raleigh, N.C., and at Naples over 8K (4.97 miles) in 29:18, beating his arch-rival, Jim Blount of Orlando. However, Blount beat him at the recent Bay-to-Bay race across First Avenue South in St. Petersburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gough claims the only reason he runs is to stay in shape: &quot;I used to play tennis, but then the courts got crowded. Then I took up golf and we had to ride instead of walk. So I took up bicycling until one day when I was going past Azelea Middle School and saw someone running, so I got off my bike and managed to run a lap.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there the Dayton, Ohio, native who didn't compete in high school or college started competing in local road races. At age 50, Gough clocked 34:58 for 10K and a year later at Gasparilla ran 15K in 53:46, both personal records. His marathon PR came at the British-American Marathon across the Gandy at age 52, a 2:49:35 effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gough averages seven miles a day, mostly in and around Veterans Memorial Park at Bay Pines. Late last year he was laid off as a mechanical design engineer by Honeywell in Clearwater. &quot;I have more time to train now,&quot; Gough said. &quot;I'd like to start doing double sessions, running twice a day.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine State Games: Frank Shorter, Olympic marathon gold medalist in 1972, will be in Tampa next Thursday, July 11, in connection with the Sunshine States Games at Bradenton, which begin on July 12.

Shorter's marathon win at Munich, the first by an American in 64 years, was recently voted as the greatest moment in U.S. marathon history by more than 50 running journalists in the United States.

"&nbsp;Last year's prized Pinellas County football recruit was Greg Frey of Clearwater High. This year, the name Brian Magee is on everyone's lips and on everyone's list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magee is appearing on all the preseason football recruiting lists.  Just like Frey, an offensive lineman who signed last year with Florida State, Largo High's Magee is being mentioned as one of the nation's top prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to scouting publications, like SuperPrep, Tom Lemming's Prep Football, and The Blue Chip Report, Magee is among the top 100 seniors in the nation. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound athlete is listed as a defensive back but can play other positions well a reason why the explosive Magee was the Times' Player of the Year in 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magee is not alone in the spotlight. Countryside High defensive lineman Jeff Mitchell (6-4, 250) is on the SuperPrep list and, along with Magee, is named in Street &amp; Smith magazine as one of country's best seniors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orlando-based Bill Buchalter's Scouting Report has Magee and Mitchell among the top 24 players in Florida. On the publication's expanded state list, Tarpon Springs' Kevin Reid is mentioned as one of the top 14 senior quarterbacks, teammate Israel Carr as one of the 13 best senior receivers, and East Lake's Scott Kadlub (6-1, 275) among the 17 best offensive linemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're counting, there are 18 days until high school practice begins, on Aug. 15. The county jamborees are Sept. 6. (Please see schedule in For the Record.) The season begins Sept. 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck, LaPorta join Spongers: Tarpon Springs High bolstered its coaching staff for this fall. Former Pinellas Park head football coach Bruce Buck has joined George Werner's staff as an assistant (he will be fine-tuning the talent of quarterback Reid), and Gibbs High head track and assistant football coach Tom LaPorta has transferred to Tarpon. He will lead the junior varsity football program and replace Gary Jones as the girls track coach. Jones replaces Jack Thompson, who resigned, as softball coach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck coached Pinellas Park for nine years before resigning in 1990, taking a one-year leave of absence from teaching. &quot;I found out I really do want to teach and coach,&quot; Buck said recently. He will teach math at Tarpon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LaPorta's departure leaves another vacancy at Gibbs, which already is looking for a baseball coach. Of course, isn't everybody looking for a baseball coach, what with openings at Gibbs, Lakewood, Boca Ciega and Largo?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading way out of town: During the school year, their road trips might take them across town or into another county. But groups of baseball and basketball players are making big trips this summer to Australia, Ireland and Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contingent from Upper Pinellas International Baseball left today for Australia the group's fourth trip since it was formed, in 1986. The previous ventures were to Japan, Germany and Canada.  Dunedin High coach Greg Nichols, who formed the UPIB, again is coaching the team. His squad consists of players from four high schools, including six incoming freshman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have a good team, although we do have some young players,&quot; said Nichols, whose group will play in the Great Barrier Reef Tournament Aug. 2-4 in Cairns, then play exhibitions in Brisbane and Sydney before heading home Aug. 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several basketball teams are heading to Ireland to play in the Emerald Cup, in Limerick Aug. 4-11. Two of the girls teams (18-and-under and 16-and-under) are being coached by former Clearwater High coach Mike Kessenger and Countryside High coach John Napoli. The teams consist of players from Clearwater, Countryside and East Lake. Two Tampa teams also include Pinellas players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another girls basketball team, coached by Clearwater Central Catholic coach Dean Soles, is heading to Canada. Soles, who brought a team to the U.S.S.R. and Finland last year, is coaching a group consisting mainly of CCC players. The squad will play games in the U.S. along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For team rosters, please see For The Record.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't touch him: A recent Sports Illustrated story featured prestigious summer camps for high school basketball players $ including theNikebasketball camp (about 120 participants), conducted earlier this month in Indianapolis. Throngs of college coaches crowd such exclusive camps, keeping informal contact with prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coaches need not bother with Dixie Hollins' Dametri Hill, the only Pinellas County player at theNikecamp. Hill, 6-7, 260 pounds, and the leading scorer in Pinellas (25.9-point average) last season, made an oral commitment to the University of Florida in April.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill is playing this week in the AAU Junior Olympics in Tallahassee, with several other area players, under the direction of Pinellas Park High coach Pat Healy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget cuts: Pinellas County sports schedules will be shortened this year (except for varsity football) in an effort to save money.  Pinellas is not alone. Hillsborough County is proposing cuts to save about $ 150,000. Among the proposals: cutting one game from every schedule except in varsity football, eliminating spring football jamborees, canceling junior high championships, and cutting travel money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These are hard times for everybody,&quot; Valrico Bloomingdale football coach Bobby Bennett said. &quot;Eliminating the spring jamboree is better than eliminating spring football.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the country: Football coach Jan R. Smith, who won three Utah state championships despite having multiple sclerosis, died this month from complications of the disease. He was 41. The former Brigham Young University back led Morgan High to titles in 1977, 1979 and 1983. Smith, who last coached in 1987, roamed the sidelines in a golf cart, his voice softened to a whisper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a hot prospect signs with a university and shows up at campus doesn't mean he will play. University of Texas redshirt quarterback Steve Clements, Texas' all-time leading high school passer, plans to transfer from Texas to Brigham Young because he is listed third on the Longhorns' depth chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother called him &quot;a party-party, fun-type kid,&quot; but Chad Hughes, an Arizona state wrestling champion from Scottsdale, overdid matters Memorial Day weekend. To celebrate his upcoming graduation, Hughes, 18, was drinking and performing back flips among a crowd of 400 in a Mexican bar. On one flip attempt, he landed on his head, severed his spinal cord, and cracked his skull.  He died 90 minutes later, of a heart attack.Information from correspondent Jim Tomlin and the Associated Press was used in this column.",0.10619047619,0.344226190476,1124 words,Nike'sprint ads,"March 17, 1991 Sunday",480 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;Question: How come baseball coaches wear baseball caps but football coaches don't wear football helmets?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: Because football helmets are equipment, good only for playing football, while baseball caps are clothing, and can be worn virtually anywhere by anybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment/clothing distinction is more fluid than you might think.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, D'Artagnan's sword was equipment, but what about the swords that are part of the dress uniforms of men whether Knights of Columbus or Army officers who never use them and may not even know how?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These non-fencers' swords are elements of costume, just like their epaulettes and brass buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 10 years ago, hiking boots were equipment; now most of them are clothes. One result: Hiking boot sales have tripled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago I tried on a five-pound pair of serious-equipment-type hiking boots, the kind designed for people who feel obliged to climb tall mountains just because they're there.  They felt like a couple of concrete blocks strapped to my feet and not for nothing. You need that rigidity, the salesman explained, if you want to put on some crampons and walk straight up an iced-over waterfall or traverse a glacier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, most people who want to get out into the outdoors and have fun have something less ambitious in mind, like a three- or four-mile hike with the family. Or just something different, like trail-running or a hell-for-leather ride on a mountain bike.  Something you could almost do in sneakers, except that this is a culture that's managed to convince 12-year-olds that they need $ 100 basketball shoes to ride the school bus, so nobody has to tell these hikers and bikers and trail-runners that they need special shoes, shoes that at least look like equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't need the full steel shanks and stiff leather of waterfall-walkers, and they won't put up with the weight, or put in the month or two it takes to break a pair in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they don't have to. Lightweight, instantly comfortable hiking boots were first introduced 10 years ago; Hi-Tec's Sierra Lite andNike'sLava Dome were two of the first. &quot;We basically made our running shoes more rugged,&quot;Nike'sCraig Duerr says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's still some arguing about whether the lightweights were designed to meet the needs of casual hikers or just to create a new market niche athletic shoe companies could fill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever, lightweight hikers were a big success. Art Kenyon of Vasque, an old-line hiking boot manufacturer, estimates that today, the lightweights account for 60 percent to 65 percent of the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey by the National Sporting Goods Association, sales of hiking boots nearly tripled over the past five years though hiking increased by only 30 percent. What this must mean is that lots of the people who buy hiking boots aren't hiking in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSGA's Tom Doyle says that &quot;about 60 percent of athletic shoes are never used for their intended purpose.&quot; But when most hiking boots weighed five pounds and took weeks to break in, hardly anybody bought them to mow the lawn in. (Though, in the late 1960s, people who had bought them for mountaineering sometimes wore them to English class as a badge of outdoorsy cool.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightweights, Kenyon says, are more &quot;multi-use&quot; n other words, they're clothes, not equipment. He says people wear them &quot;to watch the kids play football, mow the grass, clean out the garage,&quot; and landscapers wear them as work boots because they're &quot;not too dorky&quot; to wear after work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lightweight hikers are mutating again to produce a new shoe category designed for what the manufacturers call &quot;outdoor cross-training.&quot; Outdoor cross-trainers, clearly inspired by the success of the geographically non-specific cross-trainers that hit the market a couple of years ago, are designed for trail running,&nbsp; mountain biking and hiking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might not think those three activities would attract enough people to sustain a whole shoe category, and you'd probably be right. But Dave Getchell, Backpacker magazine's equipment editor, points out that though only a limited number of people actually hike, run trails and ride mountain bikes, lots more like the idea and may want &quot;to identify with these nice green activities&quot; by wearing the shoes, &quot;just the way people who live in the suburbs drive Jeep Cherokees and kids who don't play basketball wear Air Jordans.&quot;- Patricia McLaughlin has written for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Washington Post and Rolling Stone magazine.",0.14769524693,0.473399814471,777 words,Nike'sprint ads,"March 17, 1991 Sunday",481 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"&nbsp;In the tennis world, Nick Bollettieri has always been the red Corvette gleaming among a fleet of beige Ford Escorts. The hustler with the big dreams. The man in the Hollywood sunglasses. How he didn't end up a cigar-chomping owner of the Yankees or a string of Atlantic City casinos is a mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, like an uninvited guest, he scraped out a place for himself in the polite sport of tennis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri, 60, has coached such top pros as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Jim Courier, Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krickstein. He also operates a 54-court tennis factory in Bradenton to nurture young players. They pour in from around the world to steep in an atmosphere of discipline and motivation. To be in the nearness of Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, as Agassi's star ascended, Bollettieri (pronounced Bo-luh-TER-i) has crossed over from coach to tennis personality.  He is negotiating with K mart and Wal-Mart to sell his $ 13.95 instructional tennis videos. He recently had his teeth bleached to a glaring shade of white. Gone is the gold jewelry that used to adorn his golden brown chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, honor and respect were bestowed on Bollettieri. The United States Professional Tennis Association named him the teaching pro of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bollettieri began giving tennis lessons in the late 1950s on public courts in North Miami Beach, he charged $ 1.50 a half-hour. Today, what little private teaching he accepts costs between $ 1,000 and $ 1,500 for a two-hour consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bollettieri is known as much for self-promotion as he is for coaching skills. He is the Don King of tennis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nick is always good for a quote,&quot; says NBC tennis analyst Bud Collins. &quot;He's always visible in the stands. And Nick always takes his shirt off so he can keep that bronze going.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this sweltering morning in early September, the Grand Master Flash is wearing pink nylon shorts, making phone calls in his small office at the tennis academy. An assistant pops through the door and reminds him he needs to make an appearance on court. It is the last day of tennis camp for a group of foreign students who have paid thousands of dollars to study at Bollettieri's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The kids from Africa, where the hell they from?&quot; Bollettieri asks, a blue Adidas tank top covers his George Hamilton tan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Arabia,&quot; reminds an assistant, as Bollettieri rustles through a stack of correspondance. He has spent most of the summer touring with Agassi in Europe, then on to the U.S. Open in New York in late August, where Agassi got bumped off in the first round. Two full briefcases await him this morning. His beagle-brown eyes are bloodshot from working long hours. He requires only about four hours of sleep. At 6 a.m., his personal fitness trainer shows up. From there, he is up and running, no coffee needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Put a P.S. on the one to Jaegg, the president of Adidas,&quot; Bollettieri calls out to his assistant, Cheryl. (He talks in a loud, slightly hoarse voice.) From his black European purse he removes a pink comb and sweeps it through his hair. &quot;Looking forward to the expo in January and spending time with you.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long relationship withNike,Bollettieri recently switched his allegiance to Adidas. That's all he wears. That's all the pro shop at the academy sells. He recently has come out with his own line of apparel, which Adidas manufactures and embroiders with the Bollettieri logo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A player named Marco calls on line one. Marco wants to study under Bollettieri and live at the academy. Bollettieri thinks he can come up with $ 20,000 so Marco can start touring, plus rackets and clothing. &quot;I've talked to IMG,&quot; says Bollettieri, referring to the powerful sports management firm. &quot;There's some interest. If I push it, they'll have a lot of interest. We've got a place for you to stay. You gotta get out there where you're knockin' heads, not that college-y stuff.&quot;&nbsp;It's nearly 11:30, and an assistant reminds Bollettieri about the kids from Saudi Arabia. He grabs his orange Donnay Pro One racket, slips on a shirt and heads for the door. He calls for an assistant to walk with him out to the courts. Bollettieri wants to hear what he found out about prices on speed boats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the courts, a young man pops out of the Nautilus room. &quot;Hey, Nick,&quot; he shouts, standing in the sun and flexing his arm muscles like Popeye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get inside, you wimp,&quot; Bollettieri yells, playfully. He is a fitness freak. If there's a lull in a conference, he'll take two chairs in his office and form a makeshift exercise machine to work on his abdominals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes big, aggressive steps for a man his size. (His glossy brochure for the tennis academy generously describes his height at 5 feet 10.) Once on the tennis court, Bollettieri charges over to a grocery cart full of yellow Penn balls. An assistant hands him three as he stands by the net and addresses the group of boys from Saudi.  &quot;You kids speak English?&quot; he asks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding balls across the net, Bollettieri doesn't even have to dip into the ball cart; perfect sets of three are handed to him by an assistant, a former Davis Cup player from Colombia. After 15 minutes of instruction, Bollettieri tells the boys to gather 'round.  Time for the goodbye speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where you guys from?&quot; he asks, and one of them says Saudi Arabia. He throws out his chin and nods his head. &quot;Hot there, cold, what?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1940s, the pristine grass courts of the U.S. Open at Forest Hills were just a subway ride away from Bollettieri's blue-collar neighborhood outside of the Bronx in New York. But tennis was for rich kids and sissies. Little Nick, he shot marbles on the street corner and tried to steer clear of his grandmother, Vera, who'd &quot;take a rolling pin and whack you in the ass&quot; if you stepped out of line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father was a pharmacist, his mother a housewife. He grew up in a big Italian family, with lots of aunts and uncles. His grandfather used to make red wine in the cellar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-50s, after serving with the 187th Airborne in the Korean War, Bollettieri enrolled in Spring Field College in Alabama to study philosophy. He began playing tennis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, he entered the University of Miami School of Law. For extra money, he taught tennis lessons at the Victory Park public courts in North Miami Beach. After morning classes, he'd drive his rattle-trap Plymouth to the park, where the asphalt courts were bumpy and the nets were made of iron mesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri charged $ 1.50 for a half-hour lesson. One of his first students was 5-year-old Brian Gottfried, who later would win doubles titles at the French Open and Wimbledon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri quit law school after a year. He taught tennis full-time.  &quot;We didn't have much,&quot; he remembers. &quot;Back then, sneakers were $ 2.35 and Jack Kramer rackets were $ 6.35.&quot; In the summer heat, he'd put up an umbrella near the Pepsi machine. That was his country club.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's reputation as an instructor grew. The Rockefeller family hired him to be the coach of a resort they owned in Puerto Rico. In 1977, he became the head pro at the Colony Beach and Tennis Resort on Longboat Key. He had the idea to invite promising junior players from around the country to train at his tennis camp on a year-round basis. Sort of like a boot camp for tennis players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students would attend academic classes at a private school in the morning and begin their workouts by early afternoons. Some students lived in a nearby motor lodge and others slept at Bollettieri's house. One of the teaching pros doubled as a chef.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the junior stand-outs who enrolled in the intensive program were Jimmy Arias, Kathy Horvath and Carling Bassett. By 1980, Bollettieri's program had outgrown the Colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had built to his specifications his 22-acre facility in Bradenton.  Today, it is a sprawling sports empire with 170 employees. During the school year, 150 students live in condominiums on the grounds.  Tuition is $ 2,600 a month, which includes private school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri known more for his motivational skills than his coaching techniques is still hoping for a true champion, one who rises to the top and stays there. Even Agassi, his brightest star, has yet to win a Grand Slam title.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, few coaches have had as many successful players as Bollettieri. One year, 32 of his students were in the draw at Wimbledon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, he sponsors a few juniors who show promise. They live and learn at the academy at no charge. In 1982, 14-year-old Ricky Brown was invited from Tennessee to study under Bollettieri. He eventually reached No. 170 in the world. Brown, who is now the tennis director at the River Crossing Country Club in New Port Richey, says his parents never could have afforded sending him to Bollettieri's academy. He lived there for almost three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He hand-picked the best juniors and gave them free rides,&quot; says Brown. &quot;That brought in other kids by the truckload.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's tennis academy is like a microwave it cooks at a higher intensity then most conventional tennis schools. Players are zapped into professionals almost overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri says he has mellowed in recent years. He says he wants kids to have fun. &quot;We're reinforcing a self-image and a self-concept,&quot; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the idea is still to produce champions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is not something that's taken lightly,&quot; says Greg Hill of North Carolina, whose son, 13-year-old Greg Jr., is one of Bollettieri's most promising students. &quot;We have a specific plan we'll be following for the next few years.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 15-year-old girl from Yugoslavia, a superb athlete, didn't begin playing tennis until age 13 ancient, compared with most other young players today, who begin swinging a racket the minute they are hatched. She now trains full-time at Bollettieri's. A tennis player is being built, literally, from the ground up. Her father stands quietly by the court as she drills and plays matches all day, handing her a jug of water when she takes a break at the net. It won't be long before she's ready for the pro tour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri has an uncanny ability to spot talent. But he is also quick to see the danger signs of overly zealous parents who think they'd make great coaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I do a deal with the little girl,&quot; he says, recalling a particular promising junior he helped. &quot;It's so good it's scary. It's four years before the girl turns pro. I told her father, &quot;If I see her hit any balls after she leaves here, you've got her. You're getting my time. We'll give her clothes, rackets, everything.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri shakes his head, thinking of all the parents who've loused up his plans. &quot;When you're waiting five years for a return . .  .&quot; his voice trails off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's very simple,&quot; he says. &quot;I decided this year, if you don't like it&nbsp; my way, take the highway.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is wheeled in on a silver cart turkey or ham sandwiches, tuna with lemon and olive oil, no mayonnaise, and fresh fruit. Rita, the chef at the academy, fixes Bollettieri's plate. The other five or six employees who are asked to dine with Bollettieri serve themselves. The sound of the Pete Sampras-Jim Courier match (which Courier would win) in the quarter finals of the U.S. Open drifts in from the TV set in the next room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sampras beat the crap out of Courier in the first set,&quot; someone reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri used to coach Courier, who grew up in Dade City but spent many of his teen-age years at Bollettieri's academy. Last April, around the time Monica Seles decided to defect from Bollettieri, Courier went his own way, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bollettieri hears how his former student is faring in the match against Sampras, he says nothing. He pours himself some tea.  He won't describe his bitterness over Seles, either. Never has. &quot;I took the right road by not saying anything,&quot; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops gathered around the lunch table quiz him about the U.S. Open. Like a hero who has just returned from the front lines, he shares his stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was on the phone with Andre for a long time last night,&quot; Bollettieri says, when the questions finally stop. &quot;And I said, &quot;You can't change what you are for the public. When you change, it's gonna affect you.' &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Agassi, 1991 has been a bust so far in the tennis department.  His shaggy mug is everywhere in hipNikeads, on MTV, in Rolling Stone but he's had problems with his game. Maybe too much fame too soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri says he's received no financial compensation for his years of coaching Agassi or any other of his proteges. &quot;I've never taken a penny,&quot; he says. &quot;And these kids are making millions and millions.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agassi gave Bollettieri a $ 60,000 Corvette ZR-1 for Christmas two years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri's annual salary as president of his tennis academy, not including endorsements and incentives? Six figures, he says, &quot;way up in six figures.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes his cars. He's lent his name to Mitsubishi Motors, so he owns several, including a ZR1 Twin Turbo. In addition to his three-acre residence on Longboat Key, where he lives with his fifth wife, Kellie, and their two young daughters, he's renovating a condominium closer to the academy. The condo has no garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The only thing that kills me is seeing my sports car out in that hot sun,&quot; he says, wistfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is cleared away. Bollettieri removes a pack of Stim-u-dents from his black purse and goes to work on his choppers. He peers through the screen door. The sun beats down and beckons all sadists outside. By 1:30 p.m., he's due on court for more instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri loves body surfing and snow skiing, but he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. He has to ask one of his assistants. He also can't remember the last film he saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like the movies, man,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know the names of them, but I like them.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he is out the door, four steps ahead of anyone who dares to follow, carrying his orange racket like a bayonet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what it's like to be No. 1 in the world?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bollettieri is addressing the group of kids in his special program. It is their second week at the academy. They are sitting down for his talk, scattered across the green clay court near the back fence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Other coaches,&quot; he says, &quot;none of them are my enemies because they're all No. 2.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives a whirlwind speech on the competitive spirit necessary for becoming a champion. His teaching pros, young men in Oakley sunglasses and Umbro nylon shorts and gold hoop earrings, stand by quietly with their brightly colored Donnay rackets. It's no surprise that the flashy Agassi sprang from this atmosphere of Day-Glo tennis mobsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the brief talk is over, brutality begins drills. Every conceivable variation on every shot is practiced, at a breathless pace. As his instructors feed balls and work on specific shots, Bollettieri walks from court to court like an inspector general. He has eyes in the back of his head. He'll have his back turned to a group of kids drilling cross-court backhands and he'll suddenly whip around to face them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what I get a little concerned over,&quot; he says, pushing his assistant out of the way so he can feed balls to the player, &quot;is you come off that forehand too slowly. Ya hug.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 10 balls, the player, a blond boy with a spiked haircut, corrects his stroke. &quot;Bee-UTY-full,&quot; shouts Bollettieri, as if cajoling a prizefighter. &quot;Beautiful, baby.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gimme some stick on that forehand,&quot; he encourages an Asian girl. &quot;You roll with it, dear. Lift it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look at him,&quot; he yells at another player. &quot;He looks like a garbage collector.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtside telephone rings. Bollettieri takes the call. It's Aaron Krickstein's trainer. Bollettieri barks some advice over the phone until something catches his eye on the court. The blood vessels on his forehead start to pulse. He has witnessed a lazy retreat for a lob.  He abruptly cups the mouthpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GET THAT BALL,&quot; he shouts, the stretched telephone cord holding him back like a leash. &quot;I'M NOT YOUR VALET. C'MON,&nbsp; JUICE IT, BABY, JUICE IT.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly, he goes back to his call. &quot;Where were we?&quot;&nbsp;",0.0981855592967,0.386317635921,2777 words,Nike'sprint ads,"March 21, 1991 Thursday",482 of 1437 DOCUMENTS

"BY HILARY DE VRIESSpecial to The Globe and MailNew YorkIT is the voice that is surprising - soft, slurry, a half-asleep whisper.&quot;Black people kissing on screen? I never saw that growing up.&quot;He says this staring out of the editing booth, watching a print of hisnew film, Jungle Fever, run over and over, the images of a black man and awhite woman reflected in his glasses.&quot;Uh-uh,&quot; he says with almost purposed distraction, an imperceptibleturn of his head. &quot;I'm attentive.&quot;It is a performance - a mastery of the deadpan, as he has put it - asintegral to the Spike Lee persona as the wire-rims, baseball cap andsneakers. Behind the glasses, his eyes are enormous, impassive. His body,a spindly afterthought ending in the soft padding of hisNikes.&nbsp;&quot;The intermingling of the races? That's always going to be a part of mywork,&quot; he says, staring at the screen. &quot;That has happened since the slaveswere brought here - stolen from Africa - when massa started sneaking inthe slave quarters at night. That's the dynamics of colour and race.&quot;Lee silently watches a few more frames. Suddenly he throws his headback and laughs, a short, raucous burst. &quot;There's one thing that black menhave that really threatens white males.&quot;Ask anyone who knows him and you will hear that Spike Lee is atroublemaker. Serious. His films - She's Gotta Have It (1986), School Daze(1988), Do The Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990) and now, JungleFever - have been sharp, repeated blows to the Hollywood axiom that blackdoesn't sell in white America.Not any more.Every one of Lee's films - black American cultural themes married to acinematic style drawn from Martin Scorsese, Japan's Akira Kurasowa and theFrench new wave of filmmakers - has made money. And each has generatedequal currency in the media, which address them as missives from the frontlines of cultural politics. When Do The Right Thing - a filmic examinationof racism in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood that seemed toadvocate violence as a means of social reform - opened two summers ago,critics and civic leaders predicted, wrongly, that it would spark riots.Lee is the most influential black American director working inHollywood today, one who is making his movies, albeit low-budget by moststudio standards, on his terms. His films have expanded the boundaries ofU.S. popular culture, altered Hollywood's perception of cross-overaudiences, and opened the door for a new generation of black maledirectors - the Hudlin Brothers, Robert Townsend, Keenan Ivory Wynans,Bill Duke among them - who are redefining the roles that blacks play onscreen and within the industry.Lee suggests that &quot;it's a combination of everything - part talent, partluck, part timing. I'm not the first talented black filmmaker to appear onthe face of the earth. If I had come along 20 years ago, the conditionsweren't conducive to this kind of success.&quot;This year, nearly 20 feature films will have been made and released byblack Americans - more than in the entire decade before. At 34 and withfive films to his credit, Lee has become something of the group's eminencegrise.&quot;Dozens of black Americans have directed films before,&quot; says RogerEbert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times. &quot;But the subtext of thosemovies was always how blacks related to whites. Spike broke through that.He defines blacks in relation to other blacks. That is brand new.&quot;She's Gotta Have It, Lee's first feature film, shot for $175,000 in16mm, explored sexuality from the unusual perspective of a liberated blackwoman. The film won the Prix de la Jeunesse award at the Cannes FilmFestival and went on to gross $8-million. School Daze probed such issuesas the clash between light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks. Do The RightThing exhumed racial bigotry and class hatred among New York's under-class. Mo' Better Blues chronicled the lives of middle-class black jazzmusicians.Now Jungle Fever, featuring Wesley Snipes, Anthony Quinn and AnnabelleSciorra, explores interracial relationships. While some critics speculatedthat the film, which is dedicated to a black youth murdered by whites twoyears ago, might prove as controversial as Do The Right Thing, thedecidedly mixed reviews of Jungle Fever did not bear that out. Meanwhile,Lee is already in pre-production on his most ambitious film to date - thecoveted Malcolm X project with a budget that may reach $30-million.There are suggestions, however, that Lee's standing within the filmindustry and the black community is due less to his talents than to hisentrepreneurial instincts and political sensibilities, which areemblematic, more than those of any other black director, of the country'sresurging interest in racial issues. Lee's cultural politics, evident inhis films and frequent public statements, reflected much of the publicoutrage voiced after the racially motivated killing in New York'sBensonhurst neighbourhood, and an earlier one in Howard Beach, as well asthe recent beating by Los Angeles police of a black motorist.Lee has positioned his career at that crossroads of art and publicityand his off-screen activities have earned him almost as much note as hisfilms. He has publicly attacked Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg andQuincy Jones as sell-out cross-over artists. He has criticized severalHollywood directors, including Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood, formaking films about black Americans. He called Edward Koch, then mayor ofNew York, a &quot;racist&quot; and said he hoped Do The Right Thing would defeat hisbid for re-election. When the film lost at Cannes in 1989, he accused thefestival jury of racism. When Jungle Fever lost this year, he said: &quot;Wegot screwed again.&quot;Lee makes commercials forNike,the sportswear manufacturer that hasbeen accused of exploiting inner-city black children - the high cost ofits products, critics say, encourages crime or violence to acquire them.He was embroiled in a public feud with B'nai Brith's Anti-DefamationLeague, which objected to the treatment of Jews in his films. And heopenly campaigned for the Malcolm X film by insisting that only a blackdirector was competent to do the job.The director has buttressed his pronouncements with growing financialclout. He is the only black American filmmaker to mass market himself theway that Eddie Murphy, Prince and Michael Jackson have. In addition to hisfilm company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Lee owns Spike's Joint, alucrative retail and mail-order business, and earlier this year, hestarted his own record label.&quot;If you don't own stuff, you have no power,&quot; Lee says. &quot;For me, that'sthe whole issue. When black people start thinking more like entrepreneursinstead of just consumers, instead of 'Please Mr. White Man, can you do soand so for me,' we will call the shots.&quot;For every critic or studio head who hails Lee as a genuine pioneer,there are those, even in the black critical community, who insist that heis neither a talented filmmaker nor a serious social critic, that theracial and economic situations of his films are exploitative -particularly of black women - and the films' political positions areundercut by a fatal, commercial-driven, ambiguity.Interviews with dozens of colleagues, employees and friends reveal aman whose entrepreneurial success has not trickled down. While Lee isconsidered something of a cultural separatist (he employs mostly blacks onhis crews and in his business ventures, with the notable exception of hislawyer, Arthur Klein), they suggest that after six years in the businesshe has become arrogant, self-interested, a multimillionaire who underpaysartists and employees. For all his public support of a new black economicsolidarity, the director has simply co-opted traditional studio-bossattitudes - a vision extending only to his own pocketbook. The mostpowerful black in Hollywood may be the most resented.&quot;Spike's single-mindedness is his best and his worst quality,&quot; saysNelson George, a screenwriter, music critic, columnist for the VillageVoice, and one of Lee's original backers. &quot;He tunnel-visions people outwhen he doesn't need them and he has not been as visionary as he could bein helping other people's careers.&quot;&quot;Spike is out for Spike,&quot; says one actor, who requested anonymity. &quot;Hetalks about black people staying together but he puts people down in thepress and it's a documented fact that he doesn't pay people well. Butbecause he's Spike Lee nobody wants to say anything and you'd be a foolnot to work with him.&quot;Lee, who still lives and works in the same Brooklyn neighborhood wherehe was raised, is unfazed by the criticism. &quot;I have no conflicts at all,about my success,&quot; he says. &quot;None.&quot;Black people should be the recipients of the money that is beinggenerated by black culture. In the past we were getting flim-flammed,bamboozled. Having talent is not enough. You have to have some businessknow-how.&quot;Lee says the idea for Jungle Fever came to him two years ago during theshooting of Mo' Better Blues, when Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old blackyouth from Brooklyn, was beaten to death by white youths who mistakenlythought he was visiting a girlfriend in the Italian community ofBensonhurst.There is a key scene in Jungle Fever between the protagonists - FlipperPurify, a married black architect from Harlem (played by Snipes) and AngieTucci, his Italian American secretary and lover from Bensonhurst (playedby Sciorra). Their brief but tension-fraught relationship is endingbecause of economic and cultural differences between them and theirrespective families and because of the issue of children.&quot;What about kids?&quot; says Angie. &quot;You and me?&quot;&quot;No. No. No babies. No mixed-race babies,&quot; says Purify, shaking hishead. &quot;Mixed-race babies come out nothing but a bunch of mixed nuts.&quot;That scene, which ends with Angie accusing Purify of exhibiting thesame kind of racism espoused by their parents, encapsulates one of thefilm's major themes - that even in a post-civil-rights era economic andeducational advances cannot erase centuries of cultural differences andracial injustices.&quot;I can see it now,&quot; says Lee with a small laugh. &quot;Spike Lee says 'No!to inter-racial relationships.' But this film is about boundaries - realand self-imposed boundaries - and what happens when you cross them. A lotof these relationships aren't based on love, but on sexual myths - thatthe white woman is the epitome of beauty and that black males are sexualsupermen. One of the things we tried to raise in the film is whethersomeone is necessarily a racist if they are opposed to interracialmarriages.&quot;Lee, who intends the film to raise questions about community andcultural identity, is himself adamantly opposed to interracialrelationships.&quot;I'm not attracted to white women on that level. But I understand thereare black men who are.&quot; Indeed, his father Bill married a white woman,Susan Kaplan Lee, after the death of Jacquelyn Lee, his first wife andLee's mother. Friends say the remarriage remains a painful subject for thedirector today.(Lee is coyly cryptic about his personal life, insisting he is &quot;married  to cinema.&quot; His long-time relationship with Cheryl Burr, a dancer he met  while studying at New York University and to whom he gave a small part in  She's Gotta Have It, ended a couple of years ago. More recently, Lee has  been linked with model Veronica Webb, who has a small part in Jungle  Fever.)     One of Jungle Fever's most powerful scenes features a frank discussion  among several black women who are &quot;looking for a strong black man to  date.&quot; Although Lee had scripted the scene, after two days of rehearsals  most of the actresses were ad-libbing. Says Lee, &quot;The actresses are  espousing their own views - 'Who am I going to marry? There are not enough  black men out there.' That's the reality that black women are facing -  that they don't have a great choice.&quot;It is an issue about which the director has strong personal feelings.&quot;Racism has taught black people to hate themselves. And if you hateyourself, then why would you want somebody - one who has made you hateyourself - as your mate? Black people have been pounded by the media withthe image of white women as the epitome of beauty. That has an effect onyour subconscious.&quot;The oldest son of a jazz musician and a school teacher, Lee attributeshis awareness of the issue to his own upbringing. He was the thirdgeneration of his family to attend Morehouse College, the prestigious all-black men's college in Atlanta, where he was born in 1957, and spent mostof his summers visiting his grandparents in that city. &quot;In the thirtiesand the forties my grandmother was colouring birthday cards, Christmascards, my mother's dolls with brown magic marker,&quot; he says. &quot;That's howour family was raised. It was a conscious effort on my grandmother's partwho did not want her children and grandchildren growing up thinking blackwas ugly.&quot;&quot;Spike comes from a really strong family base,&quot; says one of Lee'sclosest friends, jazz trumpeter Bradford Marsalis. &quot;He never hung out withthe crowd. He had his sights set on bigger things.&quot;&quot;I don't know if I can say there is black esthetic in filmmaking yet,&quot;Lee says. &quot;It has to be developed over time and we're still in ourinfancy. There is definitely a black esthetic in music, art and dance. . .. For me black (culture) is a lot more interesting. A lot of white cultureis dying out. I know (whites) think that (too) because they try and stealeverything they can and make money off it and then have audacity to callit their own.&quot;People are co-opted who want to be co-opted. People who have powernever give it up voluntarily. You never stop working towards that goal.Some say this country will never stop being racist; well, that doesn'tmean you throw up your hands. You acquire your own power, taking awayother people's power over you. That's just taking back what should havebeen yours anyway.&quot;",0.0839544132985,0.434403940394,2305 words,Nike'sprint ads,"September 1, 1991 Sunday",486 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
"BY HARVEY ENCHINThe Globe and MailIN 200 stores across Canada, the Bata Shoe Organization is putting theboot to high prices and banal marketing.But its $1-million media blitz is more than a manipulative ploy; it isthe first outward sign of - with apologies to Mao Tsetung - a culturalrevolution sweeping through one of Canada's blandest companies.&quot;The employees believe there's a revolution going on in Bata and thatthey're part of it,&quot; asserts Martin O'Neill, president of Bata's Canadianunit. &quot;It's starting to manifest itself in the way we perform. We're beingmore successful and they're having more fun.&quot;The company, ruled paternalistically for 53 years by Thomas J. Bata,had earned a worldwide reputation as a staid supplier of low-pricedfootwear. But by the time Mr. Bata turned the helm over to his son, ThomasG. Bata, in 1985, it seemed out of step with market trends and globalcompetition.&nbsp;Bata, for example, missed the boat on running shoes, turning up itsnose when given the opportunity to finance the start up of ReebokInternational Ltd., today a world leader in athletic footwear. AlthoughBata now has high hopes, its own brand of Power athletic shoes has milesto go before it catches up toNikeInc., Adidas AG or Reebok.And when it comes to the art of advertising, Bata has lagged its rivalsby light years. The last time Bata swept customers off their feet withmarketing finesse was in 1922 when it pioneered the 50-per-cent-off sale.Until the recent campaign, created by the Canadian arm of D'Arcy MasiusBenton &amp; Bowles Inc., a New York agency, Bata had relied more on in-storepromotions preaching quality and good value.The new multimedia blitz is a reflection of the emerging corporateculture radically transforming tradition-bound Bata. In an extensivetelevision, radio and newspaper campaign, combined with point-of-salepromotion and home-delivered flyers, the company declares itself therevolutionary republic of Bata and proclaims its independence fromCanada's high prices. It takes dead aim at cross-border shopping with theclaim that Bata's prices are the same as or lower than those of itscompetitors in the United States.&quot;I think what they're doing is great,&quot; said Michael Budman, co-founderof Roots Canada Ltd., noting that his stores had a cross-border promotionin May offering a 30-cent premium on the Canadian dollar. &quot;It took us sixweeks to realize the devastating affect of the GST on the Canadianconsumer. Then we took an aggressive stand on our pricing, giving thecustomer every reason to stay in Canada.&quot;The elder Bata, a long-time anti-Communist, might be shocked by hiscompany's guise as a revolutionary republic, complete with nationalanthem, passports and banners in rebellious black and red. Yet since hisown father applied Henry Ford's mass production methods to the footwearindustry, turning his hometown of Zlin into the Detroit of Czechoslovakia,the 97-year-old company has been somewhat of an empire unto itself. Insome parts of the world, bata is the word for shoe and Mr. Bata and hiswife, Sonja, are treated as heads of state.Now 76, Mr. Bata has pretty well completed the succession of his throneto his son. In his autobiography, he expresses satisfaction that no seniorexecutives resigned in the process.But, in fact, new management blood is the main ingredient in Bata'srejuvenation. The average age of the executive team has dropped to 43 fromnearly 55 in five years.Though he joined Bata only three months ago as a key member of thatteam, Martin O'Neill, a lanky 40-year-old native of Northern Ireland, isleading the charge for change.&quot;It really is beginning with Martin,&quot; said personnel manager PaulGiroudy. &quot;He is bringing to Bata a new corporate culture. And in thisculture people are learning to put an ear to the ground and listen to whatis happening out in the marketplace and then to respond to what the marketis telling us.&quot;The cultural revolution is happening in-house and it's happening withMartin coming on board.&quot;A devotee of Japanese manufacturing techniques, new age managementmethods and the hard sell, Mr. O'Neill, an economics graduate from LondonUniversity, melds marketing and motivation in his remedies to revitalizeailing companies.&quot;We've rewritten the mission statement for the Canadian company,&quot; hesaid in an interview. &quot;We will be No. 1 in the marketplace. We will befaster than the competition.&quot;Mr. O'Neill is responsible for 800 stores in North America and 100 inBritain as well as four factories in Mexico and one each in Canada, theUnited States and Britain. His retail and manufacturing operations employ5,000 people, a fraction of Bata's total work force of 70,000.&quot;We're relatively insignificant in the First World compared with theThird World,&quot; he explained, noting Bata's overwhelming presence in Asiaand Africa. &quot;I've sat in meetings making major investment decisions forcountries where the economics looked good so I was very positive. Butafterwards I had to ask someone where the country was even thoughgeography was part of my degree.&quot;Mr. O'Neill is no stranger to global companies. He began his career in1974 as an international market research co-ordinator with NV PhilipsGloeilampenfabrieken, the Dutch electronics giant. Two years later, hemoved to Germany to work for Braun AG, the small appliance subsidiary ofBoston-based Gillette Co. From 1978, he was Braun's marketing manager inBritain until he emigrated to Canada in 1981 as vice-president ofmarketing, becoming president of Braun Canada in 1984. During his tenure,sales increased five-fold.In 1988, he turned down a promotion that would have taken him back toGermany and instead took the top job at Rubbermaid Canada Inc., a unit ofRubbermaid Inc. of Wooster, Ohio. At the time, the parent company wasintroducing the sorts of changes that Bata now is adopting.Within a few years, Mr. O'Neill had awakened Rubbermaid's sleepysubsidiary, which doubled in size and now boasts sales of more than $100-million. He helped nurture a cultural change from a conservative,traditional company to what his successor, Larry Porcellato, calls a high-performance environment.Mr. O'Neill's tenure was characterized by an aggressive approach tomarketing, involving extensive television advertising, and a liberalapplication of consumer psychology, Mr. Porcellato said.By creating demand for its products, Mr. O'Neill turned RubbermaidCanada's fortunes around to the extent that it could operate seven days aweek at a time when it previously would have cut production and reducedstaff, Mr. Porcellato said.Mr. O'Neill has brought his abhorrence of layoffs to Bata. &quot;We considerlaying off people as basically bad management.&quot;While Bata's advertisements trumpet that Keds cost less in Canada thanin the United States, Mr. O'Neill says price slashing is not the wholegame plan. His strategy is to compete on speed rather than cost, an ideahe borrowed from Milliken &amp; Co. of Spartanburg, S.C., a carpet and textilemanufacturer, which cut its production time from 20 weeks to seven days inorder to gain a competitive edge over Asian carpet manufacturers.&quot;If we can deliver shoes in 24 hours versus the Chinese who take ninemonths, we have a major and significant advantage that has dramaticimplications for all retailers,&quot; he said. &quot;The key is to increase yourstock churns as opposed to just maintaining your gross profit margin.&quot;With the introduction of electronic data interchange at its plant inBatawa, Ont., the company will be able to manufacture shoes that will sellwell in the store. &quot;If they're buying size 9s, we'll be making size 9s,&quot;Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;It's a whole new concept of manufacturing to orderrather than manufacturing to stock.&quot;The strategy involves just-in-time inventory control and productioncircles rather than assembly lines at the plant; rapid-fire decisionmaking and huddle management rather than a formal reporting mechanism athead office.&quot;Their goal is to supply shoes as quickly as possible,&quot; said GaryAlcock, vice-president of public affairs and human resources for rivalAgnew Group Inc. of Brantford, Ont., which operates 342 shoe stores inthree retail chains. &quot;It's questionable as to how this is going toincrease their sales and volume.&quot;Most alarming from Agnew's perspective is that by price cutting Bata isgiving up margins. &quot;In retail you have to make a profit,&quot; Mr. Alcock said.&quot;You have to have a future.&quot;But Mr. O'Neill is convinced of the rightness of his path. &quot;We're justgoing to be faster on our feet than any of our competitors. That's ourmission.&quot;",0.0749528176502,0.448183147262,1421 words,Nike'sprint ads,"September 1, 1991 Sunday",487 of 1437 DOCUMENTS
