"Nike Inc. yesterday named Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson to its board of directors.
Thompson, a Nike spokesman since 1980, becomes the first minority-race board member at Nike, which expects $ 3 billion sales in sports and fitness shoes, clothing and accessories for its fiscal year ending May 31. 
The naming of Thompson follows criticism last July by Operation PUSH and its leader, Jesse Jackson, that Nike was exploiting blacks and had none in upper management. In August, Operation PUSH urged a boycott of Nike products, and Nike publicly said it would name a black to its board within a year. The next month, Thompson arranged a meeting in his office between Operation PUSH and Nike officials.
""I've had an opportunity to know [Nike chairman] Phil Knight,"" Thompson said on a tape provided by Georgetown. ""I have a lot of interest and a lot of curiosity, particularly as it applies to the business world. And this will afford me an opportunity to expand my knowledge and at least give some more input of my feelings about the business world.""
Thompson will make $ 10,000 a year to sit on the board, plus $ 2,000 for each of six annual board meetings. His first board meeting is next month.

" Nike has an unusual rival in the Barcelona Olympics: Juan Amigo Freixas, a Spanish lawyer who says he owns the Nike trademark in Spain.
In 1981, Freixas bought this 1932 trademark from a knitwear manufacturer: a photo negative of the headless Winged Victory of Samothrace, a statue in Paris' Louvre Museum that has ''Nike'' on its pedestal. That, he says, gives him the Nike trademark for apparel in Spain.
Nike protested, but a Spanish civil court ruled otherwise, enjoining Nike from selling apparel there.
Nike has lobbied various U.S. government agencies and trade groups in a two-year legal battle and has appealed to the Spanish Constitutional Court - which might rule soon.
Until then, Nike hopes for a reversal, or at least a ruling that doesn't broaden Freixas' claim beyond apparel. And, says Nike counsel Lindsay Stewart, the company has made contingency plans: ''The obvious gift of a T- shirt wouldn't be included in our giveaways.''

"Nike Inc. filed a lawsuit today against L.A. Gear Inc., charging its rival with incorporating a Nike-patented design in its new Catapult basketball shoe.
The suit, filed in Federal District Court here, says some elements of L.A. Gear's Catapult cushioning system infringes two Nike patents. The patents, covering what Nike calls a ""spring moderator device,"" are not now used in the company's shoes. Instead, Nike has an air-cushioning system that uses pressurized gas. 
 Like Nike's spring moderator, L.A. Gear's Catapult shoe has a cushioning system designed to improve the jumping performance of wearers.
While Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., does not use its system on any shoe, Lindsay Stewart, Nike's general counsel, said it was important for the company to protect its designs. ""We spend a lot of money on research and development and we don't want to see it abused.""

" Next week, newspaper ads paid for by a Washington D.C.-area foundation will ask you to send your ''dirty, smelly, worn-out'' Nike shoes to Nike chairman Philip Knight and to not buy a pair until Nike builds ''a manufacturing plant'' in the USA.
But Nike spokesman Dusty Kidd says that might leave you barefoot: ''You can't make shoes profitably in this country. People wouldn't buy them. They'd be too expensive.''
The ads will come from Made in the USA, a Chevy Chase, Md., foundation whose backers include labor unions and manufacturers. The group wants to call attention to its claim that 65,000 U.S. footwear jobs were lost in the 1980s. It plans to spend about $ 1 million on ads targeting Nike, says chairman Joel Joseph.
Nike shoes are assembled in Asia. But Nike's Kidd says that shoe components are made in the USA, creating 1,162 full-time jobs in Nike's U.S. work force.
Made in the USA says Nike's Asian subcontractors pay Indonesian workers 14 cents an hour. Nike's counter: That's four times the average local wage.

That doesn't mean Nike Inc. is fed up with Mr. Sanders, as many fans were after the seventh game of the National League Championship Series celebration, when he poured buckets of water on CBS sportscaster Tim McCarver, apparently in retaliation for some on-the-air criticism. 
Nike still stands behind Mr. Sanders, a Braves outfielder and a Falcons cornerback whom Nike pays $ 1 million a year to endorse its cross- training sneakers. His commercial just ran out its two-month cycle, Nike said.
""He had a rough week,"" said company spokesman Dusty Kidd of the McCarver controversy and of some fans' criticism that Mr. Sanders is more concerned about his Nike deal - which pays him an extra $ 900,000 a year to shuttle between the Braves and Falcons - than he is about the Braves winning the World Series.
""But he's still a .300 hitter, he still had the most triples in the [National] league, and he's still an All-Pro cornerback,"" said Mr. Kidd. ""In some people's minds, maybe [the controversy] does tarnish him. But we stand behind him.""

Basically, Nike's process grinds and pulverizes whole shoes to make material that can be used for the outer soles of new shoes. 
Nike says it can completely recycle every shoe it makes except the ones with cleats. So far, it doesn't have machinery to separate metal from rubber and fiber.
The first Nikes to contain recycled material will be in stores next spring. The shoe will be a version of one of Nike's best sellers: the Air Escape Low, a mid priced outdoor cross trainer.
Nike says a sole with up to 20% recycled material performed as well and sometimes better than regular soles in laboratory tests.
Nike says once it gets its patent, it will let other companies use its recycling method.

" Nike Inc. of the U.S. expects to report relatively flat earnings in its second fiscal quarter ended Nov. 30, says chairman Philip H. Knight.
 A year earlier, the sports shoe and apparel maker earned US$58.1 million (C$66.4 million), or US77 cents a share. Knight indicated that Nike's per-share earnings for the recently completed second quarter ranged from US75 cents to US80 cents.
 In recent years, Nike has commonly reported big quarterly earnings jumps, but a flat second quarter would be something of a victory in these recessionary times.
 Knight declined to give specific estimates and didn't discuss revenues for the period. A year ago, Nike had revenues of US$648.8 million. Knight's comments indicate that Nike will earn roughly between US$57 million and US$61 million for the fiscal second quarter.
 In the fiscal first quarter, Nike earned US$114.4 million (US$1.50 a share) on revenue of US$947.2 million. Fiscal first quarter earnings were 15% above profits in the year-earlier first quarter.

"    Nike Inc., which paid millions to put its name on the U.S. track and field team's uniforms at the Barcelona Olympics, is appealing a stunning high court decision that bars the advertising or sale of Nike apparel in Spain, a company attorney said yesterday.
 Spain's Constitutional Court last week refused to lift a lower court order prohibiting the Beaverton, Ore. -based company from using the Nike name on clothing because a Barcelona firm registered the trademark first in 1932.
 Nike, whose shoes are not affected by the ruling, planned to use the Olympics promotional campaign to launch a new line of sports clothes.
 If further legal actions fail - and if the courts rule the injunction bars U.S. athletes from wearing Nike uniforms - the firm stands to lose US$20 million in sales in Spain alone and many times that sum worldwide.
 ''We do not believe we've lost the battle by any means, much less the war,'' said John Faylor, Nike's European lawyer.
 But the decision clearly left Nike at a disadvantage in its long-running dispute with Juan Amigo Freixas, the Barcelona lawyer who bought the Nike name from the original registrant, who briefly made socks during the 1930s.
 Amigo has reportedly asked Nike for US$30 million for rights to the brand, according to Faylor, who has called the Spaniard a ''pirate.''
 Nike, however, claims the decision won't keep athletes from wearing its name when the Games open on July 25 because the International Olympic Committee does not consider the uniforms to be a form of advertising or promotion.

In its counterclaim, Nike, No. 1 in the athletic footwear industry, contends that Avia abandoned its original Cantilever outsole, rendering the patent invalid.

"A new book about the inner working of athletics shoe and apparel giant Nike alleges steroid use by Nike-sponsored athletes and widespread under-the-table payments to amateur competitors. ""Swoosh, The Story of Nike and the Men Who Played There"" was written by sisters Julie Strasser and Laurie Becklund. Strasser was Nike's first advertising director and her husband, Rob, was the marketing whiz during the company's meteoric rise to national prominence in the 1980s. Becklund is a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. Nike says the authors took a slanted approach because Rob Strasser, who left Nike in 1988, now heads a consulting company whose clients include Adidas, one of Nike's major competitors. Julie Strasser says Adidas didn't hire her husband's company until after publishing rights to the book were sold.

" Nike Inc. officials warned that second-quarter earnings may not match the record performance in the first quarter. Earlier yesterday, Oregon-based Nike reported first-quarter net income of US$114 million (C$130 million), or US$1.50 a share, on revenues of US$947 million, compared to 1990 first-quarter income of US$99.7 million, or US$2.62 a share, on revenues of US$833.6 million. Nike said first-quarter results benefited from a big increase in ''at-once'' sales. Those sales - not booked as future orders - rose 45% in the quarter ended Aug. 31. In a telephone conference call with analysts, Nike officials said it is unlikely ''at-once'' sales will reach that level in the second quarter. Nike said the first quarter's record revenues and earnings reflect growth in all its brand divisions and other brands. Domestic footwear revenues increased 5% to US$558.3 million, while domestic athletic apparel grew 24% to US$98.6 million over last year. International sales rose 37% to US$248.3 million over last year, while revenues from other brands, such as Cole Haan and Tetra Plastics, rose 8% to US$42 million.

"To the Editor:
After reading the rhapsodic article about the new Nike Town building in Chicago (Styles of The Times, July 19), I believe it is time to disclose the secret of Nike's success. 
 According to the August issue of Harper's magazine, the workers (mostly women, poor and malnourished) in the Nike factory in Indonesia are paid $1.03 a day, not enough for food and shelter. A pair of shoes that retails for $80 in the United States costs 12 cents to make. Nike's profits (the company had sales of $3 billion last year) are earned on the back of the third-world poor.
Let no one justify this exploitation by arguing it provides work for people who would not otherwise be employed. This would be the equivalent of justifying slavery on the ground it gave work to idle black Africans.

" Being the world's leading sports gear marketer makes Nike an obvious target for critics. The latest call for a Nike consumer boycott - a U.S. manufacturing group - is running ads faulting Nike's use of labor in developing countries. 
Nike chairman and founder Phil Knight says the company has little choice about using such labor in order for compete with its rivals here and abroad.
After losing $ 20 million on a factory in Saco, Maine, that closed in 1985, Knight concluded ''Americans don't want to make shoes'' - at least at going global rates. At a Nike subcontractor in Gwangzhou, China, workers make about $ 85 a month, nearly double the salary of professors at Beijing University.
Then there's the idea, as Sports Illustrated put it, that Nike has helped ''a fantasy-fueled market for luxury items ... (that) led to a frightening outbreak of crimes.''
Knight doesn't see Nike's sought-after sneakers as having a causal effect on crime: ''Nobody jumps on Toyota if its cars are used in drive-by shootings.''

"Nike Inc., the nation's largest marketer of athletic shoes, reported today that its third-quarter earnings jumped 12 percent, but the performance disappointed Wall Street and Nike's stock price tumbled.
The company earned $70.7 million, or 93 cents a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28, up from $63.1 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Nike said revenues shot up nearly 39 percent in the third quarter to $802.2 million from $577.9 million a year earlier.

Nike said higher costs had cut revenues, reflecting advertising expense for the introduction of several new products. Nike said it planned to continue its heavy advertising.
Selling and administrative costs as a proportion of sales rose to 22.7 percent, from 19.9 percent last year. Interest costs in the quarter jumped to $9.7 million, from $2.5 million, partly reflecting higher borrowings to accommodate a planned rise in inventories.

"Responding to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by Nike Inc., L.A. Gear Inc. denied today that its new Catapult shoe infringed two Nike patents.
L.A. Gear said technology used in the Catapult did not infringe a cushioning system patent held by Nike. The company said the United States Patent Office had previously not objected to L.A. Gear's use of technology that might appear similar to Nike's. 
 L.A. Gear also said its shoe's lacing system did not infringe another patent held by Nike. The company said it would defend itself against Nike.
L.A. Gear said separately that it had filed for a deadline extension to March 15 from March 1 on the recording of some financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Because the company has posted losses, L.A. Gear said it was out of compliance with covenants on a $360 million bank line of credit and needed to evaluate the results of continuing negotiations. The company said it expected to conclude talks with lenders and might announce a new agreement by March 15.

"On July 14, ""Prime Time"" will hit prime time when Nike airs Deion Sanders's first national commercial during the All-Star Game.
The 30-second spot, which will promote a new type of cross-training shoe, features Deion the football player, the baseball player, the dancer, the father, etc. 
The commercial is the first in what is expected to be a series of Deion/Cross Trainer ads for Nike. Sanders signed a multiyear deal with Nike in mid-May.
Nike will premier a new Bo Jackson commercial on the same night. Both ads are narrated by fast-talking MTV comic Denis Leary. Sanders has a three-word script; Jackson does not speak.
In Sanders's spot, Leary talks about how ""Deion is so busy he needs two nicknames, Prime Time and Neon Deion.""
Sanders is shown with the Falcons, with the Braves and in various off-field activities including walking his daughter Deiondra, washing his car and hanging with his ""posse.""
But according to Sanders, the toughest part of the commercial was attempting to dance like rap star Hammer. In one part, Sanders is shown dancing to ""2 Legit To Quit.""
""I've got a lot of respect for Hammer,"" Sanders said. ""It's so tiring. I thought I could move, but dancing is something else.""
Jackson's commercial focuses on his rehabilitation from hip socket replacement.

" Quit gasping about player contracts such as Bobby Bonilla's $ 29 million deal with the New York Mets. A new book, Swoosh: The Story of Nike and the Men Who Played There, explains that sports business successes sometimes come with a lot more zeros on the bottom line. 
Nike founder Philip Knight, a former University of Oregon runner who began with little more than an idea from one of his papers in business school, was instantly worth $ 178 million when the Beaverton, Ore., company went public in 1980.
During Super Bowl XXVI, Nike says it will debut a TV ad that pairs Michael Jordan with ''one of the most powerful icons of the 20th century.''
But the company's less-cosmic early days, as shown by co-authors J.B. Strasser and her sister, Laurie Becklund, sound a lot more fun:
- The company's name came to one of the founding workers in a dream. (Knight wanted ''Dimension Six.'')
- Nike got its air-cushioned shoes only because it listened to an unemployed aerospace researcher ignored by others.
- An art student designed the Swoosh logo for $ 35.
But in detailing Nike's ups and downs, the authors are instructive. Women, not to mention minorities, were never in the management loop - even as Nike was dismissing the fledgling aerobics craze as ''fat ladies dancing to music.''
And Nike only survived, arguably, because of early backing from a Japanese creditor - U.S. banks were too timid - and because Nike overcame regulatory interference from the U.S. government. Litigation became Nike's standard operating procedure.
The authors conclude that ''the individualism that made Nike different is gone, but so is the spirit that made employees care.'' Then again, today's Nike workers can't just do it - it already has been done.

"Nike Inc., which has been under fire from some blacks, named John Thompson, Georgetown University's head basketball coach, who is black, to its board of directors yesterday.
Nike is one of the world's largest sellers of athletic shoes. Among its most enthusiastic customers are urban teen-agers, many of whom are black. Last year, Operation PUSH, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, charged that Nike did not hire enough blacks. 
 In August, Nike pledged to name a someone from a minority to its 11-member board within a year. Liz Dolan, a Nike spokeswoman, said that adding a minority member had been planned for some time.
Of Nike's 4,500 employees, about 8.5 percent are black, Ms. Dolan said. Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., markets shoes that are manufactured by independent contractors elsewhere, typically in the Far East, and does not, therefore, have a large factory work force.
Mr. Thompson's teams have been in every N.C.A.A. tournament since 1979 and the 1984 team won the N.C.A.A. national championship. He has been a consultant to Nike since 1980 and has spoken at Nike sales meetings and coaches' clinics and made appearances to promote Nike products in Europe and Asia, where they are less well known than in the United States.
He was also head coach of the United States 1988 Olympic basketball team, and is the second Olympic coach to join Nike's board. The first was Bill Bowerman, co-founder of Nike and an Olympic track and field coach in 1972.
Mr. Thompson was not in his office at Georgetown yesterday; a spokesman for the university said he was traveling.
Mr. Thompson, 49, is a member of no other corporate board. He will be paid the customary $10,000 annual director's fee and $2,000 for every bimonthly director's meeting he attends.
While sales of many expensive athletic shoes have languished, those of Nike have continued to thrive, although at a slower pace than in earlier years. In the year ended May 31, 1990, Nike earned $243 million on annual revenue of $2.2 billion. Analysts said that in the year ending next week, Nike's robust foreign sales would help lift revenue past $3 billion and earnings close to $300 million.

" This city has two examples of the purest form of megastore - a store devoted to just one brand.
Nike Town Chicago showcases the range of Nike products, representing 20 sports. But where megastores end with vast size and selection, stores such as Nike Town add theatrics. 
Peter Alles of Columbia, Mo., was admiring goods in one of three basketball departments. ''This is different from a mall sports store, where they've already decided what to show you,'' he says. ''My son is downstairs, enthralled by the Aquasocks display.''
The Aquasocks display includes a 22-foot tank of tropical fish. The floor is made of video screens running water images. It's called a video pond. Sean Alles, 11, was so impressed by the pond, he ignored full-sized athlete mannequins suspended from the three-story ceiling, a regulation-height basketball hoop with a massive photo backdrop of Michael Jordan, even a display of Batman's boot, designed by Nike.
Nike Town and many other one-brand stores charge full price to avoid angering their regular retailers. But few visitors leave without bags. Nike Town T-shirts are one of the top sellers. Two more Nike Towns are planned this spring in Atlanta and Orange County, Calif.
Next door is Sony Gallery of Consumer Electronics. The store displays Sony's full line and its newest technologies, such as an XBR(2) Trinitron TV. ''This is a showcase, for our customers, even for our retailers, to see Sony products at their best,'' says Sony's Rick Clancy. Other features: a home entertainment center, complete with wall-size movie screen; an auto-like room for sampling car stereo products; Walkman stereos set up with batteries and tapes fill half the second floor.

"Bobby Cremins was paid more by Nike ($ 130,000) than he earned in salary as Georgia Tech's basketball coach ($ 105,000) in 1990.
The greatest portion of Cremins's income - $ 162,878 - came from his television show.
Cremins's agreement with Nike consists of two parts - consulting and appearances on behalf of the shoe company. And because the Georgia Supreme Court ruled Cremins's personal appearances on behalf of Nike are not subject to the Open Records Act, the $ 130,000 does not include any income he might receive for those appearances. 
Despite the ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Frank Hull, which was upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court, Cremins maintained, ""I consider this disclosure of documents pertaining to his athletically related outside income an invasion of my privacy.""
Cremins's income does not include the value of perquisites such as the use of a luxury automobile, membership in the Indian Hills Country Club and health/life insurance, all provided by the athletics association.
Here are some stipulations in the five-year Nike contract Cremins signed on June 16, 1987:
- If Tech is put on probation by the NCAA which results in a prohibition of TV appearances, Nike can reduce the $ 130,000 annual payment to $ 65,000 during the probation period.
- Cremins receives up to $ 4,000 (wholesale value) in Nike merchandise for use at his summer camps and clinics and up to $ 2,500 (retail value) of Nike merchandise for his personal use, plus ""such quantities of Nike basketball shoes as he may reasonably request for his own personal use."" Three assistants each get $ 500 in merchandise.
- Tech receives 135 pairs of shoes for the men's basketball team and one set of practice apparel for each team member.
- Cremins agrees to ""make Nike shoes available to members of the Georgia Tech men's basketball team, to be worn during practices, games, clinics and other occasions in which team members wear basketball shoes. . . . shall describe to members of the team the advantage of Nike basketball shoes and suggest they wear Nike basketball shoes.""
- Nike agrees not to advertise the fact Tech's team endorses Nike products or ""in any other way advertise or indicate that Nike athletic shoes are the official shoe' "" of the team.
- Cremins agrees to advise Tech president Patrick Crecine and/or athletics director Homer Rice of the income he receives from Nike, and to secure the administration's approval of the stipulations and approval that permission for the team to wear Nike shoes.
- Nike has the right to terminate the contract if Cremins is convicted of a felony or ""publicly admits the use of cocaine or other illegal hard drugs specifically excluding marijuana ,"" if Cremins ceases to be head coach at Tech or another ""major"" Division I team or if the program receives a ""death penalty"" sentence from the NCAA.

"Sneaker fads may be fleeting, but athletic shoes may last for decades. That's why Nike Inc. is introducing sneakers made of recycled materials.
Nike, the country's largest athletic shoe manufacturer, said that starting in the spring it would sell a new version of its Air Escape Low shoes with soles made of about 20 percent recycled materials. The shoes, to be priced at $75, will be sold in boxes made of recycled paper. 
 Nike, whose sales in the fiscal year 1992 totaled $3.41 billion, wants to prevent old sneakers from building up in landfills and other waste-disposal sites. Last year, 388 million pairs of athletic shoes were sold, according to an article in the current issue of Omni magazine.
At first, Nike plans to recycle its defective footwear, but it is applying for a patent for its technology to re-use old sneakers. The process involves a giant Cuisinart that grinds whole shoes into small bits that will later be used in material for new soles.
""Once our patent application is accepted, we'll make that technology available to any other shoe company in the world that wants it,"" a Nike spokesman, Dusty Kidd, said.
By the fall of 1993, Nike intends the seven styles it makes for outdoor sports to have soles made of recycled material, a company spokeswoman said. The next step would be to use recycled materials in its basketball shoes, aerobic shoes and running shoes.
""Maybe at some point -- way in the future -- we'll have a system where shoes can be 100 percent recycled, where you never throw a pair away,"" Mr. Kidd said. ""You'd always take them back like bottles or other common recyclables.""
